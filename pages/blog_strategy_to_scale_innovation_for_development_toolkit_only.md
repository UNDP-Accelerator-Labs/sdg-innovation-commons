Introduction

This Toolkit version of the report aims to provide a hands-on strategy to help Accelerator Labs
scale social innovation in the Grow stage. As social innovation is complex and may generate long-
term and sustainable impact, scaling social innovation is also intricate, layered, and nonlinear.
The research for the report was based on a collaborative approach that provided opportunities for
all 60 Labs to contribute insights from their unique perspectives. This was done to ensure that the
report is anchored in the realities that Accelerator Labs are facing and that the strategy is
applicable in different contexts. Data and insights were collected from Accelerator Labs through
a survey, phone interviews, and deep-dive research interviews with specific Accelerator Labs as
well as their local partners and stakeholders. Then, the assumptions and recommendations of the
scaling strategy were tested through virtual focus groups to verify if the research process was
able to capture the Labs’ views. In total, 46 out of the 60 Labs were engaged through at least one
of these research tools. Together with secondary research made up of literature reviews, the
findings have been aligned with the UNDP Accelerator Labs Team at headquarters in New York
and Accelerator Labs out in the 60 countries.

The report has two main parts: A scaling framework and a toolkit. The scaling framework outlines
three types of social innovations and three types of scaling, for more information, please refer to
the full report. The toolkit provides guidance and recommendations to Accelerator Labs on scaling
social innovation under four different sections: Envisioning Scale, Supportive Ecosystem for
Scaling, Resources for Scaling, and Learning from Scaling. The components under the
Envisioning Scale theme provide guidance on how to create a structured vision that will help
provide a better chance of scaling. The Ecosystem for Scaling section addresses relevant factors
in creating a more cohesive political and socio-cultural context for scaling, and how to leverage
key actors in the innovation ecosystem. The Resources for Scaling section stresses the facilitation
of access to necessary resources for scaling, with recommendations for capacity building,
financial sustainability, knowledge sharing, legal aspects, and policy frameworks. Finally, the
Learning from Scaling section specifies how Accelerator Labs and the communities can extract
and share knowledge from their scaling efforts both individually and collectively.

1. The Scaling Toolkit

The scaling toolkit is offered in the context of the SDGs, taking into consideration resource
limitations and ecosystem challenges of Accelerator Labs.

Image 1: Working model of the Scaling Strategy, including the framework and the toolkit

1.1. Introduction and Instructions

The aim of this toolkit is to provide Accelerator Labs with guidance on the key themes of scaling
a portfolio of innovations. It provides recommendations, which are brought to life through stories.
Recommendations build on the comprehensive methodology outlined in the original report, such
as conversations with Labs and secondary research. In addition, tools such as the guiding
questions are intended to help Accelerator Labs think through and design a successful scaling
strategy applicable to respective contexts. The insights outlined here build on the various
conversations with Accelerator Labs and stakeholders at all levels, the survey, and secondary
research, and are intended to lay out cross-cutting aspects around scaling.

The toolkit has been designed with applicability to product, process, or service line innovation in
mind, but may also be applied when exploring any other type of innovation. Also, the toolkit
demonstrates how the cross-cutting benefits of a portfolio approach can go beyond the benefits
pertinent to the different types of “innovations” if scaled in silos. The toolkit pertains to various
aspects relevant to enabling the innovation ecosystem to scale social innovation, no matter its
nature or the end goal. As it is clear that there is always room for improvement and that no one
cannot internalize all the extraordinary experience and knowledge of Accelerator Labs, none of
the themes or recommendations below are meant to be definitive, but instead recommendations.
Similarly, this toolkit will not cover every aspect of scaling or potential challenges that may arise,

4

rather it aims to address common themes and questions that Accelerator Labs have indicated
over the course of this research. Context and need will always be the main pillars of bottom-up
innovation, and thus this report will rely on Accelerator Labs to take this toolkit and adapt and
improve it based on these essential aspects.

How to use the toolkit? Horizontal instead of sequential reading - The toolkit is divided into four
sections, each composed of different components. It is recommended to direct the reader’s
attention specifically to the most relevant components (horizontal reading) Instead of using the
toolkit vertically and reading sequentially through the whole document.

These are common themes that are critical in scaling a social innovation that were identified in
our primary and secondary research. The four sections help Accelerator Labs think openly and
broadly on where support is needed. Within each section there are 4 to 7 components. These
components, which contain 1) recommendations, 2) guiding questions, and 3) stories, help
Accelerator Labs think critically and focus on the specific questions to find context-specific
answers. Not all the components and corresponding tools will be used by each Accelerator Lab,
rather each Accelerator Lab should identify what support and guidance is needed to go directly
to the relevant component(s).

The reader can expect the following content from the toolkit:

1.2. Envisioning Scale

Envisioning scale means creating a shared vision early in the innovation process that will help
provide a better chance of scaling. If the whole portfolio of solutions, or some part of the portfolio
does ultimately scale, starting off with a structured vision will result in more efficient use of
resources in the long run. The key components of this vision for scale include defining the
challenge in the light of scaling, application and enhancement of the portfolio approach, assessing
the scalability, setting goals for scaling, and defining who is scaling.

1.2.1. Joint Challenge Definition

The nature of the problem that an Accelerator Lab chooses to address can also have an impact
on its scalability depending on the respective country context. Therefore, in the process of
choosing a relevant challenge to solve through scaling innovation, analyzing different aspects,
including political realities, innovation trends, government priorities, support from the UNDP
Country Office and stakeholders on the issue, and work currently being conducted by other UN
Agencies will provide more information on the relevance of the issue in the context of the
ecosystem, which would impact its scale. Therefore, it will be important to conduct an analysis at
the beginning of the work cycle to identify a pertinent challenge that is relevant in the country
context and would garner the necessary support from ecosystem actions.

Objective: To enable Accelerator Labs to analyze and identify pertinent and relevant challenges in their
country context

Recommendations:

1 Analyze the existing policy priorities of the government in the country.

2 Align with the UNDP Country Office on its long-term development vision for the country.

3 Analyze the existing work of other UN Agencies on similar or related issues to identify gaps and

understand limitations.

4 Conduct a pre-identification “market-testing” with the community to understand the relevance of

addressing the issue. Identify who and how supportive potential stakeholders might be.

5 Develop a preliminary projection on the potential impact of addressing the challenge in the country

context.

6 Analyze the social innovation ecosystem to identify and map trends on the issues being addressed.

7

Guiding Questions:

1

Is the problem that has been identified pertinent to the context of the country?

2

Is the government of the country invested in the problem through policy/initiative?

3

Is the UNDP Country Office currently engaged in the issue or any aspect of it?

4

Is the challenge a part of the UNDP Country Office long-term development vision for the country?

5

Is any other UN Agency engaged in the issue or in an aspect of it?

6 Has there been increased traction on innovations to address the issue in the region/country?

7 Does the community affected by the issue identify the challenge as a priority for its well-being?

8

Has the Accelerator Lab conducted early ecosystem mapping to position the importance and
relevance of the issue-identified across various aspects, including social, economic,
environmental, political, and technological (e.g. PEST), among others, to position its priority?

Stories:

The Serbia Accelerator Lab is working on the issue of depopulation in the country. The
issue was identified after an analysis of the socio-economic realities and government
policy priorities. As there is a consensus on the need to address this challenge, the
Accelerator Lab has seen increased ecosystem support to tackle the issue.

The Palestine Accelerator Lab is working with the Prime Minister’s Office along with
twelve working groups on SDGs. This provides a platform to identify and address cross-
ministerial challenges to achieving SDGs. Through this exercise, the Palestine
Accelerator Lab is also able to identify targeted solutions to the identified problems.

1.2.2. Scalable Innovation

This component addresses practical aspects in scalability of social innovation. Scalability refers
to the social innovations’ ability to scale in any of the three ways this paper has outlined. It guides
Accelerator Labs through different areas that are relevant to look at when assessing if a solution
is scalable1. The Accelerator Labs Network is a learning network and the toolkit is designed in a
way that learning happens from component one to wherever an Accelerator Lab shifts. Even if
scalability is not reached, lessons learned can be applied up to the point of realization, decision
to not proceed, and when the Accelerator Lab embarks on its next cycle of work. The learning
section provides further insights in terms of how to learn from “failure.”

1 The “issue map” worksheet from NESTA that is available here, p. 76, can be helpful for Labs to think about scalability.

8

Objective: To help Accelerator Labs and their network think through the scalability question

Recommendations:

1

Pursue scalability in the SDG context. The following tools can help visualize the SDGs addressed
and their interlinkages: SDG interlinkages and SDG Dashboard

2 Assess scalability in relation to other solutions in the portfolio.

3 Assess scalability together with impacted communities before pursuing scaling.

4 Recognize that when something is not scalable, it is still a learning opportunity.

Guiding questions

1

2

3

Is it possible to identify a strong case for action, such as an urgent need?

• Which (combination of) SDG(s) are the Accelerator Lab working towards?
• What is the current level of need in the community?
• The opportunity size: To what extent can the innovative solution decrease the need level?
• What hypothesis are these assumptions based on in order to meet such a need?
• Through which experiments can these hypotheses be tested?
• What evidence do Accelerator Labs have that the portfolio of solutions works?

Is it possible to identify the right leaders: people with the necessary vision and resources?

● Who knows most about the potential for growth of the innovative solution?
● What (un)common data sources and inputs can be tapped into?
● What are connections with the efforts/investments made by the government and key stakeholders?
● Has there been increased traction on innovations to address the issue in the region/country?
● Is a handover to the UNDP Country Office, private sector ventures or policy change/government possible?
● Can Accelerator Labs seek guidance from others who are already working at scale?
● Can Accelerator Labs consult communities of practice, companies, governments and organizations

working in the Accelerator Labs’ region or sector, and learn from their experiences?

Is it possible to discover the right solution/an effective and viable portfolio of solutions?

● Does the innovation meet the scaling goals criteria? (see below)
● What potential adverse effects could scale the social innovation have?
● Does the innovation factor in innovation-related rights?

Early testing:

● At what stage is the innovation currently at?
● What is the timeline since the conception of the solution?
● What are the early challenges faced to launch the solution?
● Is there documentation of proof of concept?
● Is there a lean and agile method to test the solution to assess the viability of scaling? (e.g.: prototype,

localized implementation)?

● Is there a community of local adopters who have been identified and engaged?

9

Early traction:
● Is there market or community demand for the innovation?
● What are the tools used to assess the target market/community demand for the innovation?
● Has there been early output/outcome mapping for the innovation?
● Is there evidence on achieving the early outputs for the innovation?

Is it possible to take the “right” approach and assess capacity (further details on this
question can be found in the resources section)?

● What supportive policy, regulation, and standards exist or need to be put in place?
● What existing human capacity is available for the scaling phase?
● Can Accelerator Labs build on existing technologies, systems or platforms?
● What are the financial expectations? If applicable, does the solution have a viable business model,

with a clear overview of cost structures and potential revenues?

● Are the implementing actor’s systems and processes capable of operating at a higher volume, or

capable of expanding?

Is it possible to recognize that when something is not scalable, it is still a learning
opportunity?

Even if the scaling is not concluded or does not reach the envisioned endpoint, lessons learned can
5
be applied up to the point of realization, decision to not proceed, and when the Lab embarks on its
next cycle of work.

Story: Social Innovation Academy (SINA) in Uganda

Uganics2 is a mosquito repellent soap company which was incubated in the Social Innovation Academy (SINA) in
Uganda. SINA helped the innovator of Uganics, “dream big” at the beginning of the project and pushed for selling
the products across multiple stores. However, as the scaling goals were reviewed, Uganics realized that certain
constraints, such as transportation infrastructure and the vast rural population of Uganda, would make it more
effective to scale up the idea and encourage local production, then establish a supply-chain for their product. In other
words, Uganics wanted to support innovators across Uganda by disseminating how to make and sell the mosquito
repellent soap, rather than Uganics selling all across Uganda. Uganics believed ideas and knowledge would be able
to overcome the physical obstacles that products faced.

2 Uganics and the Social Innovation Academy are two stakeholders of the Uganda Accelerator Lab.

1.2.3. Scaling Goals

Setting goals for scaling from the beginning is key to envisioning scale. While this report cannot
provide Accelerator Labs with all-encompassing goals for scaling that will be applicable to every
regional and SDG-context, it can, however, help Accelerator Labs ask the right questions in order
to set up lists of goals for scaling. This is specifically addressing the question: Is it worth scaling?
If it is likely to fulfill certain goals, it is also likely to be worth scaling. It is recommended to set
goals for scaling in the initial stages of problem and solution identification. Additionally, make sure
that the goals for portfolios that are worth scaling (determined in the scalability component),
otherwise move on to the learning section (e.g. learning from failure). Also, it is suggested to align
on suitable goals with key stakeholders, and while doing so, clearly define the Accelerator Labs
role in scaling, as well as to clarify expectations of the UNDP Country Office regarding goals for
scaling.

Objective: To help Accelerator Labs in developing their own sets of goals for scaling

Recommendations:

1 Go through a process for setting goals.

2 Make sure there is alignment with partners and stakeholders on the goals.

Guiding questions3:

1

Is the portfolio of solutions relevant beyond their initial context? Is it possible to build on existing
technologies, systems or platforms (unless there is a very clear reason why something new is
needed)?

2

Is the portfolio of solutions relatively simple?

3

Is the portfolio of solutions clearly better than the alternatives?

4 Does the portfolio of solutions not rely solely on the talents of specific individuals?

5 Does the portfolio of solutions have the ownership of key stakeholders?

6

Is the portfolio of solutions designed with the user?

7 Does the portfolio of solutions have the potential to match the level of need of the community?

3 This is building on: Gabriel 2014.

Stories:

\

Raising Gabdho Foundation, an innovation lab in Uganda, highlighted the challenge their
innovators face when balancing between social impact and profitability. Donors typically prioritize
social impact. However, innovators require constant sources of funding to continue scaling, and
thus, these entrepreneurs begin seeking profit generating activities. Some donors do not expect
this and at times the funders accuse the innovators of corruption. On the other hand, innovators
may lose interest or motivation without seeking profits and financial independence. Thus, Raising
Gabdho Foundation highlighted the importance of early alignment between donors and innovators
on the long-term scaling goals. Specifically, the balance between social impact and long-term
financial funding.

Goals are a more concrete and detailed version of a long-term vision. Many Accelerator
Labs already have a long-term vision for their work. The following is a compilation of
different long-term visions that Labs have shared in this research project:

●

●

●

South Africa: Ideally Accelerator Labs want to “work themselves out of a job” -
that would necessarily serve their vision of enabling an ecosystem that is self-
sufficient and sustainable to scale social innovation.

Zimbabwe: “I hope the UNDP Country Office will function as an Accelerator
Lab” - UNDP Country Office shifting from project management approach to
problem solving approach.

Ecuador: “Planting a seed in different actors” - to enable learning in the
ecosystem.

● Kenya: “Serving beyond UNDP to other UN Agencies.”

● Chad: “Make innovation more visible in the region, ensuring intellectual

property for innovators.”

●

●

●

India: “Hard to know when funding is only to 2021” - Not clear mandate for
mobilizing funding beyond 2021.

Viet Nam: “Build similar Labs within government and other organizations.”

The Gambia: “The way the Accelerator Labs work should also be a natural
way for the UN agencies to think.”

12

1.2.4. Who Is Scaling?

Previous components of the envisioning scale section have been referring to the importance of
stakeholders and partners, i.e. in order to scale there needs to be an understanding of who will
do what in the scaling process. The “Who” question also is key to building a vision for scale. For
Accelerator Labs, scaling is defined in the context of an innovation ecosystem. Thus, this report
suggests an ecosystem approach, in which the Accelerator Lab functions as an “enabler” that
supports the innovation ecosystem within a specific country in scaling a social innovation for
development. This is different from the ecosystem section, because while this is “Who,” the
ecosystem is the “How” to engage with stakeholders for scaling, focusing on the specifics of each
stakeholder. The goal of this section is to get Accelerator Labs to think of the potential actors, the
different “Who,” that may exist and need to be engaged in the scaling process. Through the earlier
parts of the working cycle, Accelerator Labs will have an understanding of what actors are relevant
to the space the Accelerator Labs are working in. This part of the toolkit will help them identify
who is specifically relevant when scaling.

Objective: To clarify “who” is scaling to be able to look in detailed at specific ecosystem actors in the
following section on the “ecosystem”

Recommendations:

1 Map4 the Accelerator Labs in-country innovation ecosystem.

2

Identify key innovation champions.

3 Position the Accelerator Lab as an “enabler” of the innovation ecosystem.

Guiding Questions:

In mapping the Accelerator Labs’ innovation ecosystem, a few key questions can help clarify the
roles of key stakeholders in the ecosystem:

1 Who would be paying for the scaling of the portfolio of social innovation solutions?

2 Who would be delivering the scaling of the portfolio of social innovation solutions?

3 Who would be using the social innovation solutions of the portfolio?

4 Who would be benefiting from scaling of the portfolio of social innovation solutions?

5 Who can influence the impact of the scaled portfolio of social innovation solutions?

4 The “stakeholder map” worksheet by Nesta that is available here, p. 78, can be helpful for Labs to map the in-country innovation ecosystem.

13

Story:

In its efforts to address deforestation, the Uganda Accelerator Lab has identified an
unusual partner that may be able to have a large impact on the success of the work –
Her Royal Highness the Nnabagereka/Queen of the Kingdom of Buganda, Sylvia
Nagginda. The Queen has the potential of amplifying the overall work of the portfolio in
regard to the issue of deforestation. In addition, the monarchy has the authority to inspire
people to change their lives in multiple ways and may serve as an influencer across
multiple issue areas over time.

1.3. Supportive Ecosystem for Scaling

The ecosystem for scaling looks beyond social innovation itself and at the different actors within
the innovation ecosystem involved or impacted in the innovation process, and how their
interactions with one another and the scaling environment impact this process. The ecosystem is
“characterized by an array of interacting organizations, individuals (collectively referred to as
“actors”), elements, relationships, and conditions that either enable or impede innovation.”5 The
scalability and sustainability of a social innovation is connected to the ecosystem – how engaged
and aligned the different elements of the ecosystem are on the innovation.

Innovation does not happen in a vacuum but instead exists amongst moving parts that are
continually evolving and changing. Rather than being a fixed and stagnant environment, the
ecosystem may evolve, adjusting to fit the needs of the innovation through the various stages of
scaling. Mapping out and thinking about the ecosystem allows innovators to reflect upon the
current enablers and barriers as well as what conditions are needed to support the scaling
process. These components outlined in the supportive ecosystem section of the toolkit will help
guide Accelerator Labs in identifying if and how ready the ecosystem is for scaling. The
stakeholders highlighted as components in this section reflect stakeholders with whom many of
Accelerator Labs referenced engaging throughout our research; it is important to highlight that
there are numerous other actors (i.e. academia, media, sector-specific actors) who may engage
in the scaling ecosystem and the ones highlighted here are not the end-all be-all.

1.3.1. Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement is a process of organizing and interacting with relevant actors who may
have an impact or be impacted by the innovation, its scalability, or the overall portfolio.
Stakeholder engagement looks at information and resource sharing, vision alignment, capacity
development among other components. Stakeholder engagement goes beyond looking at “who”
as part of the scaling environment to “how” to coordinate and engage these actors. Accelerator
Labs are playing a unique role to ‘bridge’ stakeholders together and organize interactions to
create greater synergies. Their position within UNDP along with working in a small team allows

14

an Accelerator Lab to be agile and engage both large and small stakeholders. It is important to
acknowledge that scaling innovation will not benefit all stakeholders equally, and some may even
experience negative impact from the innovation. Similarly, not all stakeholders hold the same
weight of influence and importance. It is critical to assess how each stakeholder fits in the
ecosystem, to what level the stakeholder could/should be engaged, and then approach the
stakeholder accordingly to leverage the partnership to reach the scalability of the solutions.

Objective: To coordinate collaborations and resources of stakeholders to create a more cohesive
ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

2

Map out all stakeholders engaged and the respective resources and expertise each stakeholder
brings. (Nesta has created useful stakeholder mapping worksheets here)6

Assess the stakeholder map to see where there is duplicated efforts, room for better coordinate
efforts, and more suitable roles for stakeholders that can contribute to a more systematic approach.

3 Facilitate a process where stakeholders should clearly define and align roles.

4 Define and align the Accelerator Lab’s role with the different stakeholders.

5

Initiate early engagement with stakeholders to build collective ownership of the scaling process.

6

Map resources (e.g. finance, specialized equipment, knowledge repository, training, mentorship)
with stakeholders to identify what each stakeholder can provide and coordinate logistically the use
of outlined available resources. See section 3 on Resources for Scaling for further guidance.

7 Build trust and create safe and neutral space for engagement of all stakeholders.

8

Identify the skills and insight each stakeholder brings and coordinate a systematic way of information
sharing through platforms (e.g. via Google Drive or Dropbox) and communication channels (e.g.
WhatsApp chats, regular meetings, emails) among stakeholders.

Guiding Questions:

1

Has the Accelerator Lab identified ‘unusual partners’ who could provide alternative insights to scale
innovation?

2 How can stakeholders be engaged early on to ensure ownership?

3 Are there barriers preventing stakeholders from engaging with one another?

4 Are there potential stakeholders who are not being engaged within the ecosystem?

5 Are all stakeholders aligned on the vision for scaling?

6 DIY Development Impact & You. n.d. https://diytoolkit.org/tools/people-connections-map/

15

6

Are there 'champions' of the innovation in hard to reach sectors or organizations that advocate for
the innovation?

7 How are local communities engaged?

8

Is there a clear pathway for communication between stakeholders?

9

By engaging with certain stakeholders, does that threaten potential engagement with other
stakeholders?

Stories:

The South Africa Accelerator Lab did an environmental scan and built an internal matrix to
assess the innovation ecosystem in the country. Through identifying partners and stakeholders for
accelerating implementation towards the SDGs, the Accelerator Lab found coordination,
interaction, and collaboration among the actors as one of the key areas to improve the ecosystem.
For More Details: Access the report here
Grassroots Innovation: Missing Link In The Innovation Ecosystem In South Africa

The Kenya Accelerator Lab partnered with the Aga Khan University to create a pilot program that
trains out of school journalists as an effort to tackle the larger challenge of youth unemployment.
The Accelerator Lab saw this as an opportunity to leverage the local journalists as solutions
mappers on the ground as well as bridge the information access divide. Through this pilot program,
the Aga Khan University provided technical journalism skills and the Accelerator Lab brought in
the solutions mapping linking it to the SDGs and the Decade of Action and seeing how we could
use the Labs tools like issue mapping to unpack some of the challenges the journalists were facing.
The young journalists shared their insights and ideas on how to address some of the challenges
around youth unemployment and understanding what is happening on the local level.

1.3.2. Building Partnerships

Building partnerships looks at how to engage and build partnerships with actors within the country
in which scaling is taking place. When thinking about new partnerships, the Lab should search for
ones that will have added value, whether it is opening the Accelerator Lab to a new network of
stakeholders, resources, or knowledge. A partnership is a one-on-one individualized relationship
that looks at achieving a joint goal together, unlike stakeholder engagement which looks at
interactions and coordinated efforts among a group of actors. A potential partnership should look
at how to get supportive resources for scaling. When building partnerships, it is important to
remember that not all partnerships will have the same timeline; some partnerships will be
essential only for the initial stages of scaling while others may be critical for the entire process.
Identify sustainable partnerships early on, who have the capacity and interest in the innovation to
engage it throughout the scaling process. In addition, assess when and where in the scaling
process each partnership fits and structure the partnership accordingly. Unlike the stakeholder
engagement component, this component focuses on building new partnerships, which helps the
scaling process acquire the supportive resources needed for scaling.

16

Objective: To identify and establish partnerships with actors who can support and bring added resources
to the ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

2

3

4

5

Agree on the components of the relationship and what each side brings in the beginning. This will
help reduce the risk of power imbalance. (NESTA has additional worksheets and checklists relevant
to establishing partnerships and respective roles.)7

Identify resources, knowledge, or capacity that is absent and target partnerships that can strengthen
these points.

Differentiate the short-term and long-term partnerships and adjust engagement and expectations
accordingly. Different stages of scaling may require different resources or knowledge, and structure
partnerships according to the various needs of the scaling process to maximize the added value
from the partnership.

Create long-lasting partnerships with stakeholders who have common interests/goals, aligning the
partnership along the shared vision.

Develop partnerships with leading academic institutions (e.g. universities, research institutes, think
tanks etc.) who bring in expertise/knowledge and are able to test potential solutions.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

Are there certain skills/training/knowledge the Accelerator Lab is missing that could enable scaling
of social innovation, which could be strengthened through a partnership?

Can sustainable partners be identified to invest resources (e.g.: time, money, infrastructure, etc.)
for the longevity of the innovation?

3

Is there a partnership and engagement strategy to continuously bring in new partnerships?

4 How can the Accelerator Lab’s partners help mobilize resources?

5

Have the Accelerator Lab’s partners/stakeholders been categorized and documented for future
access?

6 How does this partnership support the scaling environment and further the scaling process?

7 Are there legal documents/contracts outlining the partnership and terms of engagement?

8 What can the Accelerator Lab/partner offer that makes for a flourishing partnership?

Stories:

The Gambia Accelerator Lab believes how one enters and engages in a partnership is
critical. The Accelerator Lab emphasizes to potential partners that it is not about picking
winners but rather, partners who are first movers and will solve the problems the
Accelerator Lab is focused on.

The Ukraine Accelerator Lab is creating a toolkit for communities to identify
environmental problems and support these communities to solve the problems with
nature-based solutions. Some partners only see the Accelerator Lab and UNDP as a
top-down approach and the Accelerator Lab is looking for potential partners who share
the vision of a community driven bottom-up approach. Through a new partnership with
Biodiversity Foundation, a Ukrainian foundation, the Accelerator Lab is working to have
the toolkit available directly for communities, putting greater decision power in the hands
of local communities.

1.3.3. Conducive Innovation Policies

Another aspect of the ecosystem are the policies, cultural norms, regulations, and political
frameworks where scaling occurs. Policies and norms can help shape incentives to scale social
innovations through regulating the sector, funding opportunities, and intellectual property laws.
However, just as policies can encourage and foster an environment of innovation, policymaking
can stifle scaling whether that is accessibility to capital or the market. Accelerator Labs should
analyze the current policies and see how to best align scaling goals with current policies or engage
with the government to collaborate on developing policies that better support an environment for
scaling of innovations.

Objective: To identify and align with policies that support innovations and the scaling ecosystem

Recommendations:

1 Advocate for innovation-friendly policies (i.e. policies that support intellectual property laws).

2

Involve local government in the design phase and address key community concerns.

3

4

Engage the government, especially those who are champions of innovation, for entrepreneurial
friendly policies.

Think of the long-term impact the innovation may have on policies for future innovations and their
scalability.

5 Evaluate if there are current policies that could better leverage the scaling goals.

18

Guiding Questions:

1 Are there policies that may pose advantages/barriers for scaling?

2 Are there certain policies that need to be in place to support the scaling process?

3 How can scaling this innovation impact policies to support future innovations?

4

If policies do not align with the scaling goals, are there measures that can be set in place to protect
the scaling process from these potential barriers?

5 Are there ordinances or cultural norms that will shape the scaling approach?

Stories:

Serbia has been part of a growing tech economy, and many digital nomads have been moving to
Belgrade to be part of this growing sector. The Serbia Accelerator Lab is working with Digital
Serbia Initiative, a Serbian NGO, on a project to advertise Belgrade as a digitally friendly city and
making it an attractive destination for digital nomads. Recognizing how this project can help
counteract the depopulation trend Serbia is facing, the government of Serbia has aligned its efforts
with Digital Serbia Initiative and the larger tech industry to support growth of this sector. The
Serbian government has put in place regulations around the digital economy to strengthen the tech
industry as well as attract digital nomads and other migrants to Serbia. Since one of Digital Serbia
Initiative’s outcomes aligned with the national agenda on depopulation, both of their efforts helped
to further one another’s goal.

1.3.4. UNDP Country Offices

Accelerator Labs are uniquely positioned to connect UNDP with local actors. The SIPA Team’s
research suggested this is among the key aspirations of both Accelerator Labs and the UNDP
Country Offices. Both recognize the symbiosis in this relationship, and as an agile and flexible
entity, Accelerator Labs are able to employ different methodologies. Accelerator Labs and the
UNDP Country Office should work together to mainstream and collaborate on innovative
methodologies that challenge traditional approaches. When thinking about innovations to scale,
the Lab should identify which solutions fit into the portfolio of projects and the larger agenda of
the UNDP Country Office. Advocates and supporters within the UNDP Country Office must be
identified based on who can support the scaling efforts.

_________________________________________________________

“It's not a Lab of the three of us but rather 20, 30, 50 people from the office who are
early adopters of innovative methodologies who want to change the usual way of doing
business of UNDP.”

Serbia Accelerator Lab

19

Objective: To integrate and collaborate with the UNDP Country Office to mainstream efforts to create
an integrated ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

Integrate the Accelerator Lab’s process/service line and understanding within the UNDP Country
Office. Share relevant learnings and methodology processes in a timely manner. Be open to
feedback and adjustments and incorporate them where applicable.

2

Identify early adopters within the UNDP Country Office who can support the scaling process.

3

4

Align with the UNDP Country Office on the goals of portfolios/projects and how these goals align
with the long-term vision.

Assess the general relationship between the Accelerator Lab and the UNDP Country Office. Ease
any concerns and build a cooperative and trusting working relationship whether that is through
monthly meeting updates or joint brainstorming and working sessions.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

Are there system barriers that could hinder the scalability of an innovation that the Accelerator Lab
and UNDP Country Office can work together to overcome?

Can the UNDP Country Office provide introductions to potential partners, especially those beyond
the country network?

3

Is there a pathway to integrate the Lab’s methodology and learnings in the UNDP Country Office?

4 How does the innovation align with the portfolio of solutions of the UNDP Country Office?

5 Are there other roles the Accelerator Lab can play to support the UNDP Country Office?

6

7

Are there ways to improve the working dynamics between the Accelerator Lab and UNDP Country
Office?

Is there open communication or does the work of the Accelerator Lab and UNDP Country Office feel
out-of-sync?

Stories:

The Paraguay Accelerator Lab noticed early on that there was distrust from the UNDP Country
Office. The Accelerator Lab worked to change that by creating a learning and sharing session with
the UNDP Country Office on a monthly basis. This was a workshop to teach different methods and
tools to the UNDP Country Office (e.g. Theory of Change). The Accelerator Lab highlighted how
there is still a need to clarify the activities conducted and to what extent the Lab is able to go
beyond the existing UNDP Country Office portfolio. However, the relationship between the
Accelerator Lab and UNDP Country Office is a growing and working relationship that will evolve
throughout the course of engagement.

20

The Democratic Republic of Congo Accelerator Lab has received a role in the UNDP Country
Office’s Strategic Policy Unit. The implication is that the Lab has greater influence on the strategic
and policy decisions at the highest management level of the UNDP Country Office and can benefit
from the strategic and policy advice/expertise of this unit. It can potentially give the Accelerator
Lab more "power" in making sure these methods are used within the UNDP Country Office. This
exemplifies how the Accelerator Lab can be integrated and mainstream its methodologies and
understandings into the larger UNDP Country Office framework.

1.3.5. Government

Based on the survey conducted with Accelerator Labs, many indicated how the government is
seen as a key actor for scaling. The government is usually one of the largest actors in any scaling
ecosystem with a large capacity for support of innovations, whether that is through passing
innovation supporting policies, interagency supporting coordination throughout the country (in
either or both public and private sectors), or directly partnering in scaling. Getting government
support and engagement can be crucial in ensuring the sustainability of an innovation.

Objective: To find ways to incorporate government support and engagement to enable scaling

Recommendations:

1 Align innovations with government priorities and strategies.

2

3

4

5

6

Get buy-in from members of government to support the sustainability of social innovation through
directly engaging in the scaling process or by vocally supporting the innovation’s goals.

Be mindful of the political climate and how it can reshuffle government priorities and involvement in
the scaling process. Assess if an innovation is tied to a political priority of a political party/official or
is it a larger more universally accepted innovation across political party lines.

Engage the government, especially those members and officials who are champions of innovation,
for entrepreneurship-friendly policies.

Focus on aligning the innovation and its scaling strategy with the mission of a ministry (i.e the
Ministry of Health or Ministry of Education).

Engage with a senior government agency (e.g. Office of the Prime Minister) to provide senior
government guidance and ensure line ministries are actively engaged in the innovation ecosystem.

Guiding Questions:

1 Does the innovation align with the government’s priorities and strategies?

2

Is there governmental support for the innovation?

21

3 How may engaging the government alter engagement with other stakeholders?

4 Will engagement with government persist if there is a change in political climate?

5 Do elections and change in administration present barriers for the scaling process?

6

Are there specific ministries and government offices that the innovation aligns with its goals and
agenda?

Stories:

The Uganda Accelerator Lab is looking at different solutions to address climate change, and one
area of focus has been the rapid levels of deforestation in the country. In order to address this
challenge, the Accelerator Lab has been working on projects to understand the drivers of
deforestation and create efforts to combat it. To understand the deforestation issue and work on
sustainable solutions, the Accelerator Lab organized a workshop between illegal loggers,
government, universities, incubators, FAO, and Global Pulse to collaborate on solutions to
deforestation. It was the first time the government sat with the illegal loggers and worked together
on sustainable solutions. The Accelerator Lab provided a politically neutral space where illegal
loggers felt comfortable to engage in dialogue with government officials about deforestation. In
situations like this, the Lab can facilitate a neutral space and encourage unlikely stakeholders to
work together.

1.3.6. UN Network & Agencies

The breadth of the UN Network presents a valuable asset to Accelerator Labs from knowledge
and experience resources to new stakeholder and partnerships to capacity support. Many of the
UN agencies have in-house innovation incubators and portfolios of projects that are being worked
on. Rather than create new projects or approaches, coordination must be enhanced with the
respective UN system partners to enhance the reach and impact of the innovation. Similarly, many
of these agencies have specialized knowledge on certain subjects and have projects and goals
to address them. Building on this knowledge and specialization can help Accelerator Labs have
width and depth in the scaling strategy.

Objective: To engage the relevant UN agencies and network within the country to foster a cohesive and
integrated ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

Integrate the Accelerator Lab’s process/service lines and understanding within the UN system.

2

Identify synergies across different UN agencies. Some mandates overlap with some of the
experiments the Accelerator Lab is running - focus on aligning and enhancing each other’s work
rather than duplicate.

22

3

Align on efforts (e.g. service lines, events) so that one another's work complements and supports
each other when possible.

4 Build off of one another’s contacts and networks.

5

Coordinate with agencies that have specialized knowledge on the topic the innovation addresses
to share their insights and experiences.

Guiding Questions:

1

Is there an opportunity to collaborate/partner with other UN agencies working on the same issue?

2 How can the Lab’s findings and process/service line be shared across agencies?

3

Is there a repository of knowledge and training from other UN agencies easily available?

4 How can the larger UN network be engaged in the innovation?

Stories:

The Gambia Accelerator Lab is focusing on youth unemployment. One of its projects
is a jobs alert/job matching platform. With a high mobile phone penetration rate in the
Gambia, the Lab is looking at how to make this platform mobile friendly (i.e. sending SMS
notifications). The UNDP Country Office has been posting jobs on this platform and the
Lab is working with UNCT to have them use this platform as well.

The India Accelerator Lab is working on air pollution in the National Capital Region.
While the issue of air pollution has several pieces, the India Accelerator Lab was able to
leverage the work and resources of UNEP through successful collaboration and
knowledge sharing.

1.3.7. Community Engagement

Engagement with the community is among the most crucial factors necessary to scale social
innovations. While all components under the toolkit should ensure that this is achieved, integrating
methods to engage with the community will support the Accelerator Labs achieving the required
number of people, impacting the necessary institutional frameworks, and in bringing about a
cultural change. Engaging with communities through a targeted, collaborative and culturally
sensitive process is also key to achieve the large-scale impact that social innovation envisions.

Objective: To develop a strategy to engage the community to scale social innovation

23

Recommendations:

1

Identify clearly the conceived outputs, outcomes, and impact for the community.

2

3

4

Create a communication strategy for awareness on the positive outputs, outcomes, and impact on
the community that has been achieved or is expected to be achieved.

Collaborate with media, community leaders, and other partners to communicate to the community
effectively.

Engage with the UN Communications Office to align the collective narrative to enable community
engagement.

5

Identify local organizations to position strategic affiliations to build community trust.

6

7

9

Reduce information and cultural barriers by using accessible platforms and language to connect to
the community.

Engage community representatives for feedback to assess expectations and the envisioned impact
of the innovation.

Deploy the 5 R framework - Readiness, Receptivity, Resources, Risks, and Returns8 from the
perspective of the community to enable uptake.

Leverage digitals tools such as UNICEF’s RapidPro9 and U-Report10 platforms to engage with a
broader base of the community.

Guiding Questions:

1

4

What is the Accelerator Lab’s current strategy to encourage community engagement to enable
scaling of social innovation?

Is the Accelerator Lab mapping the community ecosystem and their priorities using tools such as
empathy maps, or the 5 R framework, or other methods to analyze and improve community
engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab conducting community engagement activities, such as awareness
campaigns, information dissemination activities, and participatory programs, to increase community
engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab engaging with relevant stakeholders, such as the UN Communications Office,
media, community leader, to develop strategic narratives to increase community engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab taking measures to develop relevant and effective content that overcomes
cultural and language barriers to increase community participation?

Is the Accelerator Lab partnering with any local communities for trust-building with the community
to enable greater engagement for scaling innovation?

Has the Accelerator Lab identified potential digital tools/platforms to improve community
engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab using tools that are easily accessible and practical for the communities to
engage?

Stories:

The South Africa Accelerator Lab is working with the national radio and local celebrities
to disseminate information on the impact achieved by the UNDP. This is an important
preliminary step to ensure that the information opacity among communities on the work
being conducted by the UNDP, including the work Accelerator Labs, is reduced and there
is greater community engagement. In addition, the South Africa Accelerator Lab is
working with communities through innovation hubs to better understand the realities of
people in communities.

The Ecuador Accelerator Lab was inspired by the “human library” movement in
Denmark and created its own citizen engagement platform, where people engage
through stories connected to SDGs using a simple Google form. Following the
preliminary sharing of stories over the online platform, the Ecuador Accelerator Lab
conducted in-person storytelling workshops for the community to increase engagement
and use storytelling as a tool for social change. This became a platform for networking
and an enabler of scaling.

1.4. Resources for Scaling

Along with a supportive ecosystem, tapping into the necessary resources to scale innovation is
essential. As Accelerator Labs lead this process, it is imperative to create access to these
resources either in-house or through collaborations with the government and other players in the
ecosystem. Here, access is key. Identifying, synthesizing, and streamlining the relevant resources
would facilitate and enhance access. Accelerator Labs can also leverage the available resources
in the UN system to bridge the gap.

25

1.4.1. Capacity-Building Measures

Resources for capacity building for social innovators and entrepreneurs is necessary to enable
scaling. Limitations in skills (particularly technical and management), leadership abilities, and
socio-cultural barriers must be identified on a continual basis, and resources provided to rectify
and overcome these.11 For this, various innovative models of capacity building can be deployed.
While the conventional models directed towards individual capacities are required, Accelerator
Labs can also explore developing collective networks of “social entrepreneurial capital”.12 This
component delves into resources that Accelerator Labs can provide to enable capacity building
for scaling.

Objective: To provide resources to enable capacity building of innovators for scaling innovation

Recommendations:

1

2

3

4

5

7

Encourage innovators to conduct skill mapping exercises on a regular basis to identify gaps in
human capacity to identify, and manage resources to scale innovation.13 Additionally, keep the
process dynamic to integrate changing needs.

Provide pre- and in-service training on overarching and transferable skills (e.g. networking, financial
management, industry standards, marketing, and team management).

Onboard a formal network of stakeholders/partners to support capacity building measures for social
innovators/entrepreneurs.

Create a portfolio of capacity-building resources through strategic partnerships to enable easy
access to innovators.

Develop a mentorship program. Identify thought leaders in relevant sectors and match them to the
innovators for personal training.

Establish a centralized repository of knowledge resources, including articles, podcasts, and video
training, to enable access for innovators.

On-board capacity building partners such as educational and training institutions to achieve
quality-compliant skill training.

Guiding Questions:

1

What are the skills required to scale social innovation, e.g. technical, financial management,
communicative, business-related and managerial?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with the government, both local and national, to bridge the gaps
(e.g. subsidized workshops, mentoring, and access to knowledge resources)?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with other stakeholders/partners (e.g. private sector, civil
society, and incubators) to bridge the gaps (e.g. subsidized workshops, mentoring, and access to
knowledge resources)?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating specifically with training and educational institutions to provide
subsidized and quality-compliant training capacity-building opportunities for innovators?

Is there an available repository of knowledge resources to provide to the innovators to enable
capacity building for scaling?

Are there mechanisms to incentivize communities to conduct localized training to enable collective
social networks?

Stories:

In Uganda, the innovators were provided training opportunities supported by Social
Innovation Academy, a civil society organization that provides capacity building and
training opportunities to disadvantaged innovators. A collaboration with the organization
enabled the innovators in the Uganda Accelerator Lab to envision greater scale

In South Africa, a conversation with a stakeholder, mLabs, a non-profit organization
supporting entrepreneurship, revealed a scalable mentorship model. For instance, a
CEO can temporarily join the team from a network of empaneled mentors to bridge gaps
and simultaneously train the team.

1.4.2. Access to Financial Resources

Several times during the research with Accelerator Labs was the issue raised of access to
financial resources. While this might be expected as a more or less routine requirement for
innovative activity, this is a crucial component that falls across various stages of innovation,
starting from resources for early testing to financial resources for scaling and ultimately
sustainability of successful interventions. Access to funding is thus a key challenge and a barrier
to experiment and scale. Successful social innovation and entrepreneurship reveals that creating
financial sustainability through innovative business or funding models are necessary conditions
in the process of scaling.14

14 Osberg and Martin 2015.

27

Objective: To identify resources that create financial sustainability for scaling of innovation

Recommendations:

1 Provide early training to innovators to identify and quantify their financial requirements to scale.

Provide a standardized, yet customizable financial model to support the innovators in developing
their financial requirements to scale, as a part of the early training.

Provide access to mentorship to encourage innovators to identify unique business models to enable
financial sustainability.

Provide workshops in collaboration with experts to train innovators in pitching innovations to
potential investors, or funds, or grants, to enable access to financial resources.

Onboard a formal network of stakeholders/partners to support funding requirements of innovators,
including early funding opportunities to pitches for larger investments.

Leverage government resources to support funding requirements of innovators, including early
funding opportunities to partnership opportunities for long term collaboration.

Create a portfolio of funding resources through strategic partnerships to enable easy access to
innovators.

Tag innovations under clusters or sectors. Tag funding opportunities under clusters or sectors.
Match the needs with opportunities.

Explore long-term and flexible funding opportunities such as collaborative finance. This includes
options of crowdsourcing funding for social innovation.

Guiding Questions:

1

Is there a fixed financial mapping model that can be used/adapted by innovators to understand their
financial needs to achieve the expected scale?

2

What are the financial requirements to scale a given social innovation?

3

4

5

Are there available workshops and resources that can enable innovators to think about innovative
and unique business models for financial sustainability?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with the government, both local and national, to leverage
funding opportunities for innovators?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with other stakeholders/partners (eg: private sector, civil society,
and incubators) to leverage funding opportunities for innovators?

28

8

Has the Accelerator Lab explored different models of financing for the innovations to scale (eg: debt,
equity, quasi-equity, convertible debt, hybrid)?

Is there an available repository of funding resources, including early grants, loan options,
partnerships, that innovators can have access to?

Does the Accelerator Lab have a portfolio of funding opportunities to facilitate scaling? Can the
innovation be clustered into a portfolio of innovations to match them to the categorized funding
opportunities?

Stories:

The Tanzania Accelerator Lab identifies that financial requirements are important to
scale innovation. Some measures that can help this include:
a) Setting up a platform to connect investors and innovators,
b) Analyzing if the requirements align with the SDGs,
c) Conducting a product-market analysis before investing resources to scale,
d) Mapping the innovations for easier connection with investors,
e) Analyzing if an innovation can be adopted into the UN portfolio.

The Zimbabwe Accelerator Lab suggested micro-financing options from the network,
including from stakeholders and partners to help small scale social innovators who have
limited access to funding opportunities.

1.4.3. Knowledge Repositories and Leveraging Data

Access to knowledge resources, reliable data analysis and its use in decision making, can inform
the scaling and support the direction of scale. Creating a knowledge repository and management
platform to collate, synthesize, and classify relevant reports, articles, videos, and podcasts for the
easy access of innovators can be useful in bringing knowledge gaps. This aspect is different from
the knowledge sharing in the Accelerator Labs Network and pertains mainly to external sources
of information. Providing access to trends to innovators through analysis of big data in
collaboration with strategic partners will ensure the innovators have access to macro trends that
can inform and improve decision making. These data sources are expensive and require training
to be able to synthesize but are fast transforming both the data universe and public policy
frameworks. Therefore, easy access through a dynamic and expanding knowledge repository
would benefit innovators.

29

Objective: To provide easy access to knowledge resources to innovators

Recommendations:

1

2

3

4

Collaborate with strategic partners, including academia, think tanks, and private sector, to develop
and catalogue knowledge resources.

Collate and catalogue resources relevant to scaling, including articles, videos, podcasts, reports,
and practical tools and worksheets.

Engage with strategic partners (e.g. mobile phone companies and social media actors) to identify
and leverage big data and macro-trends to develop ideas on issues to enable informed decision
making in the ecosystem.

Provide early training on use of the resources to innovators in the ecosystem to help them navigate
through the knowledge resources.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

3

Does the Accelerator Lab have any in-house knowledge resources to provide to innovators who join
the ecosystem?

Is the Accelerator Lab working with members in the supportive ecosystem to collate and catalogue
necessary knowledge resources that will be useful to scale social innovation?

Are the knowledge resources collated and catalogued for the easy access of innovators in the
network?

4 Are the knowledge resources in a form that can be easily shared with the innovators in the network?

5

Is the Accelerator Lab leveraging big data to capture trends and inform decision making to enable
scaling?

Stories:

The Serbia Accelerator Lab is looking at possible ways of acquiring and exploring new
data around migration. One of the new alternative data sources the Accelerator Lab is
using is data from LinkedIn. This data can provide more synthesized understanding as
to what job markets are hiring Serbians and contributing to the trend of outmigration.

1.4.4. Legal Aspects

Securing legal aspects to protect the innovation and the rights of social innovators is important to
incentivize and successfully scale social innovation. Innovation in local communities is rich and
an intangible asset. Therefore, securing them through legal aspects and policy frameworks would

30

propel the innovations to become assets that are sustainable and scalable.15 This Legal Aspects
component complements the Policy component in the Supportive Ecosystem section of the toolkit,
adding more practical details on preserving the rights of the innovators.

Objective: To secure the legal aspects and rights of innovators for scaling of innovation.

Recommendations:

1

Collaborate with strategic stakeholders/partners to identify the required legal aspects pertaining to
the innovation.

2 Conduct a workshop to help the innovators identify the legal aspects relevant to their innovation.

3 Develop an ownership model to incentivize innovators, while achieving ease of scale.

4

5

Collaborate with the government to develop institutional frameworks and policies to seamlessly
secure relevant legal aspects.

Identify the relevant legal aspects that have to be secured before a handover to a
stakeholder/partner.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

3

Has the Accelerator Lab identified legal requirements (e.g. registration of the enterprise, procuring
a certificate for operations) for scaling the innovation?

Does the Accelerators Lab have access to partners (e.g. legal experts, firms) to help innovators
identify and secure legal?

What are the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) applicable to the solution (e.g. patents, copyrights,
trademark, and Geographic Indicators (GI))?

4

Is the IPR of innovation secured?

5

Who owns the IPR of the innovation? Are there innovative ownership models to enable scaling of
innovation, while incentivizing innovators to share their innovations?

7 What are the legal aspects that should be secured for a handover to stakeholders/partners?

Stories:

On securing the legal aspects during a partnership, the Ecuador Accelerator Lab
suggested that signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or an Agreement with
the partner/stakeholder as a good practice. This would help in clearly defining the
expectations, obligations, and rights of each partner in scaling social innovations.

1.5. Learning from Scaling

This section specifies how Accelerator Labs, and the communities the Labs are working with, can
learn from the scaling effort individually and collectively. Whenever a new portfolio of solutions is
scaled, Accelerator Labs should be able to draw from the lessons of the last scaling phase. The
key elements to achieve this are:

● Resilience building to enable a culture of risk-taking and innovation (learning from failure).
● Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), as it helps understand what worked and what did not.
● Collective intelligence, as it expands Accelerator Labs learnings beyond the national context

and helps cross-fertilization across Labs.

● Scaling evidence, as it makes learning concrete, documented and potentially sharable.

1.5.1. Resilience Building and Learning from Failure

Failure is a part of the process of learning. Risk-taking and building resilience to failure is important
in enabling a culture of innovation.16 Particularly, in the process of social innovation, resilience
building becomes more important as the process of scaling is complex and requires the support
of many ecosystem players, increasing the aspect of risk. Accelerator Labs can encounter
challenging circumstances where an identified portfolio of solutions, despite early scaling
evidence, a supportive ecosystem, and sufficient resources, cannot be scaled out, up, or deep.
Therefore, to sustain a culture of innovation, while optimizing the use of resources, requires
practices that are lean, agile, and resilient to failure.

Objective: To learn from failure and build resilience into the culture of innovation

Recommendations:

1

2

3

Embrace failures as learning opportunities and as a natural part of the innovation process, while
taking necessary actions to increase probabilities of success.

Document the scaling journey across portfolios to identify reasons for why something went in an
unexpected direction during the scaling.

Create a culture of resilience through professional quality, confidence supported by activities such
as workshops and mentor conversations.

16 Farson and Keyes 2002.

32

Guiding Questions:

1

Does the Accelerator Lab have a process to document learning from the scaling of social
innovations?

2 Does the Accelerator Lab have an implementation map to identify the reasons/areas for failure?

3

4

Is the Accelerator Lab identifying, categorizing, and documenting reasons for failure/iteration (e.g.
negative impact on a vulnerable community, large infrastructural requirements, limited impact, lack
of a sustainable business model etc.)?

Does the Accelerator Lab have a process to identify if the reason for failure can be fixed rapidly
through iteration/stakeholder or partner support?

5

Is the Accelerator Lab engaging in activities to foster a culture of learning and resilience?

Stories:

As resilience to failure helps innovators navigate uncertainties of scaling social
innovation, Raizcorp, a business incubator that engages with the South Africa
Accelerator Lab, deploys a robust selection process, where “psychological assessment”
tools and comprehensive evaluation methods are used to identify an innovator’s ability
to be resilient to failure.

1.5.2. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

M&E plays a crucial role in the process of learning from scaling. Through monitoring, Accelerator
Labs can gather data and keep track of scaling. With regular evaluation on scaling, Accelerator
Labs are able to ensure solutions are scaled to reach their goal. Mechanisms of collecting and
documenting formal and informal evidence for monitoring and evaluation is crucial. Periodic
snapshots of scaling progress and discussion of evaluation results can keep Accelerator Labs
and stakeholders focused and engaged while facilitating corrections to the scaling process.17 M&E
tools help Accelerator Labs examine the innovation fidelity while accounting for adaptation in
various contexts within the local, national, regional, or global level. In addition, with proper
documentation and knowledge sharing, M&E results of each Accelerator Lab is able to provide
the whole Accelerator Labs Network and even the development field with successful experiences
and lessons learned.

17 Institute for Reproductive Health, Georgetown University. 2013.

33

Objective: To ensure the scaling is on the right way towards SDGs and addressing the needs of people

1

2

3

Plan for M&E of the portfolio at an early stage of the cycle. Integrate key resource requirements,
including human and financial resources and key stakeholder engagements, into the scaling plan.

Conduct monitoring and evaluation through both qualitative and quantitative analysis using existing
frameworks (e.g. Nesta’s Open Book of Social Innovation, which lists over twenty M&E methods).18

Develop effective support and implementation mechanisms to ensure the long-term success of
scaling any innovation. (e.g. engaging senior government bodies to support and instruct line
ministries, developing a diversified coalition of stakeholders with an aligned vision, and a clear value
proposition to ensure collective success).

Guiding Questions:

1 What are the indicators that the Accelerator Lab is using to measure the scaling?

● To what extent does the scaling contribute to address the need identified in the context of the SDGs?
● To what extent are the scaling goals achieved?
● Scaling out: How many individuals are benefited by the new solutions? What is the proportion of people

using the innovations and what is the feedback?

● Scaling deep: To what extent is it changing cultural norms?
● Scaling up: To what extent are policies and laws changed or impacted?
● To what extent have partners and stakeholders adopted the Accelerator Lab’s processes or service lines?
● To what extent has the UNDP Country Office adopted the Accelerator Lab’s processes or service lines?

2 What is the source of data for each indicator (e.g. a survey, a review, or administrative data)?

3 With what frequency will data be collected? What is the timeline for M&E?

4 Who is responsible for collecting the data, analysis and reporting?

5 What resources are needed to produce the data?

7

What are the risks and assumptions in carrying out the planned M&E activities? How will these risks
and assumptions affect the timing and quality of the data and of the indicators?

Stories:

With the authority to lead and accelerate government changes when needed, the Office
of Prime Minister in Uganda is the “custodian” of the SDGs and will monitor the line
ministries in their implementation. Having a senior government agency to ensure
implementation is key for long term sustainability.

34

1.5.3. Scaling Evidence

Many social innovators like BRAC or Teach First use formal and informal sources of evidence to
draw out and define their scaling models, which also helps to learn about the effectiveness of their
scaling model. Evidence can help make a case for the Lab’s scaling approach, for instance, as
part of stakeholder communication. Further, data-driven decision-making, a culture of sharing,
openness to learning, and the ability to look at context-specific as well as unusual indicators are
key success factors contributing to successful scaling. This component goes beyond M&E and
encourages the usage of formal and informal evidence as a base for scaling. The evidence
gathered is also important for the following component on building collective intelligence around
good practices among Accelerator Labs.

Objective: To facilitate evidence-based scaling

Recommendations:

1 Use formal evidence for the development of the scaling model and communication about it.

2 Use informal evidence as a complement or supplement.19

Guiding questions20:

1 Level 1: Can the Accelerator Lab describe what the vision for scaling is and why it matters?

2

Level 2: Can the Accelerator Lab capture data that shows positive change and can it be confirmed
that the Accelerator Lab contributed to this change?

3 Level 3: Can the Accelerator Lab demonstrate causality using a control and comparison group?

4

5

Level 4: Can the Accelerator Lab contribute to/facilitate/conduct evaluations that confirm the above
conclusions?

Level 5: Can the Accelerator Lab have manuals, systems, and procedures in place to ensure
consistent replication and positive impact?

1.5.4. Collective Intelligence of the Labs Network

This component contains different means to foster collective intelligence. As per Nesta, collective
intelligence “is created when people work together, often with the help of technology, to mobilise
a wider range of information, ideas and insights to address a social challenge” and “is a multiplier

19 It is important to note that formal evidence is not always fundamental to scaling social innovation. Stories and word-of-mouth recommendations can also be key. Stories can
be transmitted through different stakeholders and can be shared in-person or virtually

35

that brings new insights and ideas.”21 When conducting the survey with Accelerator Labs, most
Labs indicated that for scaling, knowledge sharing with the other Labs is key and support will be
needed to facilitate proper knowledge sharing. This component provides insights on how to build
collective intelligence around scaling within the Accelerator Labs Network. The component
builds on the Nesta collective intelligence design playbook and brings the key insights in to
Accelerator Labs’ context. The appendix of this report includes a more detailed table with
collective intelligence tools.

Objective: To leverage the intelligence created through Accelerator Labs Network and transform it into
collective learning

Recommendations:

1 Conduct a workshop with Accelerator Labs on collective intelligence.

2

Create spaces for exchange across Accelerator Labs, organized by the different service lines or
SDGs.

3 Mobilise data, knowledge and lessons learned from the Labs and share these continuously.

4

5

Encourage data collaboration practices with other Accelerator Labs (see Resources section for
more recommendations on Knowledge Repositories).

Take into consideration incentives for different stakeholders to be involved in building collective
intelligence.

6 Take into consideration data ethics22.

7

Reach out to Accelerator Labs in the network with similar challenges or contexts directly to gain
more in-depth knowledge beyond documented information.

Guiding questions:

1

2

3

Has the Accelerator Lab considered if other Accelerator Labs have done work on the same issues
that the Accelerator Lab is addressing?

How is the Accelerator Lab planning on making data/information produced available to other
Accelerator Labs?

Has the Accelerator Lab taken into consideration all relevant aspects of data ethics that apply to the
Accelerator Labs’ scaling process?

21 Peach and others 2019.
22 The data ethics worksheet from Nesta that is available here may help Accelerator Lab think about data ethics aspects of Accelerator Labs work.

36

Stories:

Many Accelerator Labs mentioned in the phone interviews that a targeted space for the
Accelerator Labs’ team members to exchange information with their colleagues is
needed to better gather and understand experiences and lessons learnt. Accelerator
Labs mentioned that this could come in the form of a simple, yet specialized, WhatsApp
group or a regular sub-group call session.

2. How to Use this Toolkit?

This section includes some suggestions on how Labs and their network can practically use the
Toolkit. It is intended to propose next steps for Labs to help guide them through the actual
implementation of recommendations. The table below is not exhaustive, and Labs are
encouraged to find context-specific ways of applying the report material. This table outlines some
ways this report can be utilized by Accelerator Labs.

Accelerator Labs can use this toolkit for:

1 Defining information needs around scaling social innovation and specifically looking up toolkit

components relevant to addressing those needs.

2 Building on the experimentation with innovative solutions and developing a country-specific scaling
strategy for a scalable portfolio of solutions drawing from the scaling framework and toolkit. This
could be facilitated through internal workshops or bootcamps.

3

Identifying relevant guiding questions and worksheets, and filling in answers as a team, potentially
involving stakeholders where applicable. A workshop could be conducted to clarify this practically.

4 Driving discussions around scaling with other Labs.

5 Conducting in-country stakeholder meetings, using relevant parts of the report as a tool to guide

discussions from envisioning scale to enhancing ownership.

4. Appendix: Tools for Collective Intelligence23

Tool

Implementation

Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches that source data, information,
opinions or ideas from large crowds of people, often by issuing open calls for contribution. It
can help bring new ideas or ideas from large crowds of people, often by issuing to light that
hadn’t previously been considered, or to gather expertise from people who have specialized
knowledge or understanding of an issue.

Crowd mapping

Crowd mapping is a type of crowdsourcing which media, text messages or geographic data,
to provide gathers data from different sources, including social real-time, interactive
information about issues on the ground. Crowd mapping can create detailed almost real-time
data in a way that a top-down, centrally curated, map may struggle to replicate.

Open data
repositories

A data repository would help the Labs and the HQ maintain an overview of the information
that is continuously produced on various channels such as the Medium blog and social media.
This repository should compile the different information channels and provide search options.
Further an additional dashboard such as available in Tableau could display the key new
information or disaggregate data by regions and SDGs.

Micro Survey

Micro Surveys are a short, abbreviated form of a few minutes to complete. Benefits include a
much faster turnaround, delivered by mobile phone, text message or a digital and higher
frequency of results, compared to traditional surveys. Micro Surveys can be conducted
through Google forms which provides the answers in the form of an excel sheet. Survey data
can be assessed through a codebook, similar to the one used for this research, as shown in
the appendix.

Wiki Survey

Wiki Surveys are a type of survey where participants can add statements that others respond
to. Participants’ statements are added to a pool and are then randomly presented back for
individual participants to respond to or rank. Over time, participants generate new ideas and
build a picture of where consensus or disagreement lies.

Wiki

An Accelerator Labs wiki would provide a collaborative web page with restricted access for
the Labs’ network. The wiki can be structured to enable multiple Labs to collaborate, share
knowledge and keep one another updated about key lessons learnt around scaling social
innovation.

Wiki data
warehouse

A wiki data warehouse is a central database which is optimized to analyze information coming
from a range of different sources, in this case the different Labs. The advantage is that
incoming data is cleaned, organized and structured in advance. It can be used for querying
and decision-making.

23 This is building on the Nesta Collective Intelligence Design Playbook, available here.
