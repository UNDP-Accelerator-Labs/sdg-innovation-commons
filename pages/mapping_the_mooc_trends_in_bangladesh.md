Student engagement in online learning, particularly via the massive open online courses (MOOCs) has been growing in Bangladesh, but data on the trends around it remains scarce. Little is known about the number of Bangladeshi users, their level of engagement and choices of subjects and types of micro-credentials for enrolments on the various micro-credential platforms like edX, Coursera, Udemy, Udacity etc. To address this gap, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab has begun an exploration series to better understand Bangladeshi user demographics and learning behaviour on the leading micro-credential providers. As a first step, the Accelerator Lab was granted data on Bangladeshi and Indian users by the edX platform and analysed the two countries' users on edX based on their gender, education levels, top enrolment by individual course, top enrolment by micro-credential, and most popular subjects pursued by learners.
