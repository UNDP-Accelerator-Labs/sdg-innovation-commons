## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Young people in Laos, even those with a degree from higher education, face challenges in accessing employment opportunities due to the lack of employability skills and limited jobs available.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As a country with one of the youngest populations in Asia-Pacific, the issue of youth unemployment has been a critical and continual concern for the government of Lao PDR. Despite implementing policies and undertaking projects to bolster job opportunities, disproportionately high youth unemployment remains a challenge.


With roughly 60% of the populace under the age of 25, the percentage of youth who are potentially employable, but out of work, hovers at 37%1. Add to that the recent Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to massive instability
in what were relatively stable employment situations for young people in service industries. Ideally, the given circumstances should compel Lao youth to adapt and search for work in other vocations, but limited skill sets and work experience, compounded with opaque hiring processes and scant access to higher status sectors, continues to leave the state of youth unemployment reeling.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We are using randomized controlled trials with the Job Assist Office to test whether current graduates and currently unemployed youth would have more chances to obtaining jobs if they are properly equipped with employability skills and are connected with potential employers. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In Lao PDR, the Accelerator Lab is testing whether current graduates and currently unemployed youth would have more chances to obtaining jobs if they are properly equipped with employability skills and are connected with potential employers through the Job Assist Office.

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Randomized Controlled Trails: to compare the results of treatment group and control groups for evidence-based results.
System  Thinking: to understand how each interventions connect with each other.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

If the testing of interventions succeeded, it could attract more collaboration from the government, especially Ministry of Education and sports and Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, other private companies and civil societies.
