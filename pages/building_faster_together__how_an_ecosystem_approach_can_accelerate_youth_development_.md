## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

What began as an exploration into how young people can be supported to develop relevant skills for the job market has expanded into an exploration of the Kenya Innovation Ecosystem and how its positioning and growth has contributed or not contributed to young people's skills development and its relevance therefore in shaping the future of work and business for young people. How did this happen? We began mapping out how young people were acquiring digital skills through a series of youth focused webinars. We then explored how exclusion had played a role in the ability of young people to take advantage of opportunities including learning and creative opportunities. In particular, we saw the lack of inclusion for persons with disability and informal sector workers and businesses playing a role in the resilience of these communities in the face of COVID-19. When most people were jumping on the digital train during the pandemic, many persons with disability and informal sector workers/businesses were left behind and this affected their recovery, resilience and innovative ability. The data we were collecting all pointed to a lacuna of information. For MSMEs for example, one of the notable and missing opportunities was a space to acquire digital skills in a language and format that was accessible and adaptable to their context. There was also lack of coordination and collaboration between counties and sectors that could be beneficial to the industry. This lack of coordination and structure extended to the broader business ecosystem. Simply put, there was little talking to each other by different stakeholders. Various interventions failed to address the dearth of information on who is doing what.  Kenya's digital economy is fast growing. The digital space is a relevant space for many sectors and industries. How might we learn faster about the different sector and population needs. The easy answer is together. By leveraging vantage points offered by the public and private sectors. In this we see the innovation ecosystem playing a significant role. Rapidly growing in an organic but also unstructured way, it has one unique vantage point- a digital economy strategy developed by the Government, the establishment of government agencies tasked with innovation development and the potential value of evolving data that could inform how business and job opportunities may be created for the future. That's our next big bet.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

A barrier that will continue  to shape out as we engage as an accelerator lab in the space of innovation in Kenya is that we are in a sea of many other actors. Kenya is unique in the sense that it really is a hub for partners, information and resources but the information flow can be challenging.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We wanted to be as user-centric as possible and understand the lived realities and challenges of the young people, persons with disability and informal sector workers. The gap is really the availability of disaggregated data per sector and county that would expose interested parties to the differentiated realities of youth in the different sectors and counties in Kenya. We for example do not have data on within the Agritech per county level. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Sense making was really critical to unpacking this challenge. We needed to engage various actors and players within the system to really establish the pain points and the gaps. Digital Inclusion is a broad subject with many players- to be relevant, we needed to sort through data and information to make sense of what/who was missing. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Riziki Source,  Action for Children with Disabilities Signs TV The Action Foundation Kytabu

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

MK Africa for the digital inclusion webinars

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of ICT Innovation and Youth Affairs

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The civil society partners were new. We engaged them through our Disability Inclusive Innovation Challenge where they were the finalists for the challenge. Thereafter we engaged in an extensive campaign to raise awareness for the need for inclusive innovation and the gaps that can be met by ensuring inclusive design. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the CO Transcending Peace Program for the Disability Inclusive Innovation work. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

N/A

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
