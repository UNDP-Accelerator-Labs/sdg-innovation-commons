The platform allows sharing the exact GPS coordinates in three common and unique words. Every 3x3-meter spot has its unique in most languages which helps remote businesses in the tourism sector, where addresses are often confusing or missing at all, ensure comfort in the navigation to their customers. 



Ukraine Lab is working with the National Tourism Agency to scale up the technology in Ukraine.
