(CNN) — Most of us get rid of old autos when their engines finally give up, but one man has turned his battered old VW Beetle into what he claims is the world's smallest hotel. And Mohammed Al Malaheem, 64, says guests sleeping in his converted jalopy in the Jordanian desert village of Al Jaya will enjoy a five-star experience. "This village is my homeland, I was born here, I grew up here, I lived here," says Al Malaheem -- who goes by the name Abu Ali. "I wanted to start a project that improves its situation and places it on the tourism map, because it truly overlooks some of the most beautiful scenery in the region." Largely deserted by residents who have left in search of a more modern lifestyle, Al Jaya is located near Al Shoubak, home to an imposing 12th century castle called Montreal.
