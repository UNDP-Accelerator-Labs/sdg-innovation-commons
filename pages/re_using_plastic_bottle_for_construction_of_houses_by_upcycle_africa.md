Plastic Bottle Constructions of houses as a means of Upcycling
Winner of the 2020 UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour award, Upcycle Africa upcycles plastic bottles by building houses.

There are over 150 Million Tonnes of Plastic already in the oceans. Every year, eight million tonnes of plastic waste end up in oceans and lakes. Experts predict that there will be more plastic than fish in oceans by 2050. And yet, the more waste we generate, the more waste we need to dispose off, but how? Plastic waste is not the only challenge we have in Uganda and Africa as a whole. Housing is still very expensive especially for people living in slums and low income areas. In Kampala, homes in slums are usually filled up with water when it rains, damaging property and making it difficult for people to live decently and yet, dignified housing is expensive considering that these families earn an average of $40 as monthly income.

Upcycle Africa protects the environment and promotes innovative mind-set while empowering youth. Through up-cycling plastic waste we train our local communities in Uganda especially the disadvantaged youth to protect the environment. Bottles replace environmentally unfriendly bricks, which are burnt for days promoting deforestation. Plastic bottles are collected and compacted with soil, making the houses very cost effective and affordable. Furthermore, the buildings are durable, buffer heat and are earthquake resistant. Upcycle Africa has constructed houses in different parts of Africa while creating employment opportunities for rural women and youths this has ensured economic empowerment for these women. These cash incentive allows low-income families to support their children with school fees. We also have a waste recovery system where we collect plastic waste from beaches, streets and bus stations ensuring clean and safe environments.
