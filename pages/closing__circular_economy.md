## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Lack of separation of waste at source and burning waste are inhibiting recycling and waste to energy initiatives  2. Several decades ago, developed cities like Yokohama faced similar waste management challenges to what Malawian cities are today. They addressed them through a portfolio of short-term and long-term interventions such as sensitisation of the public on appropriate household waste management and training schools on kids.  3. Production of low-quality compost manure is hindering adoption of the manure as an alternative to commercial inorganic fertilisers.  4. There are challenges with adoption and sustaining of household biogas digesters in rural communities where cow dung is used to generate biogas. This has led us to explore these factors under our energy frontier challenge instead of proceeding to test biogas digesters as a solution for waste in urban areas.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Disruptions in international procurement of equipment partly resulting from Covid-19 restrictions, delayed progress assembly of Internet of Things devices that are fitted to trash cans to detect and send alerts when a bin is full.  Changes of procurement modalities delayed engagement of a consultant to implement a call centre management information system.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Sensor and sensor network data: Internet of Things (IoT) devices with sensors detect level of waste in trash cans. Mobile phone data: Level of waste in trash cans is transmitted to a dashboard using 2G mobile network. Geospatial data: Location of the bin is recorded and sent to a dashboard for monitoring and management.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Participatory Design: waste management players (waste collectors, city councils, recyclers), who initially conceptualised mobile apps for waste, were involved in reviewing early prototypes and versions of the mobile apps. They feedback helped address design issues of the apps before deployment. Prototypes: Wireframes and early versions of the apps were presented to city councils and waste management players for their feedback. Pilots: Smart Trashcans have been piloted at 4 public institutions for early feedback and iterations.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

ICCM, Waste Advisers, mHub participated in the review of prototypes of mobile apps and in the webinar.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

University of Malawi developed mobile apps and implemented the smart trash can innovation. Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) co-designed a study to analyse and test and improve quality compost manure.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Private waste collectors: participated in the webinar on experiences from the Japanese City of Yokohama.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

City councils:   - Identified sites to test smart trashcans and facilitated their deployments  - Reviewed and tested prototypes and early versions the mobile apps  - Participated in the City of Yokohama webinar and helped in identifying participants from private sector and civil society.  Ministry of Local Government:  - Presented at the City of Yokohama waste management webinar 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

University of Malawi (as an implementing partner)
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By utilising skills from academia who are researching the soundwaves to calculate distance and programmed Internet of Things (IoT) devices to transmit this data to a dashboard, we have been able to automatically monitor levels of waste without traveling to the site of the waste bins.
