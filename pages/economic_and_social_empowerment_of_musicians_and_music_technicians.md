By establishing a community-oriented digital platform for all stakeholders, it is aimed to create meeting spaces within the scope of music and to create inclusive communities for every stage of production. Entrepreneurship, advocacy, technical training, community, sharing and networking opportunities and empowering employees for music production are also among the priority objectives.
