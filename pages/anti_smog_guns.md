> Type of the Solution

Design

> Affected Sector

Improve Air Quality

> Description of the solution

The guns work by spraying water vapor into the air, which absorbs the pollutants before falling to the ground like rain. the machine can help clear the dust and pollution particles from the environment and also reduce PM 10 and PM 2.5.

> Socio-economic effects

reduce pollution, prevent health risks

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- local government

> Timescale of implementation

- short-term (up to 1 year)

> Other Notes

While it doesn‚Äôt remove the contaminants entirely, it‚Äôs an effective short-term solution for smog-heavy days where breathing the air could present a severe health risk to residents.
