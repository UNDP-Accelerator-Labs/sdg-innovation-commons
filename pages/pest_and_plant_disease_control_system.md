> Title of the innovation

Pest and Plant Disease Control System

> Brief description of the innovation

The  Plant-Pest and Disease Control System is an initiative to help quickly and effectively curb plant diseases especially for farmers in rural areas.  Farmers will use the software by capturing an affected plant(s) or the pest affecting the plants. The system will then retrieve the possible name of the disease affecting the plant and the quickest possible solution. It will also provide a map of the nearest agro-dealers within that particular farmer's proximity that have the insecticide(s) for that particular pest/disease. Furthermore, it will have contacts for agriculture extension officers in their area for quick advice. Aside from this, it will incorporate local languages to make it more usable for farmers that would not be conversant with the English language. Daily tips on how to well manage crops (especially plant diversification) will also be available for farmers to ensure they are sustainable.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The PPDCS will generate income for agro-dealers that we will partner with as farmers will now easily and quickly find their shops. It will in a similar vain create income for me(us) as a percentage will be agreed upon with the agro-dealers for every farmer that locates them using our app from the sale of their products. It will improve the operations of the farmers as they will easily find solutions to their affected plants which aside from drought and floods is the major challenges farmers face in Zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

The system will be a mobile application built using Flutter so it can easily be accessed on all platforms i.e Android and IOS. The image processing will use google's TensorFlow together with Machine learning algorithms, specifically Python programming language. The Google Maps API will be used to show locations of nearby agro-dealer shops. The Google maps live location API will be used to give direction to the nearest agro-dealer shop in the farmer's area. So, when the farmer takes a picture of the affected plant(pest), the captured photo will be compared to the already existing pictures of the particular disease (pest) in the database using machine learning. After that, results will be displayed to the farmer showing the immediate remedies that can be used there and then and also the type of pesticide to use plus the agro-dealer shops that have that particular pesticide. It will then also show the "get direction" feature that will direct the farmer to their selected agro-dealers shop. Aside from this, a REST API will be created whose database will include information on how to prevent pest infections for plants. This then is where we will fetch the "Daily farmer tips" from.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will make plant disease control effective for farmers as they will be well informed through daily tips from the system. This will result in more plant harvests for farmers which reduces poverty, especially in rural areas. Farmers will have solutions to their plant diseases in the shortest period of time. The government through its extension officers will have quick access to information on particular plant diseases affecting certain parts of the country which will aid in faster intervention. For instance, in  Zambia in 2019, farmers lost their crops to armyworms as the government took time to intervene as a result of not knowing on time which parts of the country were affected. But with this system, such will be a thing of the past.
