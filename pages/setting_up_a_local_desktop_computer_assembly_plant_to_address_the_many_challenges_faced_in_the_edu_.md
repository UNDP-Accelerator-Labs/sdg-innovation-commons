Setting up a local Desktop Computer Assembly Plant to Address the many Challenges faced in the Education and Health sectors in Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Despite Government introducing Computer studies in the school curriculum, this has been a far-fetched dream to fully implement, as most of the learning institutions in Zambia lack fully equipped computer laboratories for both educators and leaners. Continuity of health care is also difficult due to lack of computers at health facilities, despite the introduction of SmartCare System, an electronic health record system, in health facilities. 

B-Technologies is an Innovative Computer Assembling and Service company which seek to engage in the purchasing of computer components, from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), assemble the desktop computers, rebrand, and supply them, mainly, in the Education and Health sectors. Also, B-Technologies will offer repair, maintenance, software installations and training of staff in basic computer repairs.

Our goal is to become one of the reliable and affordable source of, locally assembled, desktop computer suppliers and services in Zambia and have a reasonable market share for profit and income generation. Our Company seeks to employ individuals with high qualifications, self-motivated and able to meet the customer demands and standards professionally. 
At B-Technologies, our clients’ best interests will always come first and will be guided by our core values and professional ethics.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will directly bring in income by selling of locally assembled, branded desktop computers. The assembly plant will also offer warranty services on all supplied desktop computers.

Our main target market is the education and health sectors.
Computer usage in the education sector will improve quality of education and promote education equality.  Educators will be able to teach effectively using various computer aided programs. Also, learners will easily grasp concepts and lessons through different visual aids and presentations made possible by technology.

Most of the business communities have adopted computers in their business e.g., supermarkets, banks, wholesalers etc. Computers, easily, store vital information and records which can easily be accessed when needed for use. Computers have helped to employ professional qualified personnel thus giving them decent jobs.

Computers have provided better recorded keeping for patients through SmartCare System, the electronic health record system, and helped staff to consult and perform complicated procedures on patients. 

The challenge prize will enable us to establish a computer assembling plant and help us to create employment for the many young people. 

Widely use of computers will encourage green environment by reducing cutting down of trees for paper production.

> Technical Feasibility

Desktop computers will be assembled using components from sources where renowned Original Equipment Manufacturers get theirs. This should give an element of comfort to our clients or anyone who purchases our products. The product will be a Zambian product that will serve the market in Zambia, mainly. The assembly line will consist of Computer Science and Computer Engineering graduates.
The basic components/software needed to assemble a desktop computer includes but not limited to:
 Case,
 Motherboard,
 CPU,
 RAM,
 Storage Device,
 SATA data cables,
 Cooling (CPU and Chassis),
 PSU [Power Supply Unit],
 Display device, Monitor,
 Graphics cards,
 Operating System,
 Input Devices, Mouse, Keyboard, and
 Power cables,
Before starting to open components, safety will be considered by ensuring that the engineer is wearing a full personal protective equipment (PPE). 
The case will be prepared, and power supply installed first, components (processor and RAM) slotted on the motherboard then placed in the case. Install the CPU cooler and/or heatsink and graphic cards. Lastly, install the hard drive and connect other cables. Connect the display unit and the keyboard and mouse. Power on and install operating system and other essential application software. Power off, clean and box the desktop computer.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Everybody knows that this is the age of computers and vast majority of people are using computers. Assembling desktop computers in Zambia will improve access to computers in the education and health sector and at household level. This will positively impact delivery of education in line with computer studies subject, which was introduced in the Zambian education curriculum. Apart from using computers solely for computer education, computers have become essential for teaching other subjects.

Adding computers to the health care system brings one thing in mind, efficiency. Making available desktop computers in health institutions necessitates continuity of care through use of biometric scanners and or smart cards to access patient's electronic health records (EHR).

Locally assembled desktop computers will encourage introduction of decent jobs and contribute to the country's economy. With an increase in use of social media, a desktop computer is essential in every aspect of a business operation, including product creation, marketing, accounting, and administration.

International branded desktop computers are very expensive, for the local market, and after sale services are not enjoyed. Setting up a desktop assembly plant will change this narrative by offering brand new desktop computers and after sale services covered under warranty.
