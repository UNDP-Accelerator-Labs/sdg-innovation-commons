The village of Abaca is home to Fiji's national heritage park - Koroyanitu National Heritage Park and is site of attraction for tourists. The village is abundant in natural resources however farmers lack knowledge of sustainable organic practices and this is where the Foundation for Rural Integrated Enterprises & Development (FRIEND) have stepped in.
