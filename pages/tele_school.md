> Technical Feasibility

1.	Key Features 
-	Lessons
-	Lesson Exercises
-	Exam Quizzes 
-	Profile
-	Multiple users
2.	Service Development &amp; Tools
-	Development Technologies
The service’s required technology elements i.e. USSD &amp; SMS were simulated and tested. Megalphas has set up the simulation environment for the future changes and improvements, therefore giving us an advanced controlled and separated development and production environment.
-	Service Tools
The service has a web based dashboard to be used by system administrators and content providers for managing the service. The system administrators are responsible for managing content providers and managing other advanced service features. The content providers are responsible for managing (uploading/editing/deleting) the service content e.g. lessons, exam quiz etc.
-	Summary 
The application has a USSD part which is used for intended action selection (either take a lesson, answer exam quiz etc.) and an SMS part which is used for sending lesson notes, end of topic question and answers or exam questions and answers. We developed a web based dashboard which is used to manage the application.
3. Status Update
-	Our content in core subjects including English, Mathematics and the Sciences has been approved by the Ministry of Education's Curriculum Development Centre.
-	The application live testing was done (both USSD &amp; SMS part), using Savannah Communication Systems and their short code (*4499*123#). We have been working with Savannah Communications Limited to deploy the service on Zamtel. We are working on agreeing on the commercial agreement and activate the billing scripts.
