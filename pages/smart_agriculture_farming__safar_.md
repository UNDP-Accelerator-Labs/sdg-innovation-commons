The Smart Agriculture Farming (SAFAR) project functions to help mushroom growers use Industry 4.0 technology. With SAFAR, 60% of manual labour can be reduced, while increasing yield up to 30% more in grey oyster mushroom farming. SAFAR monitors temperature and humidity in the mushroom house, waters the mushroom in the morning and evening, and has other functions to aid in mushroom growing. The system can also be used for other vegetable farming.
