## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge faced by UNDP in Libya is to apply innovation tools such as the portfolio sensemaking approach to evaluate the current portfolio, gather strategic insights, support the newly established programme pillars and design a new Country Programme Document that is coherent, strategic, and relevant. As part of this process, the country office has established three new programme pillars and is seeking innovations to support these pillars. This involves gathering findings and insights about the current portfolio and turning them into actionable recommendations for the way forward. The goal is to strengthen the team's system thinking capabilities, enhance synergies among projects to create added value, and introduce the portfolio approach in UNDP Libya's programme. The report aims to provide a short overview of the process and its main elements, as well as capture the key insights and recommendations for the future.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenge faced by UNDP in Libya is rooted in the need to design a new Country Programme Document that is coherent, strategic, and relevant. The country office has established three new programme pillars and is seeking innovations to support these pillars. This process involves gathering findings and insights about the current portfolio and turning them into actionable recommendations for the way forward.


The current situation in Libya is complex and fluid, with ongoing political and security challenges. UNDP's work in the country aims to support stability, resilience, and development, and the portfolio sensemaking approach is intended to help the country office leadership and team take stock of UNDP's relevance, strategic positioning, partnerships, and programmatic offer in this context. The goal is to strengthen the team's system thinking capabilities, enhance synergies among projects to create added value, and introduce the portfolio approach in UNDP Libya's programme.


The UNDP Country Office in Libya is leading this process, with the support of the Global / Regional Innovation Team. Nearly 30 UNDP programme and project staff participated in a portfolio sensemaking workshop in February 2021, which was led by the senior leadership. Some of the recommendations that were developed as a result of this workshop will be implemented immediately, while others will be incorporated into the new Country Programme Document and implemented in the mid-term.


The desired outcome of this process is a more coherent, strategic, and relevant programme offer that can effectively address the challenges faced by the country and contribute to stability, resilience, and development. However, if the current situation is not effectively addressed, it may produce undesired effects such as a lack of progress on development goals, a decline in the effectiveness of UNDP's work, and a decrease in the organization's credibility and reputation.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is bringing a unique value proposition to the challenge faced by UNDP in Libya by applying the portfolio sensemaking approach and supporting the design of a new Country Programme Document that is coherent, strategic, and relevant. The Accelerator Lab brings expertise in innovation and a focus on rapid prototyping and testing, which can help the country office leadership and team gather findings and insights about the current portfolio and turn them into actionable recommendations for the way forward.


The Accelerator Lab is well-suited to work on this challenge because of its focus on supporting UNDP's work in countries around the world, and its ability to bring a fresh perspective and new approaches to addressing complex challenges. Additionally, the Accelerator Lab has a mandate to support the organization's efforts to be more agile, adaptive, and responsive, which is particularly important in the current context in Libya.


It is worth investing resources in this challenge because addressing the current situation and designing a new Country Programme Document that is coherent, strategic, and relevant can help UNDP achieve its goals in Libya, including supporting stability, resilience, and development. A more effective and relevant programme offer can also enhance the organization's credibility and reputation, and contribute to the overall effectiveness of UNDP's work.
