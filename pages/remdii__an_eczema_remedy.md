Dr Lai's child suffered from severe eczema and as she could not find a cure to ease his discomfort despite searching high and low. Her husband encouraged her on creating her own remedy.   Where eczema is concerned, the dermis layer is where allergens enter the skin causing the body's immune system to take over which would then cause the flare-ups. With her research rigor, she discovered and began to incorporate a very beneficial element called tocotrienol in her creams, something she noticed other available creams did not have. Even though its chemical properties may be hard to stabilise, and it is slightly more expensive, she knew that working with tocotrienol would be the way to move forward. She then founded Lipidware Sdn. Bhd. to produce Remdii creams. She has since filed two patents related to her research. Dr Lai with her colleagues have also created the Malaysian Eczema Support Community on Facebook, where it has reached Singaporean and even some European markets as well, proving that her Remdii products in combating skin conditions and eczema is a force to be reckoned with. This is not at all surprising since she has managed to help treat more than a thousand successful cases. Her creams, which have already reached an extraordinary level of success can be found in more than 500 pharmacies, 34 clinics and 2 hospitals in Malaysia. It has been very effective so much so she has even created other kinds of creams to suit a wide variety of needs.
