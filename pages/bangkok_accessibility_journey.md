- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To learn the challenge for people with disabilities on using public transportation in Bangkok

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If those who are at high level have have first-hand experience on public transportation and accessibility for PWDs, would they more be aware of the issue?

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Actions taken by organizations in charge to improve the accessibility in Bangkok

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

n/a

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation and narratives converted into video

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 weeks

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting links

More must be done for those with a disability (bangkokpost.com)

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Partnership with CSO, collaboration with several both ministerial and local government
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

If people have an experience like a PWD travelling in Bangkok, they will have more empathy on this issue and make a change.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

To make this quite low-profile

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 3,500 for video production

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We plan to work on a platform to identify the accessibility issue in Thailand

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

To the platform at national level

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Image/perception of the government is the most important priority for government officials. The issue of lack of sufficient accessibility provided by the government and local government is a sensitive issues. They would not like us to mentioned about their success but not problems.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Government considered pinpointing on the problem of accessibility for PWDs a sensitive issue which could ruin their reputation.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

We learn that data at hand is very important. Real-time or updated data accessibility and facility could be helpful for both PWDs and policy makers 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

CSO working on accessibility for the PWDs. Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. It should be iterated in different areas.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

An experiment should be conducted as low-profile as possible.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, it could be in any area where high-level people can learn about the hardship of people in the field.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The event was far more formal than expected. At first we planned that it will be informal one so that we could learn about the actual problem. However, once organizations learned that UNDP and the Embassy would do this, it became big issues for them with a lot of preparation.

> What surprised you?

Unexpected organizations i.e. district offices, municipal police, traffic police, showed up on the event day
