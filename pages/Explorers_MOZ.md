# Mozambique's Youth Employment Portfolio Initiative

### [[0:01]] Hey, how are you?

I'm fine\.

### [[0:05]] That's good\. So can you tell me your name and your position?

OK\. Good morning, everyone\. Julieta here from Mozambique, Head of Exploration\.

### [[0:14]] That's really nice\. So could you tell me about R&D and activity that you would like to share?

[[skills:Creativity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
Yes, I would like to talk about our portfolio, the one that I'm leaving with the Head of Unit governance, it's youth employment\. You want to know more details related, but we are doing or just a context first and then I will ask some follow up\. So what happens that Mozambique, it's a country that more than half of the population's youth, our RR, bring that beautiful initiative and this beautiful approach that you NDP is getting that we should not solve the problems of the world alone\. UNDP needs to work with other private sector, other UN entities so that we can address youth employment\. For me, it's good opportunity so that we can engage with different people and being different perspective\. And it's a hope for the Mozambican people to get better job and better conditions\. It's a beautiful way of addressing SDGS\.

### [[1:26]] That's great\. So, so who was involved in this?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Our club actually what's all team from our club is involved because we are supporting each other\. We have different Portifords, but we are supporting each other\. And what we have done is that we we've done a Ross to to invite other colleagues from the country if we wanted to join\. And we have a lot of people like maybe we are like 30 people\. And now we are in the initial phase that we are doing engagement peer\-to\-peer with the government\. So we have some institution like SASH and other other private edits that they want to join\. We're still in the first stage, but we hoping that we will have more people coming on board\. But inside of our country office, it's doing very well\. We have too much from different doing in debt will bring different perspective for us\.

### [[2:24]] That's fine\. So what will be your role?

[[tools:Portfolio approach]]
[[tools:Portfolio approach CPD]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[tools:Design]]
My role is like the dynamic person that is following following the, the the activities that they're going there\. But I don't mean my first like the dynamic person\. I'm, I'm doing everything I can\. I talk with the government, I bring ideas, I look for possible solutions, possible activities that we can do\. So I take, I can change my name and call myself the portfolio approach because I'm fascinated by the portfolio\. So I try to do everything that can add value for this approach that we are having\.

### [[3:04]] Perfect, perfect\. So can you tell me about some tools and methods that you use and why do you pick them?

[[tools:Portfolio approach]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
For example, to bring this approach of portfolio initiative? What I try to do is like peer\-to\-peer engagement with colleagues and explain to them the benefits for us to work as a portfolio with the government\. We are going to have a workshop, we'll do assets making because the idea is to go to the the people to Mozambican people and listen what they think\. What could be the solution that you need for us to address the problem? And there is like data collection the mapping that have done knowing like in Mozambique what are other activities related with youth that we current have and the which activities like successful stories that we have in place, what is going well and which could be the possible engage more possible units or private sector that you would like to call on board\. So we have done the mapping since making peer to put engagement data collection, yeah, basically\.

### [[4:11]] And we still bring more tools, but initial there are those ones that perfect and and what tactics do you use to engage?

### One of the, the tactics that I'm using too much is like bring emotional intelligence to the process because it's something new you need to have\. You need to be humble\. This process for me, it's working too much with emotional intelligence because I must be able to listen to people that you don't want to come and receive it well and call them to the next conversation where I'll address use another tactic\. So and I must show to them that they should use my shoes and see this with my perspective\. So emotional intelligence is my biggest tool that I'm using in big humble\. So in this kind of process where we have to deal and we have to invite people to take out to buy our idea, emotional intelligence is being one of my my secret to my secret ingredient for this process\.

### [[5:18]] So what what principles do you think is are important to guide this this R&D work?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
And what when I deal with the government, I must be honest, like I must not give hope that where there's no hope, I must show to the government this UNDP once of\. So I must put this thing to be more clear possible\. I mustn't put to them that I will be able to solve everything because it's not about UNDP, it's about everyone\. We are building a village and UNDP, it's a house\. So I have to show to them that we have to bring the other actors that will be part of the city\. So that's very important for me, the process to show that the process must be clear, everyone have the same opinion and we'll build this together\. That is one of the principles I have to be clear for all of them and how we will go in this beautiful journey\.

### \[6:26]] That's really nice, thank you\. And what about the skills that were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenges about?

[[tactics:Negotiation]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
[[tools:Design]]
So there is one strategist that I really like between our club is the the experiment\. The head of experimentation is the one who bring broadband solutions\. Like what you have done is a roast and then the roast we try to get from within the country of people from different areas\. So in this process like it's like we are preparing a food\. So we need the, the more spices that we can bring, the better\. So each people, they have different skills, they have different understanding\. So we are not looking for X specific skills, but we are looking for variety of skills because I have the background of being data analyst, being manager, the leadership\. But we have a, our colleague Alexandra that she's head of mapping that she's bring, she's very good in communicating partnership\. So we are trying to have the different kinds of expertise so that we can know how to address people and that will be very during the process because sometime we will need someone like from procurement that we are on the stage of hiring people\. So we try to make sure that we collected people from different areas and what was very interested in the time for people to reach Jesus\. We succeed with people from all the different from the government\. I believe that you will have different expertise because it's different institutions from the government that we are calling\. So we are working now with people that have like more knowledge about agenda\. Now we are going for people that were more expected related with youth and we want to try to get people with their like ICT innovation\. So we are trying to push as much as we can\.

### [[8:29]] That's great\. And reflecting on on the on the impacts or outcomes, why would U takes B?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So the impact that we expecting with this portfolio approach, it is not to solve of the problem for Mozambique, but is to create a very good foundation that can be sustainable\. We want to create a platform that we can address together problems of youth because if we can create a very good foundation and we can prove for our for other entities that they, they maybe they are not willing to join\. Now that it's possible\. I do believe that too much people they would want to join us when we will be replicating other province\. So now we we choose a very specific geographic location and there it will be the place where we are going to do our pilot\. If we can show and can build very good foundation that people can see the beauty of working in coordination\. For me, that is what we can call that success because from that we can escalate and you can call other agents to come and join UNDP and the government and this journey\.

### [[9:47]] Is there anything that you will do differently if you have the chance?

### Yes\. What I could do different from the process I knew the portfolio approach I could start that from the first day I started to work in UNDP because there's something I'm passionate about portfolio because of what there is too much institutions that they work in portfolio, but they don't know they work in portfolio\. There's portfolio inside of the organization, but UNDP's bring that approach of protocol that outside of UNDP, inside of UNDP, outside in NDP\. So I used to imagine my house, imagine if the countries, the presidents of the counts, they would use this approach even to solve political issues, even to solve any kind of problem, even in families like take it more outside of everything they think about families\. And when you have an issue, if you can call cousins, if you can call and much as possible people come in with different expertise to solve a problem\. You wouldn't take like years and you can gain, you can gain time because people they will bring experience, failure, success\. And you see that your journey would be more easy\. So I could use this part of approach from the first day I started work on UNDP if I knew it before\.

### [[11:05]] That's great\. So tell me a little bit about the strategies that you use about the fusion and adoption of this\.

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
And Andy, one of the strategies is like being hassle when we, when we addressing the government and when we want to share what we have, sometimes we have to behave like you don't have anything to share to give space to them\. We don't appear like you are the one who know more, but you call them and say, let's think together\. What could be the solution? We have these\. Do you think that this is the better way of present this? What platforms you use? So we try to to take their platforms and show to them that you what you have, it is available, but we can use it\. What do you think of this way We are doing so our ways of showing what we have share expertise or showing our final product is to give government opportunity for them to feel like they are the owner of this and give and ask to them\. We have these\. How do you think that we should share to whom? But we already have the answers, but we want them to have the ownership\. So that's one of the strategy that we use when you want to to show to diffuse our job\. But from now we are we are hiring someone that will work with communication because we have seen that that is something that we want to be like other UNS\. You want to explore more because we have beautiful jobs within our country offense and we want to show to the world what we are doing, but we don't want to show along\. We want to create a platform\. Already we are dealing with the government\. We are doing the platform where we can have information like innovation, anything related with UNDP world and with the government together\. So the idea is to make this job, this platform more something that is more from the government, because if the government feels on ship, they will, they will leverage it for other people\.

### [[13:15]] Perfect\. That's that's really, really great\. Thank you\. Thank you for sharing\.
