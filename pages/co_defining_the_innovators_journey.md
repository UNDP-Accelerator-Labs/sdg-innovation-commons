## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. About 78% of innovators supported by the AccLab initiatives have reported moving from at least one stage of development to the next with the majority 48% reported having moved from prototype stage to research and development stage. This shows us that the initiatives have been helpful and are bridging the gap in the Innovation journey.  2. There were no females who self-reported to be at commercialization stage, the number of females led innovations reduce the further along the development stage, while the same trends are also observed amongst the male led innovations the proportion of women remains smaller- There is need for more deliberate efforts to support women led innovations. 3.  Innovators further suggested that as most programmes target at ideation 25% then followed by fully commercial product at 23% while prototype and pre commercialization stood at 18% with research and development put at 16%, Further AccLab intervention is further required in these areas, notwithstanding the role of Government, Academia and other hubs in strengthening the innovation environment and ecosystem through providing support by providing technical support , financial support, and creating linkages. Therefore UNDP – AccLab should consider revising their level of involvement at the ideation stage. 4. AccLab could further invest in a modern online Management Information System that will be used to track all the innovators that have participated in any of the UNDP AccLab initiatives. 5. UNDP should also consider linking the local innovators to the other countries AccLab innovators and experts to have cross learning and motivation”. 6. Intellectual property issue.  Zambian innovators have been supported to further their idea, prototypes etc., enhancing their visibility without guarantee of protection of their intellectual property worldwide - there is a need to tap into the AccLab Network for a solution to support the protection of Zambian Innovations

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, for example. 1. Engagement Modalities with Partners and Innovators- These are at times take too long.  2. Funding Windows: Available funding windows are too short to continuously support and monitor innovators effectively. 3. Working in Silos, Coordination and Regulation of stakeholders in the eco system

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The project data was used during the literature review stage of data collection to gain an understanding of different, innovation initiative models (past and ongoing), This also helped us triangulate comparable innovation initiatives that could be included in the study. Focus group discussion, in depth interviews formed part of the co creation methods used to collect information to co design an innovation journey pathway. Lastly survey data was used to collect quantitative data on Innovation initiative beneficiaries to understand the impact of participating in innovation challenges on their innovation pathways. The data methods were used to fill gaps in existing qualitative and quantitative data about the innovation ecosystem and impact analysis of different initiatives and models that have been used in Zambia.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Part of the design for data collection involved focus group discussions to co design the innovation journey pathway further the information collected from the key informant interviews with key stakeholders within the ecosystem helped define the innovator journey based on their experience working on different innovation initiatives within the ecosystem some of which were AccLab initiatives therefore the methods listed above were most relevant to be applied.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Jacaranda Hub, WEAC, Bongo Hive, Impact Hub- They participated in the in-depth interviews.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Copperbelt University, National Institute for Scientific and Industrial Research- Our academic partners have been our key experimentation partners and have provided R&D support to innovators under the Experimentation Programme, they also participated in the in-depth interviews.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

PKF- Business Development Training to the waste management innovators and Innovators

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Technology and Science- Policy and Enabling Environment- we have worked with the Ministry to support Innovation Policy Review and development of the innovation policy strategy, National Technology Business Centre- Key partner under the National Innovation Initiative (NII) scouting and supporting innovators across the country with business development skills and commercialization support. Both participated in the in-depth interviews.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNFPA- partnered on the National Innovation Initiative (2021) to source and support maternal health centered innovations- participated in the in-depth interviews.
