In the Darién region, specifically in the communities of Canaán and Bajo Chiquito, the massive migration across the Colombia-Panama border has significantly transformed local life. These communities, located along the path of thousands of migrants traveling through the dense jungle on their way north, have had to adapt to a constant flow of people.Throughout this journey, new social and economic dynamics have emerged, impacting both residents and the migrant population. This brief blog explores the complex relationships between host communities and migrants, the management of natural resources, emerging tensions, and the challenges and opportunities arising from this phenomenon.

These insights are part of this Public Policy Note, within the framework of the initiative “Peaceful Coexistence and Social Cohesion for Local Development of Host Communities in Bajo Chiquito and Canaán in the Emberá-Wounaan Territory," part of the InfoSegura Regional Project between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which focuses on the formulation and implementation of public policies on citizen security and justice in Central America and the Dominican Republic.Open Doors, But With Limits: Hospitality in Times of Transit In most cases, according to interviews, workshops, and conversations during visits, no significant cases of hostility or major issues were observed or reported between the local population and the migrant population. There exists a relationship in which the host community provides services and the migrants mostly pay for these services. There are also cases of solidarity, primarily towards women, girls, and children, where community members provide food, shelter, and guidance without expecting payment in return.

Improvised shelters for incoming migrants, Canaán community. Another example of observed solidarity is the time migrants spend in the community. Both Canaán and Bajo Chiquito have an internal policy of not allowing any migrant to stay in the community for more than one night.All migrants must depart the day after they arrive on local wooden boats (similar to canoes or dugouts) to the Temporary Migrant Reception Stations (ETRM) awaiting them “downstream” in Lajas Blancas, if they come from Bajo Chiquito, or in San Vicente if they come from Canaán. This also applies to those without the financial resources to pay for transportation, as each boat carries at least one or two people traveling for free; women, men, children, and sick individuals are also prioritized.Through interviews, workshops, and community observation, there is a general perception of a relatively peaceful coexistence in Canaán and Bajo Chiquito, where there is a friendly relationship between locals and migrants.All interviewed residents of both communities affirmed: “We have no problems with the migrants.” However, there is tension with "outsiders," people who visit to conduct business and create a sense of insecurity among locals. “The atmosphere is calm; they all come with good intentions, wanting to continue their journey. We don't have the capacity to properly receive everyone, but we provide good support,” commented a resident of Bajo Chiquito.

Downstream: Tensions Floating on the Water In Canaán, there is greater tension with downstream communities, including Mach Pöbor, Sinaí, and Alto Playona, related to agreements on the logistical management of the migrant population traveling on the river. The Dos Bocas point is the first place migrants reach after walking more than two days through the jungle from Carreto, heading to Canaán.This point is controlled by residents of other communities and outsiders who profit economically from the migrants before transporting them to Canaán, a practice that was prohibited under the agreement between communities. The Canaán community is seeking support from territorial authorities to address this issue through dialogue before it escalates.On the other hand, the Bajo Chiquito community has better communication and coordination with neighboring communities (Marragantí, Nuevo Vigía, and Villa Caleta), with which they have agreements and assigned days to take turns providing canoe services and transporting migrants to Lajas BlancasUnder the Shadows of Plastic: Environmental Pollution Challenges Problems related to solid waste and human waste pose serious public health threats. The accumulation of solid waste (mainly plastic and foam) can create breeding grounds for vectors such as flies, mosquitoes, and rodents that transmit diseases like dengue and malaria. Additionally, water and soil pollution from this waste is already affecting the river, which is the primary water source for these communities.In Canaán and Bajo Chiquito, most residents clean their yards and burn their trash on-site, exposing them to the toxic smoke generated by burning plastic in the open air. Furthermore, the lack of wastewater treatment leads to the inadequate disposal of liquid waste, which flows down pathways or makeshift channels into the river, further exacerbating pollution

To address these issues, both communities have established Cleaning Committees, coordinated by the local congress, responsible for daily cleaning, filling water tanks, and waste management, serving as an example of effective local management. However, the lack of adequate sanitation facilities, especially for migrants, presents an additional challenge that urgently needs to be addressed to protect the health and well-being of all residents in these communities.The Other Shift: From Agriculture to WiFi Before the arrival of migrants, both communities relied mainly on subsistence agriculture and hunting. Since the influx of migrants began in 2010, there has been improved access to healthcare, a considerable boost to the local economy, and support from government organizations and institutions compared to neighboring communities. Interviewees and participants in some community workshops noted a "radical" change with the arrival of migrants.Traditional homes have been replaced by cement houses with zinc roofs (galvanized sheets). Businesses and sales have increased, with numerous WiFi stations ($2 per hour) providing internet as the only communication option via Starlink satellite internet since there is currentlyno mobile coverage or telephone network in the area, nor is there an electrical grid—everything runs on solar panels.

It is worth noting that most interviewees in both communities are aware of the situation migrants face and show empathy: “We’re tired, but it has to be done. When they arrive [from the jungle], they look for food; we have to give them what they need.”Silencing Celebrations: When Security Redefines TraditionIn Bajo Chiquito, a significant community change occurred in 2018, when the local congress decided that, for security reasons related to the migrants, the community could no longer hold community celebrations.On the other hand, the community values the cultural exchange with the migrant population and the opportunity to learn about the histories of their countries, new languages, food, and different traditions. Overall, residents agree that they have learned to treat people, visitors, and migrants better.

The Role of Women and Youth in Times of Change In Canaán and Bajo Chiquito, women have taken on a more visible role in the local economy. Many women, both young and old, run food, lodging, and WiFi businesses, which has given them greater economic independence and empowerment.However, it is essential to better understand how these changes might impact gender-based violence at home. Teenage pregnancy rates are high; the Emberá-Wounaan Territory has a fertility rate of 50% among women under 20 (MIDES, 2023). Leaders in Bajo Chiquito and Canaán have requested specialized training for women in leadership and empowerment, as well as first aid, to better support migrant women.Youth face a unique situation. Many young people have dropped out of school due to increased economic opportunities, primarily in the canoe transport business. However, there is an awareness of the need to continue their education, especially in agriculture, to maintain stability if migration ceases to be a source of income.However, opinions are mixed about the increased income and other aspects of community life. A young resident of Canaán expressed, “My family is tired of the garbage, constant noise, and having the river dirty,” highlighting that the changes have not only been economic but also environmental, with negative impacts, and cultural.Looking Ahead: A Balance Between Solidarity and Survival The communities of Canaán and Bajo Chiquito have managed to coexist peacefully with the migrant population, showing solidarity and generating economic opportunities, while also facing new challenges. Despite tensions with some neighboring communities and the environmental impact caused by migrant transit, both communities have shown remarkable adaptability.In the face of this enormous challenge, these communities in Bajo Chiquito and Canaán have demonstrated resilience, knowledge, and collective actions that are crucial to incorporate into the humanitarian response and a long-term development vision. It is also essential to deepen the identified fundamental starting points, adopting a strategic and forward-looking approach to local development that expands the discussion beyond the current crisis towards the design of new scenarios built on the biological, cultural, and historical diversity of this globally significant region.
