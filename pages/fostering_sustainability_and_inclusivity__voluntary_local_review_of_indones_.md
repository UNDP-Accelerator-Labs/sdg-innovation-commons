> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The new capital city of Indonesia, named Nusantara, is envisaged to be a green, smart, inclusive, resilient and sustainable city. Among the efforts of the Indonesian government to realise this vision is by enacting the Nusantara Voluntary Local Review (VLR), to track the city’s commitment to the SDGs and the 2030 agenda, as well as ensure that the capital city is consistent to its vision. The concept of VLR holds significant potential in bridging the gap between local actions and the global discourse on sustainable development. 

VLR has proven useful for cities and regions to foster the localization of SDGs and demonstrate their capacity and commitments towards the 2030 agenda. It is seen as an effective tool for monitoring progress at the subnational level as they take local context into consideration in setting goals and targets, as well as in determining indicators for measuring and monitoring progress through localization.  

The VLR is conducted in two districts comprising the Nusantara area which are Penajam Paser Utara Regency and Kutai Kartanegara Regency in East Kalimantan Province. Usually, the VLR is enacted in well-established regions, so the analysis performed is ex-post analysis. However, since Nusantara is still in the development process, the VLR will be carried out with ex-ante analysis. Therefore, our remaining challenge is how the VLR can predict the impacts of Nusantara’s development in the achievement of SDGs by 2030.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



A VLR acts as a unifying exercise at the local level that serves as a model for comprehensive bottom-up action to achieve the SDGs. Conducting a VLR helps spread awareness on the SDGs with local communities and accelerates their uptake across all municipal departments, strengthening horizontal and vertical coordination between them, as well as more informed decision making.  

UNDP Indonesia, through the UNDP Accelerator Lab team, as an agile entity within the UNDP network, plays a pivotal role in connecting grassroots communities, local innovative social enterprises, and government stakeholders. This localized approach aligns with the broader objectives of sustainable development, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and inclusivity. In 2023, UNDP signed an MoU with the Nusantara Capital City Authority (OIKN), focusing on building joint initiatives for inclusive development, with an intent to strengthen the new national capital’s eight main principles. 

The VLR Nusantara Baseline study has been started in 2023, and in February 2024, the IKN Authority published the Nusantara VLR SDGs Baseline, covering the early stage of VLR process. The VLR Baseline is conducted in two districts comprising the Nusantara area which are Penajam Paser Utara Regency and Kutai Kartanegara Regency in East Kalimantan Province. The baseline VLR shows that the Nusantara area has been performing well in several indicators, such as electrification ratio and birth registration. [1] 

This baseline is used as to measure the current progress of areas of Nusantara in achieving the SDGs. It is used as a basis to track the progression of the SDGs’ implementation progress by 2030 in Nusantara and ensure that the capital city is consistent to its vision. UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab, together with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and Padjadjaran University supports the development of VLRs for the Nusantara.

The Nusantara VLR Baseline describes the baseline conditions of the Eastern of Kalimantan on achieving SDGs target before Nusantara exists. The baseline helps the Nusantara Capital Authority (OIKN) to understand the current challenges in the region in achieving SDG’s while also allowing to monitor any changes in SDGs achievement as Nusantara develops. The baseline report shows that the regions are performing well on several aspects, such as access to basic services, clean water and affordable housing. [1]

VLR is a self-assessment conducted by local governments to track their progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. Guided by the SDGs principles of inclusivity, the right to livable communities, and multi-stakeholder engagement, VLR serves as a critical first step in mobilizing action to address interconnected crises and drive sustainable urban development. 

The VLR will support Indonesia’s commitment to implement the SDGs as mandated in the Presidential Regulation 59/2017 concerning Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals Achievement. The UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2021-2025 also articulates the UN’s collective actions to support Indonesia in preserving and accelerating the achievements of SDGs. Through a multi-stakeholder consultation process, the UNSDCF is aligned with the Government’s National Medium-Term Development Plan 2020-2024, with four strategic priorities (inclusive human development; economic transformation; green development, climate change and natural disasters; and Innovation) to accelerate the progress towards the SDGs.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



UNDP Indonesia, through the UNDP Accelerator Lab team, as an agile entity within the UNDP network, plays a pivotal role in connecting grassroots communities, local innovative social enterprises, and government stakeholders. Positioned strategically, the team facilitates a dynamic exchange between these entities, creating an ecosystem that is responsive to local needs and challenges. This localized approach aligns with the broader objectives of sustainable development, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and inclusivity. In 2023, UNDP signed an MoU with the Nusantara Capital City Authority (OIKN), focusing on building joint initiatives for inclusive development, with an intent to strengthen the new national capital’s eight main principles. 

VLR holds significant potential in bridging the gap between local actions and the global discourse on sustainable development. In essence, the collaboration between the UNDP Accelerator Lab and the VLR initiatives strengthens the local-to-global linkage envisioned in the 2030 Agenda. By working together, these can create a more inclusive and impactful approach to sustainable development, ensuring that the global discourse is informed by the realities and aspirations of the communities at the grassroots level. UNDP Indonesia stands ready to support and strengthen collaboration with the OIKN.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The Nusantara VLR measures the implementation of 12 goals of SDGs in the regions (SDG 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16 and 17). Since Nusantara is still in the development process, the VLR will be carried out with ex-ante analysis, which is different from VLR in general that uses the ex-post analysis.  

More specifically, it takes inspiration from foresight methodology, which manifests in mixed methods research, integrating both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Being a future capital city, Nusantara presents a perfect sandbox to test foresight approaches.  

The quantitative study is conducted by analysing the gap between the prediction of SDGs’ targets achievement without Nusantara’s development (as the baseline) and with Nusantara’s development in East Kalimantan by 2030. The baseline is calculated using trend analysis from the current data obtained from the National Statistics Agency. Meanwhile, the calculation of SDGs’ achievements with the development of IKN by 2030 is carried out using simulation modelling.  

In relation to the qualitative method, the data collection is conducted through a participatory process involving the local communities through FGD and workshop. This step is necessary to provide insights from the locals in order to ensure that the research accurately reflects the realities of the community being studied, improving the validity and reliability of research findings. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The focus of the study is to predict whether the new capital city’s development bring positive impacts to accelerate the achievement of SDGs in the region and therefore improve the local communities’ wellbeing. The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods in the VLR will provide a comprehensive understanding and explore the complexity of the issues at hand, thorough assessment of the current progress, as well as to enhance the validity and credibility of the findings.

VLR study in the development of Indonesia's new capital city is crucial to measure the current progress and ensure that the development plan is on track to achieve the vision of Nusantara as a green, smart, inclusive, resilient and sustainable city. The current VLR is still conducted within the borders of Nusantara area, which are the Penajam Paser Utara regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency in East Kalimantan. The areas of improvement will be expanding this initiative beyond the boundaries of the new capital city to encompass the neighbourhood regions, as they are also impacted by the development of the new capital city. This could involve collaborating with local governments and stakeholders in neighbouring provinces to conduct VLRs tailored to their specific contexts and development priorities. By doing this, the authorities will have a holistic development perspective of the socio-economic, environmental, and governance dynamics in the broader area surrounding the new capital city, which is beneficial for a more integrated approach to development planning and decision-making.
