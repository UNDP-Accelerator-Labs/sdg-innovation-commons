> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

There are vulnerable communities that lack public lighting, which causes problems such as insecurity, lack of community social cohesion, theft of animals, among others. By implementing light poles that work with solar energy, access routes to communities and recreational places such as parks, schools, community houses are illuminated. This initiative also brings internet to communities, and the solution is being explored.
