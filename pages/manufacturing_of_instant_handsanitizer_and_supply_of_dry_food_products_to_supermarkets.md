> Title of the innovation

Manufacturing of instant Handsanitizer and Supply of dry food products to supermarkets

> Brief description of the innovation

Manufacturing of Handsanitizer and Supply of dry food products have both been tested and found to be marketable as well as profitable.With insertion of more capital it can be a source of employment for many.Our Handsanitizer has been tested and approved by Zabs and we have already supplied 3330 bottles of 400mls to the government under CEEC despite the fact that we borrowed at an abnormally high interest rate to deliver the project so it didn't help our small company as much as it could have.As for our dry foods, they have also proved to be marketable for we have already supplied four supermarkets before, having one of the supermarkets ordering almost every week.
We surely have market for our products, what we need is monetory boost.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Going with Handsanitizers to school has become a rule for most schools.As for dry foods, they are less of them in supermarkets and most of the people who buy from supermarkets don't have time to go to the markets.Handsanizers will foster a disease free society, while our nutritious food products will also support good human health.

> Technical Feasibility

With Handsanitizers,we plan to target schools and other public places while with dry foods will target supermarkets where there is less competition for these needed foods..

> Anticipated Social Impact

Both inovations will foster prevention of disease,one by killing germs,the other by providing much needed nutrition.It can also be a source of employment
