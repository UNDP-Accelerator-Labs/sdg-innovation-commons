> Description of the solution

A Boston Professor Yi Zheng created an invention that reflects the heat off the rooftops and even sucks the heat out of homes and buildings-and it is 100% recyclable. Yi Zhing created the 'Cooling Paper' so that a building or home could essentially keep cool on its own, with no electricity required. The paper can cool down a room¬¥s temperature by using as much as 10 degrees Fahreinheit. Zheng's invention works through the porous microstructure of the natural fibers inside cooling paper which absorbs warmth and re-emits it way from the building. The cooling paper is part of Zheng's nanomaterials studies. The heat comes out through the building as infrared radiation and is taken up by the cooling paper, where it is emitted at wavelengths not absorbed by the atmosphere.
