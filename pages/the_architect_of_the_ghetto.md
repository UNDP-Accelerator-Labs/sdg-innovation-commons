Alpha Oumar, since childhood began to create gadgets such as carts, helicopters, shoes, planes and other pure to name a few ...  During its development, it was several times confronted with the problems of funding and supervision which were a real obstacle. One of Alpha Oumar's strengths was that in a dream he was used to visions that he forced himself to implement. He succeeded but still with a few points to review such as taking measurements to properly frame his work. It was therefore necessary for him to follow a training in masonry to understand how to overcome this obstacle. This is how he began to produce models of all kinds, here in image that of a double stadium sports complex with covered roofs. Added to this is his developed sense of adaptability to various trades such as hairdressing, electronics, particularly the repair of mobile phones and other accessories, and finally the carpentry where his action consists of indicating to laborers how to model and assemble what 'he wants to complete for a clientele whose orders are made on the basis of negotiation with regard to the final design to be adopted. Diallo Alpha Oumar would like the government to make available for young people in Guinea, and particularly those from Boké, a center intended to support young people in their businesses. According to him, these centers could be equipped with minimum equipment that could guarantee the development of the spirit of creativity.
