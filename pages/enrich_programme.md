Through the ENRICH program, women from different communities in rural areas of Guatemala are trained to use a tablet, smartphone or LED TV to communicate and share content that can be useful to them and their communities.  


For women who have been denied the opportunity to receive a formal education, the Enriche curriculum puts at their disposal a democratic learning environment, barrier-free and inclusive of their many skills and wisdom.
