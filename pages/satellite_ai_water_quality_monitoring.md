The project uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence for automated analysis and constant monitoring of physical, chemical, and biological parameters such as:

• Surface temperature
• Turbidity
• Dissolved oxygen
• Chlorophyll-a
• Total nitrogen
• Total phosphorus




Solutions that help companies, communities, and governments in making informed decisions for the proper management of water resources of continental and oceanic aquatic ecosystems in various sectors such as:

• Fisheries

• Marine ecosystems

• Blue Carbon


• Oil &amp; Gas

• Water Quality

• Coastal Engineering

• Aquaculture
