> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Litumba Enterprises began as a hobby by Wamuwi Imasiku and John Nabitha two years ago. Over the last two years they have worked out all of the bugs related to production. Additionally, they are now quite hungry to succeed in creating one of the premier of good plant for biofuel production farm in the country. The team also plan to hire about 10 farm workers which include two farm Specialists and a driver. To finance our growth and full-time production, we need to purchase $10,000 worth of new equipment as long-term assets. To that end, Litumba Enterpises is seeking a $30,000 capital. The Sales forecasts conservatively indicate that $50,000 revenue will be generated in year two, rising to $100,000 the following year. Litumba Enterprises has identified three main customer groups: supplement companies; biofuel processors; and Supermarkets. The customer segments are distinct enough to be able to target each one differently. The industry that Litumba Enterprises produces for has been undergoing consolidation for several years now. Litumba Enterprises will be able to serve the industry by leveraging their competitive edge of healthy, potent crops.

> Technical Feasibility

The marketing strategy will have the objective of raising awareness and visibility of their industry-leading percentages of active botanical plants. The strategy will communicate the fact that botanial plants will yield a significantly higher amount of botanicals measured per plant. 
The sales strategy, in addition to reinforcing the competitive edge, will seek to qualify leads by concentrating on Botanical Bounty's ability to perform reliably on long-term contracts, becoming a stable supplier to the larger companies that need a steady supply stream.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Litumba Enterprises will benefit from growing Caster oil. The value chain for Caster Oil is diverse and gives Litumba Enterprises many options. Benefits are primarily income, but can also be saved costs. The most significant income comes from sale of seeds, oil or soap. Which Substitutes expensive fertilizer and other fuels are significant in terms of saved costs? Cash is needed in the rural households for transportation, school fees and school materials, medicine, clothes and paraffin. Another aspect is health: Some households use diesel for lighting. Diesel creates smoke which smells badly, irritates and pollutes indoor air quality. Secondary benefits are oil for lighting, cooking or fuel, fertilizer, charcoal from the press cake. The wide and various value chains, give castor oil farmer a wide range of multiple choices. It is also import to bear in mind the yield stability. Caster Seed and Irish potato are also drought resistant. The growing of Irish potato and caster seed can somehow be at the cost of food production.
