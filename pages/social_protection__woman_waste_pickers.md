## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The intent of the experiment is to generate knowledge regarding the impact of behavioral insights to tackle cognitive biases towards recycling.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF users get personalized messages that respond to their cognitive biases towards recycling, THEN they will recycle more and better. IF users increase their recycling volume, THEN waste pickers will see an increse in their income.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

By using the ReciVeci app personalized push notifications & emails will be sent based on what material users recycle more: plastic, cardboard, paper, metal or tetrapak.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of citizens that changed their behaviour regarding recycling

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data collection process will be done by the data generated by the app.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 to 6 months.

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis was proven. The number of users and kilograms were aumented due to the introduction of push notifications.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

None, the methodology proved to be adequate for its purpose

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

5 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Over USD 15.000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Tentatively the app (reci veci) could be improved with IA to foster better results regarding reciclying.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not at the moment

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1.- With proper motivation and constant reminders, citizens are more prone to recicle 2.- The quantity and quality of their reciclyng can be improved with the use of digital tools

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacle was to adapt the experiment to the COVID pandemic

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Environment team could use the results to foster strategies regarding recycling and circular economy

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Woman waste pickers Citizens that need to recycle / want to learn about recycling Reci Veci

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, the main iteration had to do with adapting the experiment to COVID-19 pandemic

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Focus on the outreach of the tool to generate robust data gathering 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

It could be replicated on other SDGs: gender equality, decent work, climatec action.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

NA

> What surprised you?

The capacity of shape behaviour by the use of technologies, regarding reciclyn, which seem to far fetched to achieve, first hand
