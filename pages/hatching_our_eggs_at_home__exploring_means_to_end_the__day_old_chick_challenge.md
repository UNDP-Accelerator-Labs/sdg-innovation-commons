## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To conduct the maiden test of a locally built hatchery for poultry eggs to understand how it works and its demands 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If poultry hatcheries can be built in-country then this will reduce national dependency on  the importation of day-old chicks to maintain production cycle

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The prototype will be built with funding from UNDP and newly hatched poultry eggs will be introduced into the unit for hatching and results analysed

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters measured: Environmental condition, Maintenance frequency

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Temperature and humidity within the unit, battery life,

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes it was proven that though the unit took the normal 21 days to complete the hatching process yet still because of the increased capacity of the hatchery to accommodate more eggs then turnover increased

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I had little knowledge about the entire process but because we engaged sector experts the process went on smoothly 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

little over 7 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

2,500

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Expand the scope of the experiment in collaboration with FAO, Ministry of Agriculture and Poultry Association. We intend to build  between 5 to 10 of these unit and distribute them to small scale poultry farmers to use over a period of 2 - 4 hatching cycles and we analyse data submitted that can be the final stage of this experiment that would advise on next steps.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1. Poultry meat is the second highest protein source for Sierra Leone 2. There is no functioning incubator in-country and this situation has been the normal for more than 10 years.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Internal delays in engaging the innovator, processing payments etc. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Sustainable Local Economic Development Cluster as this team works to promote youth empowerment & employment and fund start-ups with eco friendly solutions

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

SL Poultry Association have been monitoring the experiment process closely as individual small scale farmers have over the years bought small capacity hatcheries but could not maintain them and therefore reverted to importation of day-old chicks and its related costs + risks

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

1 iteration was experienced that relates to external design of the unit
