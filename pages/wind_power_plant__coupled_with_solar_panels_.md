> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

No

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The purpose of the project is to create hybrid (wind and solar) renewable energy system  that will have significantly increased efficiency (+30 % for wind turbine and 2x for solar panels) compared to conventional systems. Three innovations are used in the system: 
Wind turbine - Patent # GE U 2020 2043; Author - Alexander Moseshvili, 
Solar Cells with Concentrator (CPV) - Patent # US 6,481,859 B1; Author - Aleksandre Moseshvili; The innovation is the winner of the global innovation competition and has been issued with a certificate of entry into global markets and financing (Helsinki 2011) and  
Composite Lens - patent # GE P 2009 4588 B; Author - Alexander Moseshvili.

Prototypes of all three innovations have been created and tested;
in addition to high efficiency, our system is also characterized by ecological benefits (it does not emit low-frequency sounds harmful to living organisms and does not cause migration of birds).

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- IP protected

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

1200 USD for 500W. The capacity of the device can be scaled, cost will be increased proportionally.

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

TRL 8

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

N/A

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback
N/A

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

According to our calculations, it will generate electricity 1.5 times cheaper than conventional devices.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

After the establishment of the factory and the development of the distribution direction, there will be no obstacles.
