Qualitative online research that aims to determine all the factors that influence behavior and personal action during a pandemic. The research will identify the factors that are responsible for someone to cope better with the current situation. As predictors in the research, the team examines the attitude towards various protection measures and institutions, the assessment of the danger of the virus, the fear of losing a job or a reduction in salary, etc. The research is conducted by a team of psychologists from the College of Vocational Studies in Subotica and the EU employment agency "Interea" from Novi Sad. The research is already in the process of implementation.
