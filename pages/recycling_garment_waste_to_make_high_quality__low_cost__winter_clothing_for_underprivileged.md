## What is the challenge?

Access to warm cloth including blanket is a major challenge in the northern districts of Bangladesh. Many people can’t afford quality blankets and as a result, suffer throughout the winter. To address this challenge, Shorobor’s Warmth in Winter team used to distribute blankets in the winter in northern districts of Bangladesh. They usually would buy blankets from the local markets and distribute them. However, the blankets they used to buy didn’t give enough warmth and were of low quality.
## What is the solution?

As a result, the Shorobor Warmth in Winter team was looking for blankets that would give warmth and at the same time would be cheap. After much searching, they found some blankets produced in Bogra/Sirajganj called ‘Jor Kombol’ made from RMG waste ‘jhut kapor’. But those blankets didn’t last long. To address the challenge, Shorobor’s Warmth in Winter team decided to produce high quality but low cost blankets in house using the garments waste. They did R&amp;D with the blankets the locals produce and discovered that using a high quality yarn to sew the cloth fragments makes the blankets last longer. They also brought some changes in the way those fragment cloths were sewed so that it doesn't tear down easily. These products are:

Cost effective: Very low cost blankets for the poor of the North of Bangladesh.

Good Quality: It effectively warms poor people in the cold.

Environment friendly as it recycles RMG waste.

After producing the blankets, they established a new concept of social business. Now Shorobor Warmth in Winter makes high quality affordable blankets, shawl, hoodie from RMG waste and distributes them to poor and underprivileged people in need across the country.

Warmth in Winter now works using a distinct model. It has two customer segments:

Corporate, defined as those who buy for their own use or use their own distribution channels like different humanitarian organizations to distribute these blankets to people in need.

Retail, defined as those who buy from Shorobor’s Warmth in Winter but gives Warmth in Winter the responsibility of distributing the blankets. Shorobor’s Warmth in Winter has developed an extensive ground network by which it identifies and lists poor people in different districts. Then it delivers the blankets bought by its customers to those poor people. It has created this alternative distribution mechanism to ensure that people who deserve these blankets get them. It then provides its customers' names, addresses and pictures of the receivers of the blankets.
