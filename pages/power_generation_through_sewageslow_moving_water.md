> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

There is a worldwide search for solutions that harness alternate energy sources to generate energy. Balakrishna has developed a system that generates energy from slow-moving sewage or any other source of flowing water when it is passed through a cylindrical drum. The helical blades inside the cylindrical drum provide the spam for rotation in generating power. The capacity of the existing pilot unit is 30 KVA as claimed by the innovator. This technology can have a tremendous impact on the generation of power from low velocity, high volume discharge of effluents from industries and civil sewage processing plants in cities and industrial estates. NIF has facilitated the preliminary assessment of the technology by interested agencies and entrepreneurs, from India and abroad.
