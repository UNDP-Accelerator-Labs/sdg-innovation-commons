> Title of the innovation

ZAMBIA READS or  zamreads, was born 24 years ago but was only named 2 years ago.its a dream to get every Zambian an ability to read very early in life. I have invested many years in research through interview, attending trainings that earned me a diploma and and teaching for over 15 years. The more I research, the more I am confident that it is possible to give quality education at a very minimal cost.

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia reads has the following goals
1) to get every Zambian to read and love reading
2) to get parents actively involved in children's success in education
3) train community school teachers to offer the very best of education to the marginalized
4)create employment and career opportunities to youths
We recognise the massive number of students graduating from primary school unable to read. Zambia reads will get a child reading by third grade using phonics and syllables. Our education system is mostly in a classroom. Zambia reads will take it to homes and families to eliminate barriers such as distance, cost and accord a child a personal tutor  available at their convenience. Community school teacher are left without support to complement their efforts. Zambia read will train and affiliate them to our library with access to more than 1500 books. 
We shall transform 2000 lives in 2022 in kalikiliki compounds by  training and empowering 100 parents and 50 community school teacher. Each parent will handle a minimum of 3 kids while teachers will handle 30 students each.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will generate income by a fee that parents and teachers will pay to receive the training and library affiliation fee for a whole year. Members of the community will pay library affiliation  fee because everyone will need to use it. Teachers in community schools will increase confidence for themselves and  schools, which will translate into more income. Some may even open their own schools and employ others too. Existing businesses such as business centers will increase sells due to a number of paper work to be completed.

> Technical Feasibility

Every one stands to benefit from our project. In three months we enrol and train 150  tutors( teachers and parents) 100 parents and 50 teachers. Each parent teaches 3 students and teachers will impact 30 each. This will result in 1800 lives transformed in the first year and then graduating the same number every three months because we will have a new group of coaches every three months. Resulting in 600 coaches trained a year. These will be supported by Zambia reads with the curriculum, technical support reading materials and assessment tools for a whole year at a once off cost of only k350 each.  parents  who had no literacy skill will be able to read. The impact of lock down on education will be reduced and the cost of education will be very law.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Communication will be improved. Families will bond. Youths will be motivated to study because they are able to read.  Chances of employment will rise for most people. More income to improve livelihood. Reduce corona virus cases. Early educational skills for kids. Information sharing will increase. Innovation will be the order of the day. Self esteem improved and most importantly Zambia will read with love.
