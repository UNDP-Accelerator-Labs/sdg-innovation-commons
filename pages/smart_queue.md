> Title of the innovation

Smart Queue

> Brief description of the innovation

This software is an online Queue Management System that can be used at business institutions such as Banks, Hospitals, Schools, and government offices that deal with lines of people on a daily basis. Customers join queues using their smartphone, and when their token has been called they receive an SMS. Each customer can monitor how the queue is moving on their phone.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Smart Queue is sold in copies, organizations pay a monthly fee at each branch that the software is installed. Smart Queue increases customer satisfaction as clients do not need to stand in a physical line, unlike being in a line for hours, the app gives customers a chance to run other errands while monitoring the queue on the go. Every organization wants its clients to tell a good story about them, and Smart Queue is designed for that. The target market includes Banks, Hospitals, Universities, and Government Offices that deal with lines of people on a daily basis. The prize money will be used to launch a marketing campaign and to design a mobile application.

> Technical Feasibility

Smart Queue is available as a web application currently. Future plans are to design mobile applications for both Android and iOS. The software is fully functional and we're in the process of customer acquisition.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By allowing customers to monitor queues while on the move, SMART QUEUE promotes Social Distancing as customers do not need to over crowd in one place.  Social Distancing is one of the 5 golden rules that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced organizations to adopt the new normal of life and they must do everything possible to protect the lives of their customers.  Smart Queue also helps customers to save on time by allowing them to run other errands as they are constantly updated on their position in the queue.
