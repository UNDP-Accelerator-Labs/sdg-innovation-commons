No

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Despite the external similarities with other vertical gardens, this construction has two innovative features, due to which it is the cheapest and most energy-efficient in the world - it reduces greenhouse heating costs by  4-5 times. This innovation is recognized by world-class experts. This project won two international competitions - IDEANCO and Launch Fort Harvesting Challenge. This construction has two know-hows: 

1. The phytoblocks used to build the vertical farm have such a shape that they do not need a steel frame. Blocks hold each other. Only support poles are necessary, the rolls can also be made of plastic or with minimal metal reinforcement every 3-5 meters. This reduces the construction costs by 2-3 times, because the most expensive part of the construction is the steel frame, not the plastic blocks. 

2. The shape of the blocks ensures the uniformity of the soil in the entire volume of the vertical farm. This makes it possible to grow not only greens and lettuce, but also vegetables that are difficult to grow in conventional vertical hydroponics - eggplant, bell pepper, etc. Because they have a genetic need to have a large volume of roots. In this way, the yield per square meter increases 4-5 times and, accordingly, the cost of heating the greenhouses is also reduced, because if the mentioned vegetables are planted in one layer on the soil in a normal greenhouse, 4-5 layers of phytoblocks will be placed on the same area in a vertical farm.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- IP protected

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

The cost of one phyto-block is 10 GEL on average, its filling with soil also costs about 10 GEL, and installation costs 2 GEL. Transportation depends on the distance and the maximum cost per unit in the territory of Georgia will be 1 GEL. Training will be provided for free.

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

TRL 9

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

This solution has already been diffused among several municipalities and some farmers are interested in it.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Yes

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

No
