HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
INDEX 2022 – NORTH MACEDONIA

Pathway through
uncertain times

Introduction – what is Human Development
Index and how does North Macedonia rank

related

The Human Development Report (hereon
HDR), based on its quantitative methodological
fundament – the Human Development Index
(hereon HDI), is one of the longest-standing
and most comprehensive tools for data-
gathering, analysis, and policy assessment in
the field of human development. Published by
the United Nations Development Programme
(hereon UNDP), the HDR is being published
continuously for more than three decades.1
With
its comprehensive and voluminous
database from almost all countries in the
World, it is an investigative instrument under
the auspices of the UN system ever since
1990. The analytical scope of the HDR entails
vital political, social, economic, and cultural
topics
to human development.
The HDR is based on the HDI which is a
complex index i.e., “a summary measure of
average achievement in key dimensions of
human development: a long and healthy life,
being knowledgeable and have a decent
standard of living” being a “geometric mean
of normalized indices for each of the three
dimensions” (UNDP, HDR 2021/22). The first,
health aspect of the HDI is based on average
(normalized
life expectancy per country
measure) while
the educational aspect
contains two measures – expected years of
schooling and mean years of schooling –
values that are normalized and their simple
mean is being calculated. The third aspect,
the Gross National Income (GNI) is measured
through Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) per
the standard
represents
country which
measure for average income per country.
Finally, the HDI measures the difference
between GNI per capita rank minus HDI
rank indicating the disparity between simple

economic standard of a country compared to
its human development level.

development globally, and country by country.
It displays the level of progress in achieving a
desired human standard of living in vital areas
such as education, longevity of human life
and economic development. For the general
public, the HDI is a general waypoint of human
progress of country in the mentioned areas,
but also an indicator of global occurrences in
human development. On these lines, one of the
most persistent trends of the HDI globally, ever
since its beginning in 1990, was the permanent
increase in its value, indicating permanent
rise in human development on a global scale.
However, this rather durable trend started to
gradually change in 2019, even before the
outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning
that a gradual downward development has
been detected. The outbreak of the Covid-19
pandemic
in 2020 only aggravated and
accelerated this trend, with 2021 being the first
year where HDI is measured and decreasing
in value for two years consecutively. What
is worse, the 2021 value of the index on a
global level (0,732)2 is lower that the value of
the index in 2017 (0,733) which has canceled
out five-year efforts of permanent improving.
Such a development implies that the highest
level of the HDI (0,739), set in 2019, will be met
only if the trend starts shifting and gradually
improving, which is hard to predict given the
latest developments in 2022 globally and
especially in Europe. Even if so, it will take an
uncertain period of time until the 2019 level is
reached once again.

The ranking of North Macedonia in the HDR
did not commence as soon as quantitative
data started to be collected for the needs
of the Report in 1990. Longitudinal data
indicates that North Macedonia has been
present in the rankings since 2000, and ever
since, the value trend of the HDI follows the
developments in the global values of the
HDI. North Macedonia is placed in the group
of countries with high human development
(second best cohort)3. The broader picture
of the last two decades reveals that the
progress of North Macedonia has been more
rapid in the 2000-2010 period - 0, 90%,
compared to the 2010-2021 period with only
0, 36% increase of the HDI value. A stable

and gradual increase in the HDI occurred in
period between 2000 and 2019, increasing
the value of the index from 0,675 to 0,784
(UNDP, HDI 2021/22 Source Data). This
trend started declining in 2020, as for most
of the countries ranked in the HDI, dropping
to 0,774 in 2020 and further plunging in
2021 to 0,770. This places the HDI of North
Macedonia lower than the value achieved in
2018 (0,779) and close to the value of 2015
(0,762) meaning that at least four years of
progress have been lost with the latest shift in
the value of the index. If the trend continues
in the following year(s) the number of years of
lost progress in the HDI might rise to seven
or higher.

³ Countries are generally divided into four cohorts – 1) very high human development (Switzerland, Norway, Iceland etc.); 2)
high human development – (Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia); 3) medium human development (Phillipines, Botswana,
Bolivia etc.); and 4) low human development (Tanzania, Pakistan, Togo etc.). Please see HDR 2021/22 Statistical Annex.

Analyzing the region of Southeast Europe
in perspective, indications are that North
Macedonia is behind the countries in the
region, although statistical differences are not
big. More specifically, both longitudinal and
values of the HDI 2021/22 indicate that North
Macedonia holds a place behind all other
countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Bulgaria,

Greece, and Albania. Five countries of the
Southeast Europe cohort are placed in
the group of countries with very high HDI
(Slovenia, Greece, Croatia, Montenegro,
and Serbia) while four are in the group of
countries with high HDI (Albania, Bulgaria,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and North
Macedonia).

On the positive side, the increase in the
percent of growth of the HDI in both
decades (2000-2010 and 2010-2021) is one
of the biggest in the region, exceeded only
by Serbia and Albania in both time series,
joined by Croatia but only in the second
decade; although in general the differences
in the growth of the HDI are rather minimal
in between compared countries
in the
given time series. Nevertheless, the latest
downward spiral in the value of the HDI
for the last two years will probably disturb
the previously established patterns and
create new ones, which should be analyzed
from a time perspective of several years.
Nevertheless, the general trend in the HDI
is not merely a statistical indicator that
displays a decreasing trend – it is also a

cumulative marker that needs to be analyzed
from several perspectives. One of those
perspectives concerns good governance
and political stability, since both are
prerequisites for a stable and prosperous
society that could create preconditions for
human development and progress in all
other fields. Without political stability and
good governance, it is hard to achieve or
even discuss other matters that contribute
to human development and progress. Lack
of good governance and political stability
regularly leads to uncertainty in societies
that are subject to the lack thereof, which
also
(UNDP,
HDR 2021/11) causing a vicious circle
of more
lack of governance
and uncertainty.

Political Stability and
Good Governance

The last two decades have been marked
by a series of crises commencing with the
financial crisis of 2007, the migrant crisis
after the conflict in Syria in 2015-2016, the
energetic crisis of global level, the outbreak
of the Covid-19 pandemic and continuing
with the Ukrainian conflict in 2022. Even
more so, there was an overlap between the
Covid-19 pandemic crisis and the Ukrainian
conflict, while the pandemic has not been
declared as formally over by the World
Health Organization. In such circumstances, it
comes as no surprise that the HDI is globally
declining two years consecutively, although
the decline started prior to the outbreak.
What
is worse, the Covid-19 pandemic
initiated a massive democratic backsliding
in many countries throughout the world,
with Governments and hybrid/authoritarian
regimes either misusing measures or
implementing measures that were clearly
beyond the scope of health protection of the
population (Edgell et al. 2021, V-Dem 2022).
The region of Southeast Europe was no
exception to this general rule, with respective
differences between countries (Brandlë et al.,
2020). Democratic backsliding occurred in
many countries globally but also in the region
of Southeast Europe due to the overuse of
measures aimed at combating Covid-19 such
as lockdowns and other forms of government
interventionism
implemented
that were
in the direction of control of political and
social processes rather than combating the
pandemic itself (Lewkowicz et al. 2022). Data
indicate that transitional countries and hybrid
regimes are far more vulnerable to such
democratic drawbacks, usually resulting in
breaches of human rights, and undermining

of the rule of law and institutional balance of
societies for the sake of attaining powerful
political instruments for control of society. On
these lines, the HDI 2021/22 data supports the
general perception of insecurity among the
population, especially in the most developed
countries (UNDP, HDI 2021/22 Source Data)
joined by peaking negative views about the
world and increasing perception of adverse
effects from the crisis globally.

the

societal

In such an atmosphere, it seems that North
Macedonia’s resilience towards democratic
backsliding is not founded on firm grounds
given
trends emanating
resilience
itself. On one hand, North
Macedonia is one of the worst performers
in OECD’s PISA tests in the region (OECD,
2018), accompanied by the lowest score in
the Media Literacy Index (Lessenski, 2021)
out of all countries in Europe. With a score
of only 15 points North Macedonia is last on
the list, with Finland as the leading country
with a score of 76, five times higher than
North Macedonia. An additional undermining
effect that enables democratic backsliding
is related to the general perception of
corruption
(Transparency
the country
International, 2021), where the HDR 2021/22
clearly displayed the link between corruption
and poor governance as determinants of
lower economic growth, investment, and
tax revenue. North Macedonia has an index
of 39 (out of 100) ranking 87 out of 180
countries in 2021. Although North Macedonia
has had a slight improvement in the last year,
the widespread perception of corruption
contributes to poor governance and the
possibility for democratic backsliding.

If one takes into consideration that these
indicators are joined by a relatively high
inclination towards demand for populism and
belief in conspiracy theories (Bliznakovski
et al. 2021), it becomes clear that North
Macedonia has a very weak defense system
against democratic threats and hazards, with
a population that is generally not sufficiently
informed to recognize the very sources of
such threats and hazards.

With limited prerequisites for maintaining the
democratic capacity of the society, it comes
as no surprise that the Covid-19 outbreak
came as a very serious test, not just for
the institutions of the Macedonian political

system but also to the society in general.
The findings of the HDR 2021/22 were
generally supported by findings of local and
international organizations working in North
Macedonia. Namely, data of the International
Republican Institute (2021) indicate that at the
end of 2021 there is widespread pessimism
in the country on the future economic
situation in the country, negative perception
on the rule of law and lack of trust, especially
towards political parties. An opinion poll by
the National Democratic Institute from 2021
gives supporting evidence related to lack of
trust in political institutions, but also on the
general distrust in democracy as the best
suited model for the local political setup.

North Macedonia’s democratic
indicators
have been relatively steady in the last two
decades related to the lack of trust towards
the institution of the country (UNDP, Early
Warning Report 2005), as well as in social
polarization over the preferred system of rule
– democracy or authoritarianism (Freedom
House, NiT– North Macedonia 2017). On one
hand, the Early Warning Report of UNDP,
as early as 2005, indicated that there is
serious lack of trust in political leaders and
institutions, a trend that is more or less steady
until present, joined with a general perception
of the country moving in the wrong direction.
On the other hand, Freedom House has been
warning on gradual democratic backsliding in
North Macedonia ever since 2011 (democracy
and individual category scores), with the
report in 2017 clearly indicating the duality
of the system – declared democracy with

Dissatisfaction
in democracy, stimulated
by the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19
crisis, further acerbated negative trends,
with majority of the population believing
that Western type democracy is not best
suited for the local political system. Even
more so, institutional trust remains relatively
low, with the population mostly expressing
its satisfaction

Least favored are the political parties and
the Judiciary, and of all political institutions
the President is perceived as the most

In the context of functioning of democratic
institutions, it is important to draw attention

how much the government response to
Covid-19 was gender sensitive. As data of
the Global Covid Gender Response Tracker
indicate (2020), North Macedonia has had an
average of 44% of gender sensitive measures
overall, which is above the Western Balkan
average and among the better scores in the
region. However, as a recent study of UN
Women (2021) indicates “the design of the
crisis measures and policies to deal with the
COVID-19 pandemic (but also in any case
of emergency) should have been based
on a gender analysis and assessment of
the potential effect of these measures and
policies on men and women as well as in terms
of improving gender equality. Furthermore,
more consideration should have been given
to the inter-sectorial approach that allows
for the identification of vulnerable groups
based on multiple factors such as gender
but also encompasses, among others, class,
employment status, the rural/urban divide,

ethnicity, and the size of the household.”

indicated
(Papcunová and Gregánová 2021; OECD

on municipal revenues (2020) indicate an
identical situation whereas “municipal own-

half of 2020 compared to the same period in
2019”, while “the share of intergovernmental
grants rose to 69.8% to compensate for the
loss in municipal revenue.” The trend of
uncertainty continued with the commencing
of the crisis in Ukraine building on the
already manifested vulnerabilities of the
municipalities in North Macedonia.

The Covid-19 Crisis and Its Impact on
North Macedonia (General and
Socio-Economic Indicators)

The detrimental effect of the Covid-19
pandemic on quality of democracy and
general perceptions of political and
economic insecurity originated from the
very beginnings of the crisis in March 2020.
Ever since the beginning of the pandemic
outbreak in North Macedonia, the mortality
rate from Covid-19 placed the country among
the group of countries that could have
invested more efforts in treating Covid-19

registering mortality

patients. Notwithstanding, methodologies
for
from Covid-19
differed from country to country; but by
the end of the pandemic, North Macedonia
is placed fifth worldwide in mortality rates
per 100 000 population with an average of
458,68 deaths (John Hopkins University of
Medicine, 2022). It was ranked better only
compared to Peru, Bulgaria, Hungary and
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The feeling of uncertainty prompted by the
Covid-19 pandemic deteriorated further with
the spillover of the crisis into the business
segment of society. As expected,
the
measures undertaken to combat the spread
of the disease reflected on the enterprises
in the country that underwent one of the
hardest periods for their survival. Lockdowns,
breakages in supply chains, the inability to
travel for the largest part of the population
globally, absence of workforce (Amirudin
et al. 2021) etc. only increased the already

laborious position of Macedonian enterprises
in the local context. As data comprised by the
International Labor Organization (hereinafter
ILO) indicate that most of the enterprises
experienced a significant drop in revenue
in the period October-December 2020, with
the biggest damages (20-40% loss) reported
by medium and
large enterprises). The
situation is no better with micro enterprises,
where 28% reported a decrease of 20-40%,
and almost a quarter of them (24%) reported
a dramatic decrease in revenue of over 60%.

The domino effect of the crisis reflected
on the workforce of the enterprises and
the labor market in the country, whereas
most of the surveyed companies reported
a significant
in dismissals of
workforce. More than half of the companies

(over 41%) occurred in 3% of the companies.
The number of unemployed persons
skyrocketed in the first six months of the
pandemic where “between February 29th
and September 30th, 2020, 45,543 persons
were registered as newly unemployed on a
net basis” which was “a 43.0% increase of
the total number of registered unemployed
persons in seven months” (UNDP, SACINM
2020). The implications of the job dismissals
directly affected the perceptions of the active
population on the labor market, creating
additional uncertainty among jobseekers but
also among vast part of the already employed
population.

The negative socio-economic trends were
additionally strengthened by the increasing
food prices, which is an indicator with a
steady growth ever since 2005 (UNDP,
SACINM 2020). However, after the start of
the pandemic food prices registered their
highest annual growth of 5,5% in June 2020
with “domestic prices of food experienced
a less steep trend during the pandemic”.
Accompanied with the constantly rising
prices of other living costs such as housing,
water, electricity, gas etc. a socio-economic
vortex of uncertainty was created leaving its
footprint in areas such as gender relations
and social polarization in society as well.
On one hand, the effects of the Covid-19

pandemic crisis heightened the tensions in
all societies worldwide and have put forward
political animosities and social polarization,
with rising extremism and use of violent
means for achieving political goals (UNDP,
HDR 2021/22). On the other hand, the burden
of the crisis influenced gender relations,
worsening the position of young girls and
women related to increasing obligations in
the household in managing the effects of the
crisis, consequences on the labor market,
but also deriving from the impact of raised
levels of intimate partner violence and the
pressing need for protection by the state.
Both social polarization and gender issues
developments deserve separate analyses.

Gender Relations Under the
Impact of Uncertainty

from

stemming

The uncertainty
two
consecutive crises that have emerged in
a period of just two years pressure the
social landscape, with data indicating that
gender relations and gender equality are
being affected deeply. The effects of the
Ukrainian conflict are yet to be determined,
but the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic
are well documented with growing literature
supported by both qualitative and quantitative
data. In regard to gender relations, studies
show that “COVID-19 shock is likely to place
a disproportionate burden on women”
(Alon et al. 2020) mostly as a consequence
of dramatic changes
(un)employment,
childcare restrictions, and general perception
on gender norms. In general, the Covid-19
induced crisis has made “gender inequalities
for women and girls worse” (UNFPA 2020)
negatively affecting treatments and care, but
also the vulnerability to domestic violence.
HDR 2021/22 data have clearly displayed the
relation between economic dependability
and increase in intimate partner violence
(HDR 2021/22 source data) which does not
go in favor of improving the situation with
home violence globally, due to the adverse
economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic
on women and girls.

in

The Gender Development Index clearly
indicates that North Macedonia in this
category is the penultimate country in
the region by score, being that it has a
better score only compared to Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Although globally, North
Macedonia has a fairly high score, in the
regional context it is obvious that it has
to improve its efforts to meet the regional
average and be placed in the first cohort of
countries globally (currently placed in the
third cohort). As for the Gender Equality
Index (GEI) and its last edition in 2019
(Ministry of labor and social policy & State
Statistical Office), North Macedonia’s score
of 62 points sits just below the EU average
of 67.4 points. This places the country
in 16th place in comparison with the EU
countries. In the domain of power, the
country scores better than the EU. North
Macedonia has 52.6 points, compared
to the EU average of 51.9. However,
significant gender
inequalities remain,
especially when it comes to income and
earnings, and the sharing of household
responsibilities. For comparison: Serbia
scored 58.0 in 2021, Albania scored 60.4
points in 2019, Montenegro scored 55
points in 2019.

Speaking of gender relations and especially
focusing on the household as a unit that
from the Covid-19
has suffered heavily
adverse effects, data gathered
indicate
that domestic unpaid work has increased
significantly for women, further deepening
gender differences in unpaid domestic work
and care-related activities (Basevska, 2020).
During the Covid-19 crisis “much of the
extra childcare and the burden of “family”
duties fall on women, therefore making it
difficult for them to work as usual” (UNDP
SACINM, 2020). Even before the crisis, most
of the unpaid work in the household was
attributed to women, around 72% (Reaktor,
2020a) with an approximate gross value of
1,94 billion euros, equal to 17,18% of the total

value of the annual GDP of North Macedonia.
Current studies indicate that in three out of
five categories in the category of unpaid
domestic work (cleaning and maintenance
of the household, cooking and serving
meals and running the household) a large
statistical mass of women report increase in
time spent dedicated to household activities,
whereas the same situation is indicated in
three out of six categories in care-related
activities (communication with the children,
child nurturing and educational activities
with the children). In the first set of indicators,
the biggest difference is in the category of
preparing and serving meals, where as much
as 44% of women, compared to only 19% of
men, have reported an increase in the time

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX 2022 – NORTH MACEDONIA

21

needed to perform the activities. In the
second category the biggest discrepancy is
in the category of child nurturing where 21%
of the women have reported increase in time
spent, much like 16% of the men surveyed.
It becomes obvious that “the restrictive
measures and closing of schools and
kindergartens has made the load of unpaid
work more “visible” related to the care
undertaken by women” (Reaktor, 2020a).
Furthermore, the burden of the Covid-19 crisis
came in the form of labor market pressures

for the women due to the inability of many
women to utilize the measure for caretaking
of children under and 10 years old due to
fear or job termination by employer, frequent
enforcement by employers for “contractual”
termination of jobs and general pressures in
case of absences form the workplace ( job
termination, refusal of contract renewals,
cutbacks in salaries etc.). What is worse, job
terminations have been detected even in
regard to pregnant workers, that have not
been left out of this negative trend.

The same survey speaks on behalf of
the effects of the pandemic on gender
relations within the household relate to
gender roles within the family. In this
category, it is obvious that certain positive
trends are to be observed whereas 45% of
the surveyed women have indicated that
their partner is helping in the household
more than previously, while 25% have not
supported this claim. Similarly, 41% of the

women indicate that other family members
have landed a hand in household-related
activities during the pandemic, while 24%
did not indicate such a development. The
numbers in the category of additional aid
from children (sons and daughters) remain
rather low, probably due to the rapid
change in the educational environment of
the children to which they had to adapt and
devote more time to.

Data of the HDR 2021/22 indicate that
the population globally reports increased
levels of anxiety and stress associated with
rising pessimism and increase in mental
disorders
(HDR 2021/22 source data).
Within this broader frame, the increase in
gender-based and especially domestic
violence under the pressures caused by
the pandemic, have reflected in the local
context of North Macedonia as well. Studies
have confirmed that North Macedonia has
to overcome a set of challenges in gender-
based violence especially on local level
of communities affected by it (UNDP ACF,
2021 Paneva 2021, Cvetkovikj et al.2018)
and towards marginalized groups of women
(Boskova and Simonovikj 2021).

More precisely, local studies have also
shown that the problem of domestic violence
is persistent in during the Covid-19 crisis and
is not related to the level income within the
household, contrary to what HDR 2021/22

and physical

data suggest.4 According to additional local
studies, the two biggest threats for women
and girls in the context of the Covid-19
crisis in North Macedonia were economic
independence
security
(Reaktor, 2020b). Although nominally there
are less reports of domestic violence in the
first trimester of 2020, according to the
Reaktor study, field reports indicate that
domestic violence has significantly raised
during the Covid-19 crisis, with two cases
of femicide happening in less than two
weeks at the beginning of the pandemic.
Additionally, NGOs have warned against
a possible backlash in terms of increase
in cases of domestic violence after the
end of the proclaimed state of emergency,
with a warning to the state to prepare the
capacities
the situation.
Supporting evidence from UNDP indicate
that most of the murders (50%) took place
in the family home, i.e., the home where the
perpetrator and the victim lived together,

for alleviating

4 However, one must state that the sample of the survey by Pavlovski et al. is rather small so methodological limitations
must be taken in consideration if relation is to be made between the research and global HDR 2021/22 data.

24

while 25% of the murders took place in the
home where the victim lived alone or with
her parents or other family members (UNDP
ACF, 2021). This conclusion is just another
confirmation that women in the Republic of
North Macedonia are most insecure in their
home.

Moreover, data by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Policy indicate that there has been a
visible increase of women accommodated
in shelters on national level in 2020 (74
persons), which is almost double compared
to 2019 (38). One of the reasons might
be precisely the Covid-19 pandemic and

increased

the rise of domestic violence, although
other factors cannot be ruled out as well.
Speaking on the type of assistance, all
types of assistance have
in
North Macedonia in 2019, even before
the Covid-19 outbreak, with
the most
visible increase being in the categories -
psychological assistance and support, legal
aid, and temporary protection measures. All
in all, the trend of rise in domestic violence
protection indicates a rise in domestic
violence itself, but it could also indicate a
gradually awareness raising of the victims
and a more resolute approach towards
seeking help.

Political/Social Polarization
and Extremism

The declining support for democracy as
well as the decline in critical elements
for democratic governance universally
are clearly indicated in the HDR 2021/22.
In line with these negative trends are
also the rising insecurity in all ideological
orientation groups in society as well as
the positive relation between insecurity
and decrease in interpersonal trust as well
political extremism (HDR 2021/22 source
data). Such an atmosphere on a global level
is accompanied by visible rise in political
polarization of societies, as well as violent
extremism defined as “beliefs and actions
of people who use ideologically motivated
violence to pursue radical
ideological,
religious or political attitudes” (Government

Chart 14

of RNM in Mojanchevska et al., 2020).
is not an exception
North Macedonia
to this trend, with a history of violence,
even on the institutional level (Markovikj
and Popovikj, 2015). Out of several major
crises in the country, two concluded with
a violent episode - the Parliamentary crisis
in December 2012 as well as the storming
of the Parliament in April 2017. Additionally,
North Macedonia has been a subject to
increasing political and religious extremism
over a longer period of time, at times
threatening the very fundaments liberal
democracy in its essence and creating
“mistrust
between
the ethnic communities in the country”
(Mojanchevska et al., 2020).

Critical political questions and
policy orientation can also vastly contribute
to political and
social polarization,
especially in an atmosphere of economic
and social uncertainty. The
formative
political moments for North Macedonia in

the last two decades have been related
to the Ohrid Framework Agreement from
2001, the Prespa Agreement from 2018 as
well the acceptance of the EU’s proposal
for resolving the bilateral dispute with
Bulgaria in 2022. All of the mentioned

Speaking of renewable energy, the conflict
in Ukraine spurred a very vehement
global debate on energy sustainability and
independence of countries. Lesser degrees
of energy dependence of a given country
certainly contribute to lesser degree of
uncertainty, especially in an ambient of
steep rise of prices of commodities. In
the context of electric energy production,
North Macedonia still mostly depends on
in 2020
non-renewable sources where

sources

contributed
non-renewable
to as much as 3872 GWh or 72% of all
electricity generation, while renewable
resources contributed to 1475 GWh or
only 28% of all electricity generation.
The electric energy from renewable
sources originates mostly from hydro
energy (24%), wind (only 2%), bioenergy
(1%) while solar power contributed to
only 24 GWh, which is negligible and
below 1% (IRENA 2022).

However, it is obvious that there is a
gradual rise in utilization of renewable
resources in the last eight years, and that
certain categories of renewable resources
are still heavily underutilized such as
solar and wind power. Investment in and

towards

renewable energy
transition
does require long-term planning, but the
latest series of crises have definitely been
a warning on the importance of energy
sustainability and long-term investments
in the country.

attention to

attempt at raising the share of renewable
energy by 2050 to a considerable percent.
This obligation originates from the Paris

the efforts

in

that coal-fired

climate agreement, ratified in 2017, where
North Macedonia “committed to reducing
greenhouse gases by 52 percent, which
means
thermal power
plants must be closed by the end of the
decade, and that puts the country in a
very tough situation in relation with latest
developments
the world’s energy
crises”
(Ministry of Environment and
Physical Planning, 2021). The ambition of
the state is to” reduce the CO2 emissions
from fossil fuels combustion for 30%, that
is, for 36% at a higher level of ambition,
by 2030 compared to the business as
usual (BAU) scenario.” In terms of costs of
the efforts undertaken by the state they
are estimated at 7.7% of the total average
annual GDP.

The need for such strong commitment by
the state comes from the rather worrying
situation in the country related to the air
pollution, especially in the capital Skopje.
Data from a recent study on air pollution

32

in the capital (Mirakovski et al., 2022)
indicate that air pollution in the capital
Skopje mostly derives from CO2 emissions
while all other substances contribute to
a much lesser extent. The study exhibits
that the main culprit for the high polluting
emissions in the capital is domestic heating
where large amounts of biomass are being

consumed every year for heating purposes
– 91%. All other sources contribute to only
9%, with traffic pollution being second with
4%. This speaks even more firmly of the
need of developing renewable sources of
energy that will in time replace polluting
biomass and lead to a better HDI at least
in the part of increasing life expectancy.

Lastly, renewable sources of energy are
even more needed, taking in consideration
that agriculture is one of the sectors
of society that is heavily dependent on
energy. Being that “the agriculture sector
in North Macedonia has crucial socio-
economic importance” since “the sector

employed between 10% and 13% of the
active working population and contributed
7.6% to the GDP of the country in year
2021” (Dimitrievski & Dedinec, 2022), it is
important to notice that the “price of total
agricultural inputs has increased by 19.2%
in June 2022 in comparison to June 2021.”

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX 2022 – NORTH MACEDONIA

33

According to the study the production
inputs in June 2022 have increased by
25.8% compared to the same period last
year where the biggest impact on the
increase comes from: 1) energy sources
(fuel is especially important for agriculture)
– prices increased by 50.7%; and 2) mineral
fertilizers – prices increased by 65.9%.
The results of these market movements
are that “cost increases are a burden on
production; for cereal production, the costs

for fertilization have a share of 30% in the
total production costs, while the share of
fuel costs ranges from 15% to 30% of the
total production costs.” This explains the
rise in food prices but is also a call for action
in making bigger efforts in the transition
towards renewable sources of energy and
decreasing external dependence, while
trying to mitigate the raised costs of living
under the impact of the Ukrainian conflict
causing a global food crisis.

Triggered by several consecutive crises
of unpreceded magnitude, among which
the
latest are the Covid-19 pandemic
and the conflict in Ukraine, a new era
of uncertainty has commenced. Human
development, after almost three-decades
long constant growth, reached its plateau
and
is gradually declining ever since
2019. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated
the fall in the Human Development Index
globally, and almost all indicators from
the Human Development Report 2021/22
indicate that North Macedonia is barely an
exception to the general trend. Although
it belongs to the group of countries with
a high human development,
individual
analysis of segments affected by the
trends. Belief
crises
in democracy, trust
institutions and
pressures to local self-government are
just the beginning of a long list of factors

indicate worrying

in

to

developing a negative inclination. Current
developments generate visible pressures
on the enterprises as well as on the labor
market. Gender roles and gender equality
have greatly suffered from the Covid-19
crisis, putting additional burden on girls
and women. Social polarization in North
Macedonia has peaked to before unseen
the divisive
levels, proportionally
social and political issues present in the
political arena. Climate pressures burden
economic development while energy
sustainability has become a primary topic
for the experts, and primary concern for
the citizens. All these factors have created
a vortex of uncertainty and insecurity, out
of which a way out is yet to be found.
Hopefully, global, and national strategies
will eventually tackle the downward spiral
of human development and will contribute
to changing the trends for the better.

34

Pathway Through Uncertain Times –
is There a Way Forward?

and

The global
trends
tendencies
related to human development indicate
a downward trend ever since 2019. After
almost three decades of stable growth, the
HDI has been dropping in its value for two
years in a row, cancelling out almost five
years of development on a global scale.
North Macedonia is hardly an exception
to this rule, with negative trends in many
social spheres – social polarization, trust
institutions and democracy, gender
in
relations, climate, and socio-economic
pressures etc. Having both the global and
the local situation in mind a legitimate
question comes to mind – is there a

resolution, if not to solve, then to alleviate
the adverse effects of declining human
development? Who can offer a pathway
to such solutions? What should be done
to mitigate the risks stemming from the
combined financial, energy, pandemic,
and modern warfare crises?

The United Nations Development
Programme, based on data collected
the Human Development
through
Report 2021/22 might offer a part of the
answer through its authentic approach of
three “I”s – Investment, Insurance, and
Innovation (UNDP, HDR 2021/22):

regard
countries should direct
their efforts
towards expanding market and especially
social insurance in order to create a safety
net for the citizens. The groups that states
should be especially sensitive
to are
marginalized groups in society, that might
need additional insurances in times of
inadequate coverage of their basic needs,
either social, economic or other. Be it
projects like minimum income or universal

efforts in ensuring the population against

practices in promoting human rights aim
towards “identifying what binds us together
and en¬gaging people in dialogue about

against multilayered threats.

- INNOVATION relates to “mechanisms that

it comes to innovation should be tackling
misinformation as
“social media have

Another aim of possible innovative practices

for overcoming the skills shortage.” The
project is mainly focused on two project
activities:

is also exploring “the impact of the emerging
technologies on the workforce demand, and
how suitable measures through analyses

Within
the
countries’ resilience to risks and disaster
risk management, two major projects are
implemented by UNDP
currently being
and
in the country.
The first one is “Improving resilience to
floods in the Polog region” (https://www.
u n d p . o rg / n o r t h - m a c e d o n i a / p ro j e c t s /
improving-resilience-floods-polog-region),
whose goal is to “instigate transformational
change
the
in managing flood risk
region, accelerating the shift from purely
reactive responses to floods to integrated
systems to manage hazards, vulnerabilities
and exposure of communities and assets
losses and alleviate
to prevent/mitigate
the impact of future floods.” Although the
project is limited to the Polog region of the
Northwestern part of North Macedonia, it will
serve as a template in mitigating flood risks
in all parts of the country by improving both
preparedness and capacity, as well as finding
adequate responses to the risks. The second
project is being implemented by the Institute
for Democracy “Societas Civilis” – Skopje
(IDSCS) under the name “Improved capacity
in municipalities
for crisis response
in
(https://idscs.org.mk/
North Macedonia”
en/2020/11/06/improved-capacity-for-

“strengthen the strategic response to crises
for a selected number of municipalities in
North Macedonia and showcase a process
for

preparedness and response to crises for the
rest of the municipalities.” In synergy with
UNDP’s effort for mitigating flood risks, both
projects can create a blueprint for addressing
possible stressful occurrences related to
floods and natural hazards on the municipal
level.

Other projects that create a positive impetus
in society in its attempts to alleviate the state
of human development in the country relate
to projects such as “Empowering municipal

Finally, creating a pathway through uncertainty
stemming from multiple global crises requires a
detailed strategy for the country. That is exactly
why UNDP has partnered with the Government
of the Republic of North Macedonia in creating
the National Development Strategy (https://
www.nrs.mk/). The NDS will serve as “a guide
and vision for the Republic of North Macedonia
in the period 2022 – 2042” aiming to create
“a national consensus on the country’s long-
term development priorities and produce an
apolitical,
long-term
inclusively developed,
NDS that outlines identified priorities.”

A newly established Youth Resource
Centre – iCan (https://www.ican.mk/), the
training service provider and innovation hub
has provided support to young people in
Polog region in finding employment through
job seeking, business creation, career,
innovation and skills development, startup

strongest are the gender-based violence
and climate, thus the three “I” approach
should be enforced by the Government of
the Republic of North Macedonia mostly
in these specific areas. As for the HDI,
even if the HDI is globally experiencing a
decrease in value, that does not mean that
both local and international partners of the
country should shy away from attempts to
alleviate the burdens created by the global
and multidimensional crises creating a
global and multidimensional insecurity and
uncertainty. What is more, probably ever
since the HDI is being measured and the
HDR is being comprised, now more than
ever a synergy of governments, civil society
and international organizations is needed
in order to overcome the present situation
and return the HDI on the right path – an
increasing path indicating gradual bettering of
human development.
