## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

 

 

1.       South Africa has one of the highest failure rates for SMMEs, with five out of seven (70%) of businesses failing within the first year compared with a global average of 20%. According to research by the University of the Western Cape (UWC), only 1% of micro-enterprises who started with less than five employees have grown to employ 10 people or more. A negative consequence is that these businesses are not helping to solve the unemployment issue, and hardly contribute to the taxation base of the economy. In a webinar hosted among key sector stakeholders, such as Aurik Enterprise Development, Tiger Brands and the Small Enterprise Finance Agency (SEFA), the crucial importance of SMMEs in job creation was stressed due to SMMEs having higher capacity to absorb labour with a lower average capital cost per job created. SMMEs play a big role in addressing the major challenges of unemployment and inequality in South Africa. The failure rate of small businesses in South Africa is higher than the rest of the world, with access to finance being a major hurdle. Even within the innovation challenge conducted, only 3 out of 22 (14%) of shortlisted applications demonstrated potential to be successful.

 

2.       Key challenges faced by small businesses in South Africa include access to finance and alternative funding options, poor management and entrepreneurial skills, failure to market and network, poor business models, lack of access to technology, labour infrastructure and regulations, economic variables, crime and corruption, among others.  Within the South African Ecosystem, entrepreneurs are often borne out of the pure need for survival – their inability to find employment pushes them to become entrepreneurs to earn a living, and they often lack the skills and drive needed to be successful. The World Bank further states that lack of skills is one of the key constraints to reducing poverty and inequality in South Africa.

 

3.       According to research undertaken by the University of the Western Cape, McKinsey & Company, Cova advisory, and other sector experts, as well as the labs’s own experience of support SMMEs through innovation challenges, several challenges need to be addressed in order to bolster the ailing SMME sector in South Africa and enhance the country’s socioeconomic standing. These include the following.

 

- Improving access to new markets and finance: This includes access to foreign markets and new, emerging sectors such as the green, blue and digital economy. SMMEs need support to understand shifting market demands, untapped customer bases, and the potential to replace imported products with local substitutes. Market access for small businesses can also be enhanced through supplier development programmes that prioritise SMMEs as preferred suppliers, bridge gaps in business enablement that hinders SMME growth, and outsource back-office services that small businesses struggle with. Emerging SMMEs require strengthened networks to increase their access to investors, funders and technical support. Importantly, SMMEs require the skills necessary to pitch for such funding and to manage funds once received (business development support). SMMEs also need to be supported in understanding sector needs and gaps from those already operating within the sector. These role players have potential too provide SMMEs with critical guidance not usually available to outsiders and from desktop research.

 

- Improving small business competitiveness: This involves removing institutional/regulatory barriers to the creation of start-ups and their ability to do business locally and internationally. Training, mentorship and incubation programmes are needed to boost entrepreneurial and leadership skills development. A key aspect of training is investing in capacity building at leadership level to enable founders to transition to business leaders who can focus on growth and strategy. SMMEs require tools/frameworks to leverage innovation as a competitive edge, to introduce new products/services, to reach new markets and create distinct value propositions. Research and Development (R&D) are key requisites for growth and innovation in a successful entrepreneurship ecosystem. SMMEs need assistance to solve for key growth gaps, such as the need to focus on gaining operational efficiencies (e.g. waste and energy reduction) and implementing sustainable business operations (e.g. sustainably sourced raw materials). Solving such gaps empowers SMMEs to think broadly on measures to increase capacity and profit, versus focusing on increasing sales and improving cash management alone.

 

- Enrolling professionals into the business sector: South Africa has professionals in the engineering, financial, management, legal, and educational fields. The skills and experience of these professionals need to be galvanised as the catalyst for driving the capabilities required for SMMEs and to take advantage of South Africa’s strong standing as an offshore destination. Such professional skills will overcome several barriers SMMEs face, from regulatory hurdles to market access and business management.

 

 

4.       Many of the above recommendations are achievable by adopting a Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) approach. For example, new markets can be accessed through the green and digital economy and business competitiveness can be improved by employing innovations that produce lower cost and more effective goods/services, and innovations that enable improved operational efficiencies. STI professionals, when merged with the business world, can provide thought leadership, foresight, and direction thereby enhancing business sustainability.  Combined with training initiatives to impart the skills necessary to participate in the STI and knowledge economy, STI has strong potential to support a sustained economic recovery for South Africa, which is pivotal to tackle high levels of poverty, unemployment, inequality, and socioeconomic instability. South Africa’s Economic Recovery plan states that continued long-term investment into Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) in South Africa over the years can be leveraged to contribute to economic reconstruction and recovery in three areas:

-          RDI to revitalise and modernise existing industries/sectors

-          RDI that creates new sources of growth and stimulates R&D-led industrial development

-          RDI in support of a capable and developmental state

 

5.       Of the 22 innovative SMMEs interviewed in the innovation challenge process, only 6 considered sustainability within their business operations and processes, as well as in the design of their products/services. Of the 6 that included sustainable practices, these included the use of renewable energy sources in the development and implementation of their solutions, recycling and reuse of water sources, recycling waste materials to produce products, reducing footprint of large devices, and reducing energy consumption of products. A deeper analysis will be conducted throughout the project in 2023. There is also a need to expand the sample size to make better estimates of how businesses think about sustainability.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?




Yes, they are as follows:

 

- Partnerships are key to any project success as a single party doesn’t hold all the cards when it comes to transforming a complex system. The AccLab played a critical role in bringing together parties who usually don’t work together, and this was challenging as it required a lot of time and effort, moreso then the resources placed behind the project. Several engagements to facilitate discussions on mutual benefits, overcoming obstacles, finding common ground, etc. were convened by the AccLab. After a year of negotiating, all parties came to the party, not only participating in the project, but providing financial resources to scale the catalytic funding from the lab. From the labs initial USD 20 000 investment, we raised a total of USD 60 000, excluding in-kind services and support.

- Timelines were so severely impacted, that the project will continue well into 2023. The project required around one year of negotiations before implementation began. Once mutual ground was found, the operational/administrative process, such as which contracts will best serve all parties, required extensive research and legal counsel. The negative impact was the amount of time UNDP AccLabs spent on convening the partnership versus the actual work done to date, however the win lied in the fact that partners were brought together for the first time, and this may result in future, bigger projects within the innovation space.  

- UNDP’s internal operational processes requires that the AccLab utilizes procurement processes to use its funds, however the preferred partner/service provider was unable to tender to UNDP for the opportunity due to their own internal processes/bottlenecks. This had both parties at a standstill. The preferred service provider not only understood the sector well, but had years of experience working in the selected geographical location and was also willing to provide much needed financial resources. Together with the operational team and DRR we managed to find a route to work together, however this too required a lot to time and effort for a project that was meant to be of small, experimental scale.

- Misalignment of UNDPs and the National Government’s financial year. The National government’s financial cycle is usually from June to March every year. UNDP AccLab however has a financial year of Jan to Dec. As a result, several months are lost while government partners confirmed how much funds were available for the project.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Local youth, non-structured interviews, and technology hubs lie close to the problems on the ground which are often addressed through innovation challenges. They're viewpoints are key in framing a system and identifying leverage points for change, and for raising the issues they face in innovating to solve problems. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

To be able to test the hypothesis and assumptions upon which a solution was developed, and verify its real-world applicability and potential impact, alongside the eventual end users. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Innovation Hub Management Company - provided financial resources and technical skills/know-how regarding entrepreneur and skills development requirements of innovators and small businesses. Also provided coaching as needed. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Technology Innovation Agency (part of the Department of Science and Innovation) - provided financial resources and technical knowledge of the innovation system. E.g. what solutions may already exist, etc. 
The City of Tshwane - provided financial resources, technical knowledge of the service delivery challenges faced in the City, and several sites for the innovators to pilot their innovations. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The Innovation Hub Management Company - they offered specialist skills and knowledge in the innovation and entrepreneur support sector, as well as financial resources.


> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The cross section of partners and data gathered allowed us to examine the systemic problem (i.e. service delivery) from the lens of national and local government departments, as well as the citizens facing the issues on the ground. Usually these issues are raised by a single party/viewpoint, e.g. civic protests, or government annual reports. However on this project, we brought together various players which allowed us to truly understand the issues and potential solutions that will not only improve service delivery, but also enhance small business development where locals have the opportunity to solve the issues and provide the solutions themselves. This projects gave local start-ups and citizens the chance to offer solutions to the City on how to solve service delivery challenges such as water leaks, river pollution, e-waste management, etc.
