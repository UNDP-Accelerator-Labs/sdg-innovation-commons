> Title of the innovation

Rent A Place

> Brief description of the innovation

Rent A Place is An App designed to help students find a boarding house nearest to their campus. 
Universities And Colleges are being built every year but with little or no hostels to accommodate their students. Hence, Three quarters of the students in Zambia live in Boarding Houses. They have to move door to door in search of a boarding house which causes mental and physical stress. Our solution is an App that will help them track a boarding house nearest to their campus and we also help landlords manage their boarding houses financially.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our money comes in when the student selects which boarding house they prefer. In order to be connected to the Landlord, they pay a K20 to be taken to the actual house physically as compared to the K200 they spend on looking for a house on their own. Landlords are charged for every bed space they advertise on our App.

> Technical Feasibility

Our solution exists both as an App and a website and we plan on launching both in December when students start to look for accommodation for 2022.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The current platforms that exist are only focused on houses for rent or sale, but there isn't any platform focused on student boarding houses, hence, these students have to either move physical in search of a space or they have to search far and wide on Facebook. The beauty about our app is that it's focused on boarding houses, it's specific to the area you're looking for and it's organized.
