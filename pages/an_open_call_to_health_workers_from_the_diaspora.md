An open call to health workers from the diaspora to help Serbia fight the Coronavirus epidemic - the campaign for inviting all available (Serbian) medical staff from abroad to register if they would be ready to, if needs be, temporarily return and, with their knowledge, experience and skills, help combat the coronavirus epidemic in Serbia. More than 300 medical workers responded to our call to put themselves at the disposal of Serbia’s health system, either in person or via online medical consultations and guidance. (link)
