We live in a time of uncertainty, where the social and
environmental challenges that we are called upon to
address are changing every second.

Making progress, doing development work in such a
context requires new ways of thinking about problems
and solutions and new ways of collaborating and
working together.

UNDP is at the very forefront of
re-imagining development for the
21st century!

Sense is about understanding what emerging
challenges and opportunities in the local context
are and determining where we need to focus our
attention.

Explore is about better understanding the
challenges and looking for solutions, particularly
by looking at how citizens are already
addressing these challenges and opportunities.

Test is about assembling a portfolio of potential
solutions and continuously testing them until we
are conﬁdent, they can work.

Grow is about handing over the portfolio of
solutions, initiating new policy development or
develop new relationships and new ways of
doing things.

We are disrupting the way we think, deliver, invest
and manage to continue finding ways to perform
efficiently, better and at scale. This starts with an
effort to inject innovation into the organization’s DNA.
UNDP Accelerator Labs are an important part of that
effort.

The Global Accelerator Lab network is UNDP’s new
service offering that works with people, governments,
private sector, and other partners to create the next
generation of development practitioners.

The network consists of 91 labs across 115 countries.

in UNDP’s country offices, the

Embedded
labs
implement learning cycles to curate intelligence that
could feed into the organisation’s and the larger
development ecosystem’s work. This is done through
the four key activities of sensing, exploring, testing
and growing.

STRATEGIC PRIORITY

The UNDP Maldives Accelerator Lab was launched
on March 13, 2021 at a virtual event bringing together
actors from the government, private sector, civil
society as well as youth and actors in the innovation
ecosystem. The launch saw the participation of 86
participants on Zoom and reaching over 1200
individuals over Facebook from across the Maldives
and the globe.

Supporting the metaphor of dhoni (boat) to describe
the Maldives Accelerator Lab and the innovation
journey – the virtual launch engaged a host of
interesting and interactive elements and speakers to
provide the public with more information about the
lab and its way of working.

During the launch the Accelerator Lab also shared
more information about its first learning cycle which

focuses on the issue of exclusions in the labour
market.

Since the launch the Lab has continued to explore
the barriers that prevent certain groups, including
young people, women, persons with disabilities
(PWDs) and other groups at risk of being left behind,
from participating in the labor market, and had
agreed to focus on this issue within the larger frame
of Future of Work (FoW) as a strategic priority in
consecutive learning cycles.

The Lab is applying ethnographic methodologies
such as in-depth interviews, deep listening and user
journey mapping to uncover leverage points that
could be developed into sustainable pathways to
ensure meaningful, productive and full employment
for all.

BIG
THINGS

1

LEARNING
CYCLE ADVISORY
COMMITTEE (LCAC)

The Learning Cycle Advisory Committee (LCAC) was
set up with the aim of providing the Accelerator Lab
with a sounding board and advisory support during
the course of its learning cycles. The member
composition allows
for balanced and diverse
perspectives, knowledge and expertise with
members from different backgrounds representing
various fields and institutions.

The LCAC has been a valuable resource group
providing the lab feedback on the e-modules that
are being developed for the first experiment. More
details and profiles of the members can be found on
the UNDP Maldives website.

SUPPORTING THE COUNTRY OFFICE STRATEGIZE
ITS FOCUS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

The Accelerator Lab supported the UNDP Maldives
Country Office (CO) in the formulation of its next
Country Program Document (CPD).

UNDP’s CPD, formulated in partnership with national
stakeholders, is the main document which guides
and informs UNDP’s work in the Maldives. The UNDP
Country Programme 2016 – 2020 was extended till
the end of 2021 and the same year UNDP engaged in
a process to formulate its CPD for 2022 – 2026.

When we say we are supporting, we are really at the
heart of it. It all started in December 2020, when
Senior Management asked the Accelerator Lab to
design a process that the CO could engage in to
ensure that the CPD formulation was participatory,
engaging, and innovative.

We embarked on an exciting process of collaborating
with colleagues in the CO to design and execute an
exciting process of making sense of what we have
done and continue to do, the changing development
landscape and more.

It began with a series of brown bag sessions, lots of
exchanges over a mapping of our ongoing initiatives,
a series of internal consultations with the entire staff
at UNDP Maldives during the staff retreat on what
UNDP should focus on in the next five years, a series
of consultations with national stakeholders on the
same question, visualizing a Theory of Change and
then came the contributing to an initial draft and the
rest …..is history.

If you are interested in learning more about some of
the things, we learnt through the consultations tap
into this episode of the Frontier Dialogues.

FIRST EXPERIMENT

Photography by ASHWA FAHEEM / UNDP MALDIVES

The first experiment of the UNDP Maldives Accelerator
Lab is based on the learning question ‘can improving
soft skills help young people in securing and retaining
employment?’ With this question, we wanted to test
whether online learning of soft skills would improve
the possibility of securing and retaining employment.
The concern of poor soft skills in the young working
population, the importance of soft skills in enhancing
one’s employability coined with
inadequate
opportunities to acquire these skills recurred in our
early explorations. The Assumptions will be tested
with the help of data on different impact indicators
that will be collected via the e-learning platform
Kiyeveni where three e-modules on soft skills will be
hosted.

Early on, during the designing of our first experiment
we wanted to ensure that we adopt a human
centered and participatory approach.

Accelerator Lab team designed and executed the
participatory design session aimed at gauging the
perspectives of ‘potential users’ of e-learning on soft
skills. Accelerator Lab Maldives deeply felt the need
to draw in user perspectives from individuals who
may not be often involved in such a process. The
central purpose of the participatory design session
was to identify needs and expectations of potential
users of e-modules and harness an
informed
understanding of user journeys in relation to online
learning.

ENHANCING INCLUSION OF PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES (PWDs) IN CIVIL SERVICE

As 2021 progressed, we explored further and deeper
the exclusions of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in the
labor market. This led to a productive collaboration
with the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to support
them in a policy under formulation, focusing on
inclusion for PWDs in Civil Service employment.

These processes generated novel insights on the
impacted stakeholders, existing solutions,
issue,
and possible solutions. Furthermore, it validated
and generated valuable feedback on the proposed
policy.

As part of this process, CSC and Accelerator Lab
engaged with different actors including PWDs, civil
society organizations, government and private
sector. We also conducted a Collective Intelligence
Design workshop convening multiple stakeholders
from different parts of the system. Additionally, during
the lab field missions we conducted direct interviews
to listen to civil service offices based in the islands
to understand key factors for consideration to ensure
successful policy implementation on the ground.

The learnings from this will flow into the policy
draft which is currently being reviewed by CSC.
Also informed by the learnings, Accelerator lab is
developing an experiment to test the recruitment
pathways in the policy. A job readiness assessment
tool for PWD’s is developed and we look forward to
test the use of this tool through the experiment.

NEI’THA HALLEH?

In the year 2021, the Maldives
Accelerator Lab conducted two
solutions mapping exercises.

The first solutions mapping exercise, which was
branded as a Solutions Safari was conducted
between March and May and focused on mapping
solutions to the broad category of sustainable
development challenges. It was fully virtual, and
solutions were solicited through an online call.

UNDP Maldives Accelerator Lab engages in solutions
mapping to provide visibility to local solutions and
local innovators and to capture the lessons learnt
and the experiences of these local solutions so
that rather than trying to re-invent the wheel, we
try to grow what has already worked. Mapping
also provides us an opportunity to understand the
nuances of the local innovation ecosystem and
gain insights into what it would take to foster an
environment in which local innovations and solutions
could sprout and thrive!

The second solutions mapping exercise, Nei’tha
Halleh? focused on capturing
local sustainable
tourism solutions. This exercise was conducted over
a period of two months between October and
December. In addition to the online open call, the
Accelerator Lab also undertook a field mission to
Kaafu, Alifu Alifu and Alifu Dhaalu atolls to look for
solutions.

We collated and presented the solutions in our very
first edition of Ha’llu Foshi – A Catalogue of Local
Solutions Mapped in the Maldives.

SOCIAL INNOVATION PLATFORMS (SIPs) FOR
FUTURE OF WORK

The Accelerator Lab, with support of the SDG
Integration Unit of the Bangkok Regional Hub is
working with Agirre Lehendakaria Center (ALC) on
establishing Social Innovation Platform (SIPs) for
Future of Work (FoW) in Maldives. This would help
us understand the complexity and systemic nature
of this cross-cutting issue and inform the design of
a portfolio of interventions which can be integrated
into the country office program as well as our own
learning cycles in the future. Within the 12 months
of the process, we seek to set the foundations for a
social and economic transformation by reaching an
initial portfolio of options connected with the existing
social dynamics operating in the selected location.

In 2021 we conducted systems mapping and a bottom
up deep listening process collecting data from
selected atolls across the country, centered broadly
around the theme of Future of Work (FoW). We field
tested the interview guides developed for the deep
listening with Island level stakeholders from during
our field mission to selected islands in November.
The listening tool was revised based on this testing
before handing over to a local consultancy firm to
undertake the data collection.

The first iteration of listening collected over 215
interviews from twenty islands in the north (Haa Alifu,
Shaviyani, Raa, Baa Atolls) , central (Lhaviyani Atoll )
and south (Laamu, Gaafu Alifu, Gaafu Dhaalu Atolls
and Fuahmulah City) regions. Interviewees include,
local council members, WDC members, NGOs, PWDs,
foreign and domestic workers, women and men in
formal and informal sector, temporarily unemployed,
recovering addicts, and people in further education/
training etc and individuals. We worked closely with
the consultant, at times accompanying them on field
field visits to ensure we involve the local voices, both
the usual and unusual suspects in the deep listening
process. The field listening process was enhanced
by a digital listening exercise to analyze the digital
spectrum of narratives amplifying the outreach.

With the first listening complete, we are in the
process of analyzing the data with support of ALC
and moving on to Collective Interpretation and Co-
creation.

SUPPORT TO COUNTRY OFFICE (CO)

The Re-imagining Tourism Project

The Re-imagining Tourism project is a joint initiative between the Government and UNDP Maldives
to explore, develop and test pathways for making tourism in the country more inclusive, resilient,
and sustainable. It’s built on the backbone of really asking – how can we ensure that tourism
dividends are distributed more equitably to people and planet?

The Accelerator Lab took the lead in supporting the CO design this project and we supported the
initial phases including the design and implementation of a project inception workshop.

This project re-invigorated the space for UNDP Maldives to play a key role in shaping the future of
the country’s tourism industry. The Accelerator Lab, along with other colleagues in the CO are also
a part of a larger community of practice within UNDP that is trying to create and engage with new
frames of conversation for creating systems transformation in the tourism space.

camp
for youth organized by the The
Integrated Governance Programme(IGP) sees
joint support across units. In its 4th run this
year, Accelerator Lab was glad to be asked to
support the camp. The lab facilitated sessions

Annual Reporting, Communications and Gender SEAL

Accelerator Lab also supports other various CO activities in different capacities. Early in 2021,
AccLab coordinated the Result Oriented Annual Reporting (ROAR) process. The Lab is also
represented in the CO Gender Focal Team (GFT) supporting the CO Gender Seal process. We also
support the CO communication’s efforts for marking International Days relevant to our work like
World Innovation and Creativity Day and World Youth Skills Day.

THE NETWORK-ENGAGING WITH THE ECOSYSTEM

Accelerator Lab continuously scans the development
ecosystem and engages with them through different
channels. This was a challenge given the lockdowns
and COVID-19 restriction measures. Yet, it didn’t stop
us! The lab had virtual exploratory conversations
with different actors in and out of Maldives to
introduce, exchange and explore mutual interests.
From these conversations, many unusual suspects
and local innovators were discovered, expanding the
Lab’s network and develop an initial mapping of the
national ecosystem.

As we narrowed down on our challenge and strategic
priority, we had more focused conversations with
different stakeholders, including government, civil
society and private sector as well as individuals and
local communities. The frontier dialogue podcast
also provided another platform to reach out to many
different actors. Following the first solutions mapping,

chat with solutionists and special Frontier Dialogue
series with them again helped further penetrate
these circles.

Investing in building relationships early on meant
when we needed stakeholder input and participation
in our different activities. This brings immense value
to our work as it allows us to hear multiple narratives
and see diverse perspectives.

Towards the end of the year, with the easing of the
COVID-19 restrictions, the field missions were another
opportunity
to engage with different actors
operating at the local level, again adding a rich layer
of insights from the ground which we were lacking to
some extent.

LEARNING
FROM EACH
OTHER

Despite these bigger bets and our support to CO on
different interventions, we are also intentional about
our learning journey. We availed various learning
opportunities to develop our capacities and sharpen
our tools -as well as added new ones to our toolbox!

The lab as a team participated in the Action Learning
Lab on Theory U for systems transformation offered
by SDG Integration. Head of Exploration from the lab
participated in training on Horizon scanning in
addition to working with RBAP Foresight network on
the RBAP horizon scanning exercise. Our Solutions
Mapper participated in the Tourism Stencil training
organized by the Global Innovation Unit.

lab also benefited from the rich

learning
The
exchanges that occur on the Accelerator Lab weekly
global call, bi-weekly Heads calls as well as SIDS
and RBAP Accelerator Lab network calls. In addition,
all three Heads make time for individual learning
interests like the Data Thursday series, UN Language
learning courses and more.

As a learning network, sharing our
learning is as much a priority

Following the working out loud principle, the lab
shares about its work and learnings in written blogs
shared widely (Blog 1:“Why can’t I get work?”, Blog 2:
Cutting through Gen Z, Blog 3: Reflections on the
Innovation Journey, Blog 4: A closing window of
opportunity, Blog 5:One year of the Maldives
Accelerator Lab). We also take time to pen down bi-
weekly reflections and to share them with the
network.

Moreover, after the lab’s field missions, we synthesized
the insights gathered in an Intelligence Brief shared
with the CO. Other on and off learning events occur
through brownbag and learning sessions facilitated
for colleagues, as part of the CO learning committee
plans.

We welcome any thoughts on how best the lab can
diffuse and amplify knowledge.

LOOKING AHEAD

We are excited to enter 2022 so to further refine our
direction aiming at enhanced relevance and traction.
Both from the management and the units, we
collectively sense a revamped eagerness to carve
out more strategic pathways for integrating the
Accelerator Lab’s work and its methodologies into
the CO work. To ensure that WE, as a whole live up
to the promise of being more anticipatory, agile and
effective in delivering development results.

We are hoping that this refinement journey will be
one fueled by radical honesty, playfulness, and
collaboration and at best – a journey that continues
for…. Ever.
