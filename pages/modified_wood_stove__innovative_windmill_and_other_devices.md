Among various innovations of his, only one dealing with cooking stove is taken up for elaboration. Stoves having three chambers connected in parallel are available in art; Astra stove (Jagdish K.S.2004, The development and dissemination of efficient domestic cook stoves and other devices in Karnataka Current Science 87(7):pp. 926-931). But these chambers are connected horizontally.In this case, the stove consists of two chambers, each with a burner for cooking, and a geyser for heating water. Both burners can be used simultaneously, saving time and using the heat effectively. The heating chambers are oriented at different levels in order to be able to completely utilise the heat energy produced connected to a chimney, which provides part of the draft.Inside the main chamber, mud has been used as insulating material to retain the heat. There are air vents on the sides of the first chamber to allow cooling of stove so that it is not too hot to touch for the women/men using it.Bharatbhai is working further on the stove and wants to add another chamber (which can be utilized for steam cooking). He wants to fine tune its thermal effeciency, reduceassembly?s weight and cost by making stove body with GI sheet. He envisages building versions with different burner attachments.While he has sold more than three-dozen units of the current model locally, he is planning to launch commercial versions having two burners with geyser and one burner with geyser. This product may have considerable social impact and commercial potential.
