> Description of the solution

An innovative mechanism for financing energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements on private property. PACE programs exist for Commercial properties and Residential properties. The unique characteristic of PACE assessments is that the assessment is attached to the property rather than an individual. 
The recent extension of this financing model to energy efficiency and renewable energy allows a property owner to implement improvements without a large up-front cash payment.
