The proposal of digitizing the emigrant card and creating a digital remittances platform was raised and discussed. Towards the end of November 2023, the Secretary of State submitted the proposal to the council of ministers to create a digital emigrant card. 
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Focus Group: This was used to get diaspora and government perspectives. Additionally, it was used to map what had already been done with other organizations such as IOM and what recommendations were proposed. 


Official government data: To be able to gage the number of emigrant cards that were issued, to understand the demand and supply of cards as per the government recording of items. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Solutions Mapping: This method was engaged to map what had been done in the past in order to learn from lessons presented previously to the General Direction of Communities and be able to come up with new solutions. 


Visual Thinking &amp; Mapping: This method was engaged in order to conduct a Futures Thinking Workshop that aimed to understand how the future could look for the diaspora and what solutions needed to be developed in order to achieve the identified objectives.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The methods used allowed for us to horizon scan and identify the key areas of focus and scope of the work which has been done and continued to be done. This would not be possible without the use of innovation and mapping exercises with the relevant partners.
