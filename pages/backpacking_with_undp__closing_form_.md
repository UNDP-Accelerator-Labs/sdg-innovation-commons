## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. In order to have a successful meeting space that people attend and take ownership of, it is necessary to design it with the participants at the center throughout the entire exercise, so that the agenda and activities can be adapted to the needs of the group. This flexibility should allow for the inclusion of non-conformities, differences in approach to challenges or exogenous constraints of the participants (such as work or care responsibilities).

2. To maintain presence and open dialogue among actors from diverse sectors, who think differently (sometimes oppositely) and are sometimes distrustful of the methodology, it is important to combine global sessions with bilateral dialogues in which dialogue with a single group and address their particular concerns and stories.

3. Getting to know the perspectives and experiences of diverse people promotes a collective understanding of the problem. Contrasting statistical data with people's experiences can help the community validate or supplement pre-existing understanding of the issues. On the other hand, knowing the differential impact of issues on particular groups in the community - e.g., women, youth, children, etc. - leads people in the group to expand their framing of the problem and, consequently, to analyze the challenges and seek solutions that go beyond their personal experience.

4. Even when working with a small group of people, it is possible to bring to the table elements of the vision of people in the community who are not present through activities based on creativity and sensory experiences, which contributes to developing greater empathy and curiosity for other perspectives.

5. Collective exploration of local challenges unveils non-obvious interconnections and helps align interests among stakeholders with different concerns. Reflecting on local challenges and desired goals with a group of people with diverse knowledge, needs and experiences helps to break down silos or thematic boundaries within the community. This collective process opens the space to identify solutions and build more inclusive, participatory and intersectoral pathways for change.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The field experiences of the pilots of the "De Mochilazo with UNDP" initiative in Aramberri, Nuevo León and San Juan Tlacotenco, Morelos, showed how approaching human development challenges from a systemic perspective offers opportunities for the community to recognize the big picture and the roles of the different actors in the problem they wish to solve. However, a major barrier was the short time frame of the intervention. To date, it is still not possible to say that the exercise served its purpose beyond igniting the curiosity of local stakeholders and triggering conversations around challenges with a different perspective than the traditional one.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We choose these types of data because they relate to being in the field hand in hand with people in communities as well as prior to the visit, census data and literature reviews allowed for a better understanding of what type of issues the communities in such territories faced.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The methods listed allowed for a broad discussion of the wider system that causes the issues that the people wanted to fight against.
## Partners
****

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

ProSociedad was hired to help in the design of the methodological framework and the implementation of the intervention, Isla Urbana was hired to conduct a diagnostic in San Juan Tlacontenco and summon the community because of their prior work in the region

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo León helped us summon the local authorities, Gobierno del Estado de Morelos attended the event and participated in the focus groups

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The local communities of Aranberri and Jan Juan where new and unusual partners that had never worked with the Lab 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborated with the Social &amp; Economic Development unit of UNDP Mexico
## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The systems approach allowed for a better understanding of the local issues and, together with the participatory methods used allowed for the building of joint responsibility between the local stakeholders
