## Title

Public Informal Transport in Lebanon
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge are the social, infrastructural, and behavioral barriers to accessing the informal public transport in Lebanon. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

A protracted political and economic crisis has made the need for public transpiration greater than ever. However, Lebanon does not currently have a formal public transport sector. Instead, there is a complex network informal public transpiration services that include private buses, inter-city vans, shared taxies, and ride-sharing apps. Our preliminary research has shown that many residents of Lebanon do not access these modes of transportation for a number of reasons, such as safety concerns, unreliability, unclear pricing, racism, sexism, and social stigma. As a result, people continue relying on their own vehicles, often sacrificing their mobility.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Given the lack of official data, our Accelerator Lab is in a unique position to gather and make accessible representative data related to perceptions and behaviors around public informal transportation in Lebanon. Our Lab's expertise in behavioral insights will allow us to experiment with nudges to encourage the people of Lebanon to use public transport.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

As the need for public transport continues to increase, UNDP Lebanon's AccLab is looking into the social, infrastructural, and behavioral barriers to accessing informal public transport.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The insights from this work and the experiments will hopefully benefit the private sector and the Ministry of Pubic Works and Transport.
