Manna Coffee has existing waste segregation practices, these are wastes that they collect from operating as a 3-in-1 business. On top of this, Mana Coffee also practices composting food scraps and other biodegradables. This initiative helps to reduce the amount of food waste that ends up in a landfill. When hazardous waste is separated and processed separately, pollution of the air and water can be greatly avoided. To ensure that waste is properly handled, it must be placed in separate bins. In the long run, Mana Coffee is doing its part in safeguarding Fiji's beautiful environment.
