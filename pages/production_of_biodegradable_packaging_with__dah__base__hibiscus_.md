This initiative takes us to the interior of Mali, notably to the capital of the Kénédougou region of Sikasso, where a local company produces reusable and biodegradable bags made from hibiscus stalks.

The company would like to substitute these dah (hibiscus) fibre bags for plastic bags in order to contribute to the fight against environmental pollution. It is also about connecting small producers to large companies.
