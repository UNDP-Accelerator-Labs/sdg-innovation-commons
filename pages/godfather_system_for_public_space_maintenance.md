## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Isa Bergh Lopes da Costa

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

02/02/23

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Public Space 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Access to Basic and Quality Public Service Delivery

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How might we improve access to basic and quality public service delivery? Public Space is here considered a form of public service delivery, viewed through the lens of providing benefits and enhancing the well-being of the community.

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We would like to learn how a Godfather system can create cleaner and more well maintained public spaces.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

"IF public spaces are maintained through a Godfather system, THEN they will be cleaner, better maintained, and more enjoyable."

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The Godfather system will involve the engagement of local entities (see partners) who will pay a monthly fee to the Bissau Municipality who will perform the maintenance. Data will be collected before and after the intervention of the Godfathersystem measuring the change. The following data will be collected:  

a) Observation - The cleanliness of public spaces (e.g. presence of garbage, etc.)  

b).  Survey - The frequency of maintenance activities (e.g. cleaning, garbage collection, etc.)  

c) User Perceprion Questionnaire - The public's perception of cleanliness, satisfaction and maintenance of public space.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

User perception interviews, observation and frequency of cleaning/ waste collection

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data will be collected before and after the intervention of the Godfathersystem. The following data will be collected:  

a) Observation - The cleanliness of public spaces (e.g. presence of garbage, etc.)  

b).  Survey - The frequency of maintenance activities (e.g. cleaning, garbage collection, etc.)  

c) User Perceprion Questionnaire - The public's perception of cleanliness, satisfaction and maintenance of public space.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 monts (2 weeks baseline data collection, 4 weeks testing the Godfather system, 2 weeks endline data collection)

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

8 months of time allocation from the team so far. The Government has been instable and our partners at the Municipality has been exchanged three times so far, slowing down the process as it takes time to build up trust.
