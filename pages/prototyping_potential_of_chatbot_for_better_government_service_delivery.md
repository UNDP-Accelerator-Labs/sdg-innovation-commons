Prototyping Potential of Chatbot for Better Government Service Delivery
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that, the digital system of the governments only provides one way information meaning they mostly publish the news and information with limited interaction with people. On the other hand, information available online is difficult to navigate most of the times. So, people mostly connect with their contact person or visit physically to access basic information. So, there is no one door access to information to local government information.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Many GoN agencies are resorting to digital technologies to share their information, deliver e-services and establish better relationship with their people. There is much information published on the website and most of the websites consists of grievance, complain and queries submission mechanism. However, many people face difficulty navigating the websites and most of the complains and queries submitted through the websites are never addressed due to lack of grievance redressal process. There is insufficient human resource dedicated to handle online queries and guide people to get service from the local government. As a result, many people must visit physically to the local government offices to get answer to simple and repetitive queries that could easily be handled online. The use of advanced digital technology specially AI is absent.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

The Government of Nepal (GoN) is increasingly adopting digital technologies to provide better services. Additionally, there are few companies working on frontier technologies on AI and NLP. Connecting both the frontier technologies and digital initiatives of the GoN can provide better access to information and services.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab in Nepal is uniquely placed to connect the different stakeholders required for successful implementation of the chatbot system. While the AI company is working on its own on Nepali Natural Language Processing (NLP), most of the government agencies are unaware of it and its implications for better service delivery. The wider UNDP team is working on their own projects and portfolios and exploration on the AI and NLP is absent where accelerator lab is filling the gap. So, the Acclab team in Nepal is bringing together the Ai company, government and wider UNDP team for design and implementation of the system. It is worth exploring the AI based chatbot system as it has the potential to improve service delivery through cutting edge Ai based system.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



AccLab Nepal is testing the potential of chatbot system integration in the Government of Nepal's digital system for better service delivery.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Will AI based chatbot system integrated in Local government improve access to information for general population? Will the system improve service delivery?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The lab will work with the developers to develop relevant and localized AI/ ML based technology for development of chatbot for local government of Nepal. The system will work heavily on Nepali language regarded as low resource language for NLP. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The project will digitize the citizen charter of the local governments. Many local governments dont have updated citizen charter and even more of them dont have digitized citizen charter suitable for NLP
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The general population of the country will have better access to information and services. The local goverment of Nepal will be champion the system and support in further scale-up.
