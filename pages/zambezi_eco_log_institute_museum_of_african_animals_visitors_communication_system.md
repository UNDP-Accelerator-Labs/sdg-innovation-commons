> Title of the innovation

Zambezi Eco-Log Institute Museum of African Animals Visitors Communication System

> Brief description of the innovation

Development of a Centre of Excellence Science Museum, housing all African Animal species taxidermy statues. The innovation lies in the adjustment of on-board flight entertainment technology being converted to incorporate visitors to be guided and taught concerning each animal species by an encyclopedia-informed gate-issued phone app. The Museum's animals (stuffed) are to be installed on dis-used planes, located in a forest. The planes' interiors would have been refurbished to reflect the natural habitat in which the animals are found. The demographics and peculiar characteristics of the animals would be learning points taught on the smart phone headset arrangements through interactive learning.  This learning center would provide a learning platform for game management officers, environmental management practitioners, climate change analysts, conservationists, students and the public at large. The software would also educate on the surrounding Museum's surrounding Miombo forest and the actions being undertaken to grow it back to enhanced levels of density and diversity, as well as the means of preserving this habitat and wildlife.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will:
1. decrease the cost of curation at the museum and increase the quality of the learning experience
2. be charged to the gate takings of the museum
3. the novelty of the innovation will itself draw return visitors and new visitors and will minimize curator roles in this Covid social distancing period
4. As the overall objective of the museum is to promote environmental awareness, concern and management, its expected that visits will contribute to societies mainstream appreciation of the environment but will more specifically also contribute to enhancing the training and understanding of environmental managers and stakeholders who come through the museums learning modules.  
5. also be sold in suitable reconfigured format to other museums, exhibition managers, and other service and education providers who are seeking to enhance institutional communication to their visitors, clientele, students and other knowledge beneficiaries.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed along four components. 1. Ones own hand held smart phone for receiving knowledge information in script, sound, picture and video through blue tooth or wifi. 2. The geographic positioning system that tells ones location proximity to an museum exhibition and remotely brings to the phone app the landing website interface for the exhibit in question. 3. The complementing phone app component that translates ones interaction on the phone with information-on-demand that is available on the adapted inflight entertainment system. 4.  the transmitter from an inflight entertainment system to app users connected to local area network 5. The actual inflight entertainment units; and 6. the modules of the body of information and data that will inform the end user visiting the museum and surrounding forest.

There is no prototype. Implementation is required in the next two years to complement development of the museum.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve lives overall by contributing to more 
1. environmentally caring and responsive individuals, communities and society at large.   
2. appreciation of Africa's natural wonders
3. effective management of the environment by key drivers of conservation; and 
4. concern by the public of what climate change is doing to wildlife habitat and consequently the populations of wildlife so as to make it conscionable conduct to neglect or actively degrade the environment, and consequently preserve natures provisions for posterity.

With regard to relevance to the current market, the penetration of smart phones has increased significantly in this millennium, the age of those going to museums, exhibitions and parks is high, tech agility is on the increase and an app of this nature would be appealing in a learning environment. Additionally the period of COVID 19 tends to put both education providers and students at risk of passing on the virus and extending the pandemic. The remote use of such an app promote COVID 19 hygiene in public spaces
