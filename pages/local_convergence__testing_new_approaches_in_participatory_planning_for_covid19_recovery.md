## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The AAA Recovery project aims to promote and support AAA participatory recovery in 15 local government units, with the following outputs in each of the localities: (a) convene multi-stakeholder networks; (b) engage local officials to advocate for participatory planning; (c) implement multi-stakeholder recovery planning; (d) engage donors and stakeholders to advocate for the participatory plan or agenda; (e) develop a roadmap plotting out higher ambition for the local convergences beyond the 6-month project.  We are experimenting within this project to pursue this learning objective: how can social innovation tools be customized and utilized for the 15 local convergences to facilitate a common understanding of local development and recovery issues, catalyze co-creation of solutions and collaboration, and pave the way for further experiments for deepening understanding of how specific solutions--particularly grassroots solutions--could work. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

BROAD (on local convergence): IF we expand and strengthen local convergences as advocacy and action coalitions for development THEN local development particularly COVID19 recovery can be accelerated.  

SPECIFIC (to the Talyer process prototyping): IF we introduce foresight, systemic design, and data innovations into the local multi-stakeholder consultation and planning processes, THEN the coalitions will forge a strong common ground and basis for collective action not only in the 6 months of the project but also beyond. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Broadly, the local convergence expansion effort required the contracting of a civil society network (PHILDHRRA) who will tap 15 lead local convenors in the selected areas, coordinate actions to pursue the five outputs enumerated above, offer technical support to the local convergences, and collaborate with UNDP PH (ALab and Pintig data lab).  To test the specific hypothesis, UNDP PH developed and cascaded a local multi-stakeholder planning process template and toolkit called the Talyer, building on lessons from the past experience in prototyping a local convergence toolkit for ZEP. The Tayer toolkit (link below) is a compilation of various recommended social innovation tools that the local convenors may customize and use in their respective local convergences' planning exercises. ALab held a series of Talyer clinics for the local convenors to provide hands-on learning on the tools. ALab and Pintig also collaborated to compile data assets and produce data briefers that the local convernors could use as input to their local participatory planning: data on poverty, local SDG attainment, COVID19 trends, and local fiscal affairs.  

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Locality or local government unit (LGU), defined as either a province or city

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Mainly observation and consultation with the local convenors to fine tune the Talyer toolkit and the data briefers. PhilDHRRA will be responsible also for monitoring and reporting on the progress of the 15 local convergences. Formal focus group discussions and informal conversations were also conducted with the 15 local convergences at key stages of the process and after the contract period.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time and effort from the three ALab PH Heads to design and conduct the Talyer sessions; collaboration of other ZEP2030 PH technical working group members to support PhilDRHHA; references on the various social innovation tools used; data tools collated by ALab and Pintig data lab over time. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The experiment was completed in June 30, 2023, where the 15 local convergences produced participatory recovery plans that were submitted to their partner LGUs (see link belof for the compendium) and crafted sustainability roadmaps for the multi-stakeholder coalitions. The hypothesis is partly proven, considering how the local convenors favorably viewed the value of the social innovation tools introduced, although they expressed concern on the difficulty of using the tools given the limited time. "If we had more time" was the common reframe. As to whether the participatory process led to better quality plans and their adoption, a follow-up stocktake needs to be made a year or two after to asses a) if the local government indeed integrated and funded the citizen inputs in their local plans and budgets and b) if the local multi-stakeholder coalitions continue to be operational.  

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We were quite ambitious in the methodology that we had introduced vis-à-vis the timeline that we have and the capability of the local convenors. On the timeline, it is unfortunate that the contract was awarded during the campaign period for the 2022 elections (to be held on 9 May) and this has been repeatedly cited by the local convenors as a main stumbling block (stakeholders are preoccupied, lack of local government attention, etc). On the capability of the lead local convenors, while they were appreciative of the methodology, they expressed reservation on their lack of expertise to deliver the tools, even as ALab attempted to select and design the tools to be used to be as simple as possible. In subsequent iterations, we will further simplify the methodology, perhaps focusing only on either foresight or systemic design (not both). 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

One year because of the prolonged timeline for TOR development and procurement. After initiating procurement in mid-2021, contract was awarded only at the end of December 2021. Work was stalled in January due to Omicron surge. We were only able to start in February. But with the project which funded this work lapsing in June 2022, we only had five months to implement the actual participatory recovery planning exercise. Additional resources were invested from ALab core funds to undertake field visits and dialogues with some local convergences until the end of 2022. 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

120,000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This experiment is intended to feed into the development of a new programme offer on AAA Local Governance. Additional experiments or at least touch-base meetings with the local convenors are intended. Collaboration with the ZEP movement to support the 15 local convergences is also intended to continue. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Still to be decided for this specific experiment, but ideally with the Department of the Interior and Local Government as well as in continued collaboration with civil society through the ZEP movement

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The primary constraint was the late start of the undertaking and other exigencies that led to a compressed timeline. The actual participatory planning exercise also coincided with the election period, further limiting the movement of the local multi-stakeholder coalitions. In a handful of LGUs, the incumbent administration changed, posing a challenge to the local coalitions who needed to re-engage the governor and the mayor to seek their buy-in to the participatory plan. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Programme teams generally, especially those that might benefit from co-creation and collective agenda setting and action for their respective programmes. The new approaches in the Talyer toolkit (some of the tools to be incorporated into an emerging ALab PH toolkit) can serve as a suite of tools for programme teams to use for facilitating change through collective action. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Local governments and civil society / multi-stakeholder networks (including but also beyond the 15 provinces and cities convered by this experiments) 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, iterations were mainly to "soften" the level of ambition and minimize the data and innovation tools that the local convergences were "required" to use, a) after receiving feedback from the local convenors during the briefing sessions; b) during implementation by the local convenors, to account for time constraints and exigencies on the ground. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Ensure sufficient time and preparation for local convenors and other innovation laymen, including time to test the tools themselves before execution. Moreover, soften the level of ambition and focus on a few tools that are absolute necessities, while being prepared to scale ambition when partners express readiness. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, the thematic focus of participatory planning will just need to change. For example, a variant of the same was conducted with the Malay municipal government in the context of the Boracay Food System challenge. Moreover, the local multi-stakeholder networks can potentially be tapped for co-creation and co-implementation for programmatic areas, for example in Circular Economy. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The experiment was informed by past sense and explore phases with respect to the broader local convergene challenge area and collaboraiton with ZEP; and the Explorer and Solutions Mapper were involved in the design and execution. What I would have done differently was to engage the explorer and solutions mapper to assess the readiness of the local convergences by scoping the existing practices and methods already being used on the ground. 

> What surprised you?

Although there were an expected handful of local convenors who resisted the introduction of new innovaiton tools, it was pleasantly surprising that most of them expressed openness to try out and learn more about the tools. Moreover, some local convenors themselves had access to locally-generated data whether from their partner-local governments or through members of ther multi-stakeholder networks.
