> Title of the innovation

20 tons per day of Avocados Oil Processing Plant

> Brief description of the innovation

The design of the plant size is for 20 tons per day of Avocados as input substrate
The preferred oil extraction technology is expeller-press technology (also known as, extruder-press or simply press technology). With this technology, the theoretically expected output is 5 tons of crude oil per day

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The plant will cost about $220,000.00 for plant machinery and about US$1.1million for the plant buildings and including administration blocks. With a pay back of approximately US$16.8 million annually, the payback of the business is within two months of operation. 
The constriction works and equipment installations are expected to finish within 7 months, this is inclusive of importation of plant equipment.

> Technical Feasibility

The size of the building is:
Length: 60 m
Width: 20 m
Height: 6.5 m (eave height)
i)	20TPD Avocado Crude Oil Making Machine
▪	Type of machine: Extruder and press technology.
▪	Avocado raw material consumption rate: 833.33 Kg per Hour, 20 tons per day (20TPD).
▪	Power Consumption: less than 90 kWh per ton of raw material Avocado or not greater than 120 kW. 
▪	Extraction rate: 90 – 98 per cent or less than 6 per cent residual content in the de-oil cake.
▪	The expected output of crude oil: greater than 5.3 tons per day (5TPD).

ii)	5TPD Oil Refining Machine
▪	Avocado crude oil consumption rate: 5 tons per day or 5TPD.
▪	Power Consumption: less than 25 kWh per ton of raw material Avocado or not greater than 50 kW. 
▪	Refining Processes: Akali, bleaching and deodorising processes.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The market for avocado oil and the changes in consumer preferences for healthier oils show an increase in consumption and a willingness to pay a premium price (of approximately $10.8 = K170 per litre) for alternatives to the standard oils (Mintel Report 2005 cited by Fletcher, 2006).
The plant will employ youths and trained Engineers and Artisans to work in the plant on permanent basis. A 20T/day plant will require about 200 permanent employee. The spill over effect is enormous ready market to the farming community, transporters, marketers and retailers. The plant has ability to contribute a minimum of about US$16.8 million on annually from the exports of Avocado products to USA, EU which account to 52 and 48 % avocado market respectively. Notwithstanding the low hanging market from AGOA which has a potential of over 152Biliion for Africa alone.
The Forex coming in from the Avocado value-added exports will have immediate positive social economic impact at family level and national level if exploited and financed. We can start this project by investing in our newly formed corporative, Citrus Growers Multi-purpose Cooperative society limited, Registration Number- 420210090404.
