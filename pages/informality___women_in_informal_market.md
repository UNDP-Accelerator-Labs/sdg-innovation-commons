## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Informality - Women in Informal Market
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Empower, Adapt & Innovate women on informal sector so that we can create a more resilient, more inclusive, and more equal society

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The female population, despite being a majority in our country, does not fulfill this same characteristic in the labor market. And their insertion is more precarious, occupying most of the informal jobs and, therefore, taking more risks and less access to social protection for individuals and their families. This same class, Informal Workers, known as "rabidantes", which occupies a large part of the market in Cidade da Praia, has a low level of education and, consequently, low financial literacy and digital skills that can support, sustain, and expand their Business.   Unlocking the potential of these women, empowering them, acquiring skills in Financial and Business Management and Digital Skills can broaden the horizons of the business, and be a change in the lives of each of them and their families.

With the pandemic, this class was very affected, women who go out on the street every day to earn a living for their family were prevented from doing so, incurring a situation of extreme crisis. Despite the resumption of life at levels closer to normal, we continue to have restrictions, the risks of contagion remain and the risk of having to stay at home is not entirely ruled out.  They must become more resilient!    -       There was a total of 30.000 Women in need of urgent support during pandemic. – UNPD data  -       Women employment rate is 5 points of percentage higher than men. – INE data  -       On informal sector the average total monthly remuneration is 29,600 ECV, of which 26,268 among women and 36 723 among men, which is equivalent to a difference of 10 455 ECV. – INE data    http://ine.cv/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mulheres-e-homens-em-cabo-verde-factos-e-numeros-2017.pdf    https://caboverde.un.org/pt/52224-covid-19-atencao-especial-aos-trabalhadores-do-sector-informal-desafios-globais-exigem

There was a total of 30.000 Women in need of urgent support during a pandemic. – UNPD data      As in so many countries, prove the situation on vulnerability or urgent need of financial support was very difficult for women in the informal sector.     It is necessary to instruct the importance of social protection for them and their family.    The formalization of business is crucial for financial adaptation and elevation. Only with formalization is it possible to access the right tools. For this reason, the issue of formalization is fundamental to a process of elevating Financial Literacy.    The Cape Verdean market already has numerous tools that can change the lives of these women, the banking sector has adapted products, microcredit institutions can support growth, and society is adapted to digital commerce. These women may have the opportunity to be in the market differently, more resilient, and more competitive by innovating.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We want to test a Financial Literacy pilot project. This will help us to analyze the outcome of a small group of women, implementing some strategic training modules, and helping them to formalize (if they agree) so that we can see what the impacts are on their lives.    The difference between the action of the laboratory and the other portfolios is that we will do it on a small scale, with a lot of attention to adaptations to training, with a focus on changing the lives of those who are in this process.    With this approach, we believe that we can reach better learning on how to act with the target in question, applying limited resources of time and money.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Financial education will enable you to train with the right tools for a more balanced financial management, the use of modern and accessible management and payment tools and to be closer to customers, we believe it is the key to being more resilient.
