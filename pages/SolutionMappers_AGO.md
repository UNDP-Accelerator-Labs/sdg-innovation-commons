[[ai_summary:Eneida Lima, a solution mapper from Angola, discussed her work with the UNDP Zimbabwe office. She and her team conducted a situation analysis on employment in Angola, bringing together partners like European Union, World Bank, and ILO to understand the country's challenges and potential entry points for collaboration. They used innovative tactics such as sense making and gamification to engage stakeholders and facilitate discussions. Lima noted that sharing responsibilities among partners is crucial to achieving results, as a single agency or partner may not be able to drive progress without the others. By working together, they aim to overcome Angola's complex employment situation.]]

# "Angola's Future of Work Initiative: Mapping Partnerships for Employment Growth"

### [[0:01]] Hi, my name is Charlene Moyo\. I work at the UNDP Zimbabwe office\. Please state your name and your position and which country you're from\.

Hi, I am Eneida Lima\. I'm from Angola Country office\. I am a solution mapper\.

### [[0:24]] OK\. In terms of the work that you have done, tell us about the journeys that you faced at the Angola office with the work you do\.

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Well, regarding R&D I think we have an experience that we are start working in our portfolio call it future of work because the situation of employment in Angola, it's very complicated\. Let's see if that's the youth employment is very high, the informal economy states more than 80%\. So we are trying to figure out what we as UNDP are doing and also our the other UN agency and other partners are doing to over to help the government to overcome this situation because now they are talking about diversified economy because up to now the country economy is more based on air, oil and gas\. So now they are trying to push more for agriculture for tourism and other sectors\. So what we start to do last year is to put together some partners and trying to understand to do a situation analysis about the employment OK\. So we bring some partners like European Union to World Bank, Jack US ID, some agency like ILO, FAO\. We UNDP also and we sit together to try to understand the situation of the country and what each one of us are doing and to see the commandments called the Commons that we have and also the challenge that each one are facing and see the entry points that we can work together and get better results\. We started this work last year\. We did the 1st meeting and we what we decided to do this every quarter to in each meeting we will tackle one of the one problem regarding the employment, OK\.

### [[3:24]] So in terms of engaging stakeholders, what skills and tactics did you use?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Negotiation]]
I think it's what was good in our case that this is a common problem and it was more easy to engage the partners\. But the fact that when we send the invitation, we send the invitation not just when DP but was when DP with European Union want to do this kind of work together with others, I think was great to get the others involved and to do this kind of meetings requires a lot of time to prepare and the communication skill is also\. I think it's necessary to put all together\. When you send the message, you need to explain how to put the words correctly\. I think it's important and also to engage our representatives, you know to talk with them to explain we need to do that\.

### [[4:48]] Why are the reason that we need to do that?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Well being]]
[[principles:Adaptability]]
[[principles:Cultural adaptability]]
Yeah I think the skill is more communication skills it's more important in this case OK And through the conversations you would have what opportunities did you see coming up\. Well a lot what we realized that we have almost all have the same problems we face the same problems to with to work with the government to work together\. It's not easier sometimes we tried but sometimes the the the goals of the mandate of eight each partners it's more important than the work that we should we should do and what we also think it's important that we the insight that we have it's that we have a lot of common work that if we work together we can get more results\. When we look we did this triangle to see what each one are doing\. We see that for example UNDPFAO World Bank are doing the same thing but they are working isolate each one in the air seal\. So maybe we need to start to sit together and the countries will have more results\.

### [[6:30]] OK\. And then in terms of the work you're doing, what do you think were the positive things and then what do you believe you may need to change in terms of how you're approaching it\.

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
I think the doing because normally they the this kind of workshop is it's doing in that traditional way\. So what we did we use sense making, we use gamification, we try to bring some things new for this kind of workshop\. So people are more engaged and you can get more information from them\. And maybe it will be because we are trying to push for that to get not only the UN agency and other development partners but we are trying to push to get the private sector, the government\. I think it's important and could be more rich if you get all those partners together and think together, OK and what would you say you would do differently\. Well, what maybe it's not to what we are realizing now it's if we NDP do not do that, the things will not going forward\. I didn't know yet what we're going to do, but it's try to share responsibilities even that European Union start this kind of thing with us, they do not want the responsibility\. The hard work is it's on us when they pee\. So maybe it's try to give find a way to give them more responsibility that we will share\. So because if a club, because it's most of a club are doing the work if a club do not do the work, this working group will die\. So differently maybe it's try to find a way that to share responsibility\.

### [[9:03]] OK\. Thank you so much\.

Thanks\.
