> Title of the innovation

Integrated Forest Management With Bee Keeping

> Brief description of the innovation

With the prevailing climatic conditions in our area integrating forest and Bee Keeping will reduce the effects caused by climate change, reduce poverty levels, provide nutrition to the community, offer employment opportunities and reduce the emission of green house gasses.

We intend to put about 1000 Bee hives in our forest which will be done in phases of 250 and then process and parkage the honey for selling and then 30% of the profit will be reinvested in the business who'll 15% will be dedicated to help the vulnerable and 20% will be used  for maintenance and 30% will be for payments of workers and logistics while 5% will be for misslenous. 

The residues from the forest will be making compost manure (organic Fertilizer) to support other interprocess in the community.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income by the sale of quality honey, and bin the first in the district to process parkage honey, we have already ripe market locally, and the nearby districts. 
A lot of people in the area are failing to do business due to high temperatures brought about the climate change hence the forest will help in reducing those effects for our community, Bee Keeping will provide employment for the local community and income generation. 

Processing, Packaging and labelling of our products will add more value to the honey and hence attract good return and allow us to compete on the market and with earlier stated business plan the innovation will keep on growing.

> Technical Feasibility

In the 10 hectares land which we have we intend to be cleaning the land and the residues will be used for organic manure and the forest will be managed to house the Bee hives for bee Keeping . 
The innovation will be implemented in phases 
Phase 1
Site survey
Site clearing 
Purchasing or making of 250 Bee hives. 
Phase 2
Restocking and maintenance of the old Bee hives 
Purchasing or making of additional 250 Bee hives 
Phase 3 
Restocking and maintenance of the old Bee hives 
Purchasing or making of additional 250 Bee hives 
Phase 4 
Restocking and maintenance of the old Bee hives 
Purchasing of making of additional 250 Bee hives

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve the lives of the community by providing employment to the community, offer sustainable support to the vulnerable while providing affordable medicinal honey to the community. 

In our local community we have less on no honey producers while processing and packaging will be more attractive to the customers. Hence the inovation is timely and relavant to the community.
