> Title of the innovation

Tree planting,He for she ,reduce reuse and recycling

> Brief description of the innovation

Trees planting is the major project that is going to benefit my town and country Zambia even the nature itsel that includes animals,looking at the population then and now They's a big change looking at now the population has increased compared to then that tells us that we need more trees to have friendly oxygen. 
 The R3 (reduce,reuse and recycle)program will help us to have nice looking environments and many more.
   He for she program is the movement for him to stand for her and treasure the benefits of having a woman in the world that she can do it better just like men do ,especially when it comes to different job positions even women should be involved other thing of the goal he for project is to reduce gender based violence brutalities in relationships etc

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

For tree planting  It will surely benefit many people  if taken it seriously with passion of course they will be challenges here and then if we get to have our own yard and plant varieties of trees,will start selling them in churches schools,malls etc.
  Recycling reuse and reduce I have got a huge move on how to use the used small cocala bottles into bracelets bangles so even that will generate money will start selling start with my town chililabombwe moving to the entire country and even the international levels market.
   He for she will benefit the couples to prosper ,sharing brilliant ideas that can benefit the country with better benefits with the reduced numbers of based violence for that’s more much more that income generating.

> Technical Feasibility

Tree planting 
I will need a position of land with nearly water accessible, we need garden tools and garden outfits gowns 

  R3
The reduce reuse and recycling will need tools like colorful paints,scissors short cutting knives, gloves  maybe that will do for a start.

He for she 
I need to involve some married couples who are having difficulties when it comes to finance I want engage them in business I want to start grocery trading businesses we only need capital I want to make my town independent when it comes to goods purchasing most of the times we travel just because we are a sub town.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovations will bring change to  my town ,my country and the world at large ,the nature it’s self will appreciate even micro insects because of our taking step of tree planting in our country .
   Climate change affects a lot of things like rivers ,animal species even us humans etc and when look at that it’s dangerous when it’s affecting humans health then will have less production power that will affect our economy,less species of animals wild animals will affect us not having most tourists in the country and having problems with water patterns affect many things fishing hydro energy power etc.
   I have got many more to offer many more innovations to come because am looking at the future children ahead of my age that’s why am saying together we can when take step by working together I can’t just do it alone I need support to make a big change.
