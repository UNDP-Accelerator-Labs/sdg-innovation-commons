> Title of the innovation

Simple rain water havesting plant

> Brief description of the innovation

The Rain water havesting mechanism will consist of the colourless transparent flat plate shaped funnel having a whole in the center fixed with a pipe transferring the rain water into a large tank with a tape that can be connected to the hose or irrigation sprayer the havesting of rain water will help farmers control how much rain water their crops receive and also save them from the cost that comes with the use of commercial water supply.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The rain water havesting mechanism will generate income for me as the farmers buy the plant at an affordable price, it will also help farmers save income that goes into the cost of irrigation as rain water is free and will be used at anytime in the amounts desired by the farmer. The target market are the farmers and the general community at large that is interested in rain water havesting for other domestic purposes apart from drinking. The challenge prize will then be used to manufacture and assemble the plant for testing before massive production.

> Technical Feasibility

The design of the rain water havesting plant is simple it should consist of a transparent flat surfaced funnel leading to the pipe that will deposit the rain water into a large tank with a tape connecting to either a hose or irrigation sprayer. It does not have a prototype currently due to the lack of funds and the implementation plan after testing the plan will be through mass innovation education explaining how the plant works and it's benefits.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will come to the aid of; farmers for irrigation, the general public for domestic use aside drinking, and will also prevent flooding as most of the rain water will be collected and put to good use.
