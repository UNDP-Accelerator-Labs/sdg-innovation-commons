## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System thinking methodology could be understandable only by doing it. Sense and Exploration of the portfolio approach help to see the whole picture of the problem. It is important to learn to step out from your comfort zone and learn how to zoom in and zoom out when working with the portfolio perspective -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involvement and collaboration with colleagues from different clusters/projects is crucial – this process of mutual enrichment, shares, and mind-changing -&nbsp; Their expertise and in AccLab new vision -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language of provided information should be clear and easily understandable for colleagues and partners (terminology of system thinking and portfolio approach challenging to accept for partners) -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning is a treasure process, sometimes you gain more by learning than just concentrating on the measurable results – AccLabers understand that but classical projects prefer doing things in the old way -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to make a change to the system and mindsets – be patient, this process make take a long way but it is worth it.

Future of Works in Uzbekistan: Phase 1 - Design FoW portfolio (problem phase and solution phase Phase 2 (during the year 2022) - Designing Options, Portfolio Activation &amp; Dynamic Management&nbsp;&nbsp;
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Uzbekistan faces a set of systemic issues related to employment. Uzbekistan suffers from high unemployment, informality in the labor market, low productivity, the mismatch between supply and demand, dire needs in improving the education system, untapped potential in sustainable resource usage lack of diversified approach, etc. With that, we want to identify entry potential points for systemic impact leveraging the distinct capabilities of UNDP and its key partners. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For Phase 1, AccLab in collaboration with UNDP Uzbekistan colleagues (three UNDP clusters) worked on designing the FoW portfolio by using a system thinking approach. Problem and Solution stages of the process, helped us identify the Intent of the FoW portfolio (stated determination to design the Portfolio of Discovery and Strategic Options to coherently move towards the outcome);&nbsp;Areas of Potential Interest (where the system finds its energy to attract resources and actors to engage. S), and Positions (who are the best target groups to tackle the challenges of the employment issues in the country) &nbsp; For Phase 2 (during the year 2022) we will continue closely working with UNDP colleagues, as well as national partners. AccLab will try to design Options in each Area of Interest, and look for the best possible interventions globally and locally, what projects, programs, actors play an important role in the areas of Digital Labour Market, Social Resilience, and Green Transition in the connection to the Future of Works. This Phase will also include&nbsp;Portfolio Activation &amp; Dynamic Management process.&nbsp;

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

A low labor participation rate Uzbekistan’s relatively low labor force participation rate is one of the main risks to future economic growth. The economically inactive population (including discouraged youth) accounted for approximately 25 %of the total working-age population in 2016. The engagement of women in the labor market also remains low. The share of women in the labor force is around 40%. Predominantly women are concentrated in certain areas like education or health and are effectively excluded from some other areas. Under usage of talent of the youth and women, may seriously hinder prospects of positive qualitative transformations and preparation of the country for the future of work.&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, the exclusion of these groups is related to a plethora of social problems like domestic violence, youth crime, and others.&nbsp; Unorderly migration, brain drain - Leveraging changes in the changing nature of the work and situation in the labor markets will require effective usage of all available “resources”, including human capital. Currently, the Uzbek economy can’t provide jobs for the available workforce resulting in an oversupply of labor resources. About 2 million migrants work in Russia, which hosts about 90% of all Uzbek migrants.&nbsp;Usually, migrants are young and energetic people - thus the quality of the labor force is negatively affected, we also lose a chance to involve them in targeted professional reskilling/upskilling programs.&nbsp;The main destination of migrants is currently Russia where migrants work in low-skilled positions in construction, utility service, transportation, and foodservice industry.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this limits the possibilities for useful technology and skills acquisition by migrants which can benefit Uzbekistan after their return.&nbsp; Incomplete education reforms - understanding and attaining the skills that will be required in the future is critical to building the future of work we want to see and to be prepared for transformations. The education system of the country is in desperate need of reforms to become adaptive, responsive, and effective. Especially in professional training and tertiary education.&nbsp;Quality of education is a fundamental enabler of progressive changes. Outcomes related to the risk of an inadequate education system are a deficit of high and mid-skilled specialists, increased skills mismatch, limitation of the growth of science, research, and innovations ecosystems, and deterioration of cadre quality, including in governance and key institutions. Limiting infrastructure - Interruptions in physical infrastructure result in significant losses in potential manufacturing in Uzbekistan. By improving infrastructure services, the authorities can increase both outputs per worker and employment in firms. On the other hand, developed communications and IT infrastructure is critical for the development of industries and job creation in line with the technological changes of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Failure to create an enabling physical infrastructure will undermine attempts to create leading industrial nodes and create enough jobs.&nbsp; Opportunities for urbanization can also be unlocked by providing infrastructure, especially in smaller cities.&nbsp; Insufficient investments (including public, private and foreign) will not allow the development of an enhancing infrastructure. However, investments, especially foreign investments, are valuable because they stimulate the import of know-how and innovations and the adoption of higher standards. Governments' limited means would also tie their hand in implementing targeted stimulation initiatives thus decreasing the efficiency and scope of policy measures.

From the figure below we can see that a large % of the population belongs to the informal sector, which also includes migrant workers, women, young unemployed groups. Looking for a job outside the country for many families brings a lot of negative impacts, for example, family separations, unsafe working environment, absence of any benefits, etc.&nbsp; There is a lot of gap among women and the labour market, where economically active females do not have stable, financially sufficient jobs,&nbsp;

Climate change - The economy of Uzbekistan is very dependent on agriculture. The share of agricultural output in GDP is about 25% of GDP and it employs 23% of the total active labor force. At the same time, almost 50% of the total population lives in rural areas. Climate change intensifies the desertification process and decreases water resources, leading to reduced biodiversity. The biodiversity of the Aral Sea, for example, has been greatly reduced. An increase in the frequency of natural disasters is a potential issue for Uzbekistan. Estimates show increases in the number of mudflows and avalanches are expected up until 2050. Irrigated farming forms the base of agricultural production. Consequently, Uzbekistan uses approximately 90 percent of surface water for irrigation. Lack of water resources and land degradation are currently threatening the productivity of this sector. Increasing air temperatures associated with global warming pose a significant threat to this sector, reducing the available water for irrigation. The effects of climate change may have a serious impact on the agricultural sector. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; COVID-19 pandemic and other health crises - COVID-19 pandemic has shown some hidden potential regarding the resilience and flexibility of the labor markets at the same time boosting the growth of some areas such as online retail, delivery services, online education, etc. On the other hand, the pandemic also showed vulnerabilities of the job markets, social protection system, a large share of informal employment, and how pandemics can, in fact, exacerbate existing systemic challenges. ILO estimates that net job loss in Uzbekistan might be from 155 to 357 thousand.&nbsp;The unemployment rate increased sharply from 9.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 to 15 percent in the second quarter. External borrowing has sharply increased. However, the full extent of the consequences of the current pandemic will be felt years ahead and it will be definitely a key factor in shaping the future of work in Uzbekistan.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rise of automation and other 4th Industrial Revolution technologies - The rise of automation and other technologies globally, may on one side give an opportunity for Uzbekistan to adapt and harness the benefits, but it can also catch the country unprepared and disrupt the evolution of the labor markets and progress in attainment of its development goals. Today, technological change automates jobs, gives rise to the platform economy, and erodes medium-skilled occupations created by the earlier wave of technological change. In our interviews, this has been noted as both a challenge and an opportunity.&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently Uzbekistan’s economic comparative advantage largely mainly builds on the low labor costs and relatively cheaper energy. But as automation, robotics, and other associated technologies evolve, Uzbekistan’s edge on cheap labor may gradually diminish. Another, probably even more important, effect of automation and technological advancements is that they not only alter the demand-supply balance but also change the characteristics of the labor markets by influencing the set of demand skills, social norms, bargaining power of the sides, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab at UNDP Uzbekistan is aimed to design and present the first portfolio on the Future of Works based on system thinking approach in the country during the time when the government pointed out that one of the main issues at this moment for the country, economy, and society is the issues of employment, especially among the young generation, women and informal workers.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; During Phase 2, (during the year 2022) AccLab will try to go further by taking another step forward in designing Options (accurate possible interventions) by including different actors and stakeholders, national and private partners. As well as&nbsp;Portfolio Activation &amp; Dynamic Management that will be led by&nbsp;UNDP based on its expertise and reputation.&nbsp;

They are agile in responding to the changes in the labor market by offering specialized/niche courses as soon as there is minimal demand. They are also popular as de-institutionalized&nbsp;or add-on options to complement traditional education providers (schools, universities, professional colleges). &nbsp;&nbsp;Education/vocational centers market is very dynamic. Could support with capacity building programs in future skills and future jobs, improving business skills to be financially viable in the internal market. We can also help them to improve the content of their courses in the most demanded future skills.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Collective intelligence - directly links to the designing portfolio by collecting resources from the different intelligence groups (for example during workshops with colleagues of UNDP from different clusters and projects). Collaborative work on the issues of Future of Works will be spotted from different angles, expertise, opinions, and perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowdsourcing - will be conducted through the stage of interviews with different stakeholders and by using the survey to identify main aspects of the Future of Works issues, challenges on employment, current situation, needs, resources the country has at this point&nbsp;&nbsp; System thinking - will help us to design a portfolio and see all aspects from different perspectives and angels, to see the whole structure and cycles of the system, instead of having the classic projects that are aimed at resolving only narrow issues&nbsp;&nbsp; Visual Thinking and Mapping - in order to visualize ecosystems, partners, stakeholders, and other aspects of the portfolio Sensemaking - in order to deal with complex situations, we need to see the whole picture of the projects, solutions in order to start the design of the portfolio&nbsp;

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through interviews with different personas/actors, we will identify main aspects of following areas that relates to the Future of Work: needs, resources, conditions, insights from the different perspectives. For example interviews could be conducted with actors from the government (ministries) level, educational sector ( international/government universities), UNDP colleagues, private sector representatives, NGOs, etc. With that when creating portfolio we will have different overview of the problem and it will help portfolio to be more diverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This collaborative work of AccLab and colleagues from UNDP projects can bring possible growth of the portfolio:&nbsp; &nbsp;- UNDP CO in Uzbekistan could use this portfolio with future identified positions and possible interventions in addressing issues on employment in the country. This could be done through different interventions, as well as by advocating and presenting to the government the portfolio in addressing Future of Works and efficient ways to tackle the issues of employment, especially among youth, informal workers, and young women.&nbsp; This is a great opportunity to involve and collaborate with the private sector, public institutions, youth, IT sector. The biggest beneficiaries - youth, informal workers, women, academia, private sector, Ministries, and other public organizations.&nbsp; &nbsp;
