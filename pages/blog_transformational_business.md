Disclaimer:

The goal of this report is to showcase best
practices and business models that contribute to
the achievement of the Sustainable Development
Goals. It does not encapsulate the entirety of
the contributions of the private sector. Also, the
reported investments are only based on disclosed
information and may vary in timelines. These
models, however, are able to give us an idea on
where companies are concentrating their efforts
on and where we need more infusion of capital.

Most initiatives presented in this report began
before the UN launched the SDGs in September
2015. Their inclusion indicates that the private
sector was already in the business of sustainable
development even before its aspects were
formalized into the SDGs.

over 1,000 CEOs interviewed from around the
world “believe the SDGs provide an opportunity
to rethink approaches to sustainable value
creation,” with 70% seeing the SDGs as providing
“a clear framework to structure sustainability
efforts.” And we are seeing that these beliefs
are increasingly being put into practice. For
example, the World Business Commission on
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) found that
more than 50 of its 163 members worldwide are
already reporting publicly on the SDGs.

Recognising the crucial actual and potential
contribution of the private sector in achieving
the SDGs, UNDP Philippines and the Philippine
Business for the Environment cooperated to
produce this publication on the voluntary
reporting of the private sector’s contribution
to the SDGs. Though private sector reporting
and efforts to establish processes for applying
the SDGs are still being developed in the
Philippines, the report highlights a range of
interesting initiatives of some companies .
These cases can serve as an inspiration to other
enterprises.

We hope this will be the first in a series of
annual reports. We envision that succeeding
publications will encourage more companies to
be involved – from large enterprises to medium,
small, micro and even start-ups. We also hope
that these annual reports will be complemented
by annual forums that facilitate exchange of
knowledge and experiences and the collective
identification of obstacles and innovative
solutions to accelerate the achievement of the
SDGs. Drawing on the numerous resources
for business action on the SDGs, we hope
this annual publication and forums can assist
companies to maximize their contribution to
the SDGs by helping them to: better understand
the SDGs; clearly define their priorities; help
set goals; support integration of the SDGs into
core business practices; and advance robust
reporting and communication of achievements.

As UN Secretary-General António Guterres
recently noted, the private sector is critical to
achieving the SDGs: “without the private sector
we will not have the necessary innovation, we
will not have the necessary capacity to discover
new markets, new products, new services and to
be able to develop new areas in the economy…
and it is only the private sector that can create
enough jobs to stabilize societies”.

We thank all the firms that have contributed to
this report and look forward to strengthening
our partnership for the SDGs, for secure,
sustainable and inclusive development in the
Philippines.

MESSAGE FROM UNDP

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), is unquestionably ambitious and
transformative. It is a global commitment to end
extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice
and act against climate change. If achieved, it
promises to shift the world onto a sustainable
path. Achieving the Global Goals requires the
participation of all. It is not just the responsibility
of government; the private sector and civil
society also have critical roles to play.

The Better Business, Better World report
published earlier this year by the Business and
Sustainable Development Commission found
that additional value of up to $12 trillion per
annum globally can be realized in four economic
systems: food and agriculture; cities; energy and
materials; and health and well-being. This “SDG
dividend” should not be viewed only in terms
of potential profit but also the opportunity
to deeply integrate sustainable development
concerns into core business processes. This
requires a willingness to determine how
commercial practices and business functions
can contribute to attaining the SDGs, such as
through sourcing, employment, tax practices
and corporate strategy. It also requires
examining production processes so they
become more sustainable. In short there is a
need to explore new business models that to
a greater degree align business agendas with
societal aims. The question is not whether
companies should position relative to the SDGs,
but how they should do so.

A recent survey by the UN Global Compact
shows that the rationale for applying the SDGs
in a business context is clearly recognized by
the private sector. The survey found that 87% of

MESSAGE FROM THE PHILIPPINE BUSINESS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

The single most important attribute of the
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
is universality. Climate scientists have bared
that all the SDGs are interconnected and it will
take nothing less than the concerted action of
all countries to avert the further degradation
of our social, economic and environmental
situation if we are to have a safe, just and
sustainable future.

We recognize the essential role of the
private sector in achieving the UN SDGs and
the significance of collaborating with the
government and civil society to attain these
at scale. As a Filipino business community,
we are proud to report the highlights of
our contribution to the achievement of the
SDGs. We commend the companies that have
participated in this maiden inventory and we
urgently encourage other companies to do so.

While this publication does not capture the
entirety of the contribution of the private
sector, it gives a glimpse of how business

integrates the sustainable development goals
into their operations and their potential to
assist government in order to achieve the
country’s SDG targets.

This is our first attempt to account for the
SDG contribution of business, and our goals
are threefold: first, to learn and understand
how to best capture the numerous initiatives
of the business sector. Second, to establish
the discipline of measuring what we do,
because only that which is measured can be
improved. Third, to use these representatives
of the business sector to serve as a beacon for
others to follow. Together with our partners,
we will formulate the guidelines to measure
the business contributions and provide a
platform to report these in the next cycle.

We encourage you to share your thoughts and
as you go through the case studies. We hope
you will be inspired to make your own mark in
achieving the SDGs.

Executive Summary

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and its 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) is a universal call
to action to end poverty, protect our planet,
and guarantee that no one is left behind in
our quest for lasting peace and prosperity.
The SDGs build on the accomplishments
of the Millennium Development Goals and
expand their scope to include climate change,
economic inequality, innovation, sustainable
consumption, and peace and justice, among
other key concerns.

Adopted by 193 UN Member States in
September 2015, the SDGs call for urgent
global action among all sectors across
the globe. They are integral parts of one
cohesive vision and are thus connected
and interrelated—the pathways toward the
success of one embody corresponding courses
of action for the success of another.

THE ROLE OF BUSINESS

According to UN Secretary-General António
Guterres, “Without the private sector we will
not have the necessary innovation, we will not
have the necessary capacity to discover new
markets, new products, new services and to
be able to develop new areas in the economy,”
He also added that only the private sector can
create enough jobs to stabilize societies.

The large scale of the SDGs’ ambition and the
breadth and depth of their collective vision
require massive funding. This in turn requires
all sectors to be collaborative and innovative
in pursuing solutions, with the private sector
taking the lead. According to UN report
calculations, the returns on investments that
can be generated by the full implementation
of the SDGs would mean something in the
order of magnitude of $30 billion per year. As
such, partnerships with the business sector
are attractive for both sides, generating

investment for the private sector but allowing
the private sector “to play an absolutely
essential role in making sure that those goals
are effectively achieved.” A new platform of
partnerships would not only aid the current
goals, but address the challenges of the future.

Businesses are now seen as a leading catalyst
for social and environmental progress as they
have the capital, platform, technology, and
resources needed to deliver innovative and
sustainable solutions at scale. At the same
time, the goals present a great opportunity
for businesses to win new markets and
reinvent the very concepts of profitability and
entrepreneurship through the lens of inclusive
progress.

According to the Better Business, Better World
Report, companies pursuing strategies aligned
with the Global Goals could open economic
opportunities across 60 “hot spots” worth up
to US$12 trillion and increase employment by
up to 380 million jobs globally by 2030. Asia
represents 40 percent of the global value and
nearly two-thirds of total jobs.

UNDP-PBE ONLINE PORTAL
FOR THE SDGS

To hone the discipline of reporting within
the context of the SDGs, the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the
Philippine Business for Environment (PBE)
launched a pilot online portal in September
2016.

This pioneering platform enables companies
to report on their unique sustainability
strategies and business initiatives with an end
goal of narrating past achievements, while
sharing best practices and inspiring more
innovation and action towards achieving the
SDGs.

TRANSFORMATIONAL BUSINESS

The portal and the succeeding report aim to
institutionalize a mechanism through which
the contributions to sustainable development
of private companies—regardless of size,
portfolio and industry—can be systematically
documented and recognized.

OUR DEBUT REPORT

This report is the first of its kind in the country.
It showcases the preliminary results of the
online portal’s survey on how businesses
are aligning their core business processes,
activities, and initiatives with the SDGs.

The narratives presented here are based on
actual contributions and desk research. It
highlights 139 initiatives from 75 reporting
companies, of which 40% are voluntary
submissions through the portal and 60% are
sourced from publicly-disclosed information
through desk research.

Most of the initiatives presented here began
before the SDGs were launched. Their inclusion
reminds us that the private sector was already
in the business of sustainable development
even before its tenets were formally articulated
into the 17 Global Goals.

Based on the submitted initiatives with
disclosed investments information, a total of
Php 40.7 billion have already been invested
in SDG-aligned core business practices and
programs in the Philippines. Ninety-eight
percent of the total disclosed investments are
initiatives for SDG 11 (Php 13.7 billion), SDG 4
(Php 11.3 billion), SDG 7 (Php 7.5 billion), and
SDG 3 (Php 7 billion).

The most number of reported initiatives are
on SDG 12 on Sustainable Consumption
and Production with 24 initiatives and Php
88.6 million of disclosed investments. They

contribute to solid waste management (which
includes e-waste and hazardous waste), water
efficiency and conservation, sustainable
packaging and production, and green
procurement.

This cluster is closely followed by initiatives
that contribute to SDG 8 (promote sustained,
inclusive and sustainable economic growth,
full and productive employment and decent
work for all) with 21 reported initiatives and
Php 141 million of disclosed investments. The
reported initiatives focus on employment
to disadvantaged sectors, skills training for
employment, connecting communities and
MSMEs to wider markets and opportunities,
microfinance for MSMEs, and capacity building
and financial-literacy advocacy.

THE WAY AHEAD

The challenge for the private sector is to
move away from thinking and operating
in silos, towards a truly inclusive and
sustainable approach to doing business.
Beyond philanthropy and corporate social
responsibility, we will continue to encourage
businesses to actively work for the SDGs in
a way that also attracts fresh investment
streams, enhances their profitability
and ensures inclusive and sustainable
development.

Already, the initiatives in this report show
that companies can align profit with purpose.
We will therefore use the next editions of
this report as a solid platform for recognizing
the private sector’s potential and capacity
in accelerating achievement of the SDGs. In
doing so, we hope to better shape market
forces that will enable SDG contribution to
gain more traction and scale in the next few
years.

Introduction & Overview
on SDG Initiatives

The Global Goals present new and exciting
business opportunities for long-term growth,
embracing sustainability and ensuring
wider benefits for society. Achieving these
would create a future that is equitable
and ecologically balanced while being
economically prosperous and inclusive.

According to the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD), achieving
the SDGs would unlock USD 12 trillion a
year globally in business value across four
economic systems alone. These are energy
and materials (USD 4.3 trillion), food and

agriculture (USD 2.3 trillion), cities and urban
mobility (USD 3.7 trillion), and health and well-
being (USD 1.8 trillion).

At no time in the history of commerce has
the private sector played such a clear and
crucial role in achieving both lasting social,
economic, and environmental good at such a
large scale. By the end of the SDGs in 2030, we
believe that some of our best enterprises will
be those who can address our most pressing
global challenges today, and through the most
inventive and inspiring ways.

NO ONE
LEFT BEHIND

It is no coincidence that the Global Goal to eliminate poverty is the very first
of the 17 SDGs. People and our communities—the health, well-being, and
inclusion in societal processes of every person in the planet—are at the center
of the 2030 Agenda.

To successfully reach the rest of the goals on the environment and achieve
lasting prosperity and peace, no person should be left behind on our onward
push to a sustainable world. This means achieving zero incidences of poverty
and hunger, as embodied in SDGs 1 and 2.

The next three goals on people, SDGs 3, 4, and 5, seek to ensure healthy lives,
quality education for all, and gender equality and the empowerment of all
women and girls.

These first five goals are interdependent and invaluable to our collective
aspiration to halt environmental destruction, stop climate change, and realize
a truly sustainable planet in the next decades.

Eliminating poverty is a precondition to
sustainable development and is largely
dependent on social inclusion. This is precisely
why the Sustainable Development Goals, i.e
SDG 8, call for the creation of decent jobs and
inclusive economic growth—areas where
businesses clearly play pivotal roles.

Moving away from aid as the primary source
of development funding, the SDGs now focus
on broad-based economic solutions and
the creation of equitable opportunities to
lift our poorest out of poverty. In this light,
every company, no matter the size, has the
potential to make significant contributions to
our collective goal to eradicate poverty in all
its forms.

Unprecedented economic growth at an
average of 6.1% from 2010 to 2016 has
enabled the Philippines to reach a high
employment rate of 95.3% as of December
2016. Net foreign direct investment inflows,
moreover, has reached $6.2 billion in early
2016.

In spite of these advances, significant gaps
and inequities in income brackets continue

to persist, especially between urban and rural
communities and among men and women. As
of 2015, poverty rates in the country decreased
to 21.6% from 25.2% in 2012. However, this
means that one in every five Filipinos or 21.9
million Filipinos were poor in 2015.

The prevalence of poverty presents massive
opportunities for the entire local business
sector. These include developing products
and services tailored for the poor and granting
them improved access to basic necessities,
including them into the supply chain, as well
as opening employment opportunities for
them. By including the poor into the economy,
businesses will enlarge their market base while
giving a better chance for more Filipinos being
lifted out of poverty.

In addition, businesses also stand to benefit
from the need for new product concepts,
a larger talent pool, a healthier and more
productive workforce, and lower healthcare
costs, among other areas of business growth.

This section presents local examples of
how companies benefit from their efforts in
bringing Filipinos out of poverty.

SDG Targets Being Addressed

End poverty in all its
forms everywhere

1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular
the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic
resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and
control over land and other forms of property, inheritance,
natural resources, appropriate new technology and
financial services, including microfinance.

1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those
in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and
vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other
economic, social and environmental shocks and disaster.

Achieve gender equality
and empower all women
and girls

5.a Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to
economic resources, as well as access to ownership and
control over land and other forms of property, financial
services, inheritance, and natural resources in accordance
with national laws

End hunger, achieve food
security and improved
nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture

2.1 By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people,
in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations,
including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all
year round.

2.2 By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including
achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on
stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and
address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant
and lactating women and older persons.

2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and
incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women,
indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers,
including through secure and equal access to land, other
productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial
services, markets and opportunities for value addition and
non-farm employment.

Private Sector Initiatives against
POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY,
AND GENDER INEQUALITY

SUPPORT FOR FARMERS

Using the power of entrepreneurship in
innovating constantly and moving strategically,
businesses in the Philippines can find a host
of exciting opportunities in growing our
agricultural sector, which for so long has stayed
as one of the country’s poorest performing
sectors.

This sector has an annual average GDP
contribution of only 10% from 2013 to 2015
and its average annual labor productivity
growth has stayed at only 2.9% in the last
three years—the lowest growth rate among all
sectors.

The vast opportunities in finding sustainable
business solutions in this sector become more
apparent with these numbers:

•

•

75% of the country’s poorest work in
agriculture

30.4% of the entire labor force earn less
than half of the current minimum wage
(P251– P454 per day) belong to the
farming community.

Given these challenges, a good number
of businesses in the Philippines are now
responding directly to specific agricultural
issues, while simultaneously driving in business
income.

Nestlé Philippines, Aboitiz Equity Ventures
(AEV), and Century Properties Group (CPG)
are banking on the growth of local produce,
as well as local sourcing from poor farming
communities, to push their business agenda
forward in line with the SDGs.

Nestlé has a sustainable coffee farming
program, called the NESCAFÉ Plan, which
assists farmers to increase their local coffee
production and works towards sustainable
local supply of Robusta coffee. The Company
does this through training, connecting farmers
to agronomists, distributing high-quality coffee
plantlets and providing a ready market for local
farmers. In the last 3 years, 33,676 farmers have
been trained and a total of 6,848,708 plantlets
have been distributed through government
partners. In the last 3 years the company has
steadily increased its local purchase of robusta
coffee. In 2016, the company bought 165%

more local robusta coffee compared to its

CPG’s new business, Palawan Supercorn
Development Corp., has implemented
innovations to reduce imports and meet the
increasing demand for yellow corn feedstock
by growing the crop locally. AEV’s agribusiness
subsidiary, Pilmico Foods Corporation, has
a program called Mahalin Pagkaing Atin
(literally, “love your own food”) which supports
local backyard raisers (swine & poultry)
by providing them with tools to ensure
sustainable livelihoods while also promoting a
“pride of place, pride of product” mindset for
both consumers and raisers.

All the cited strategies are able to strengthen
their companies’ respective supply chains,
while promoting sustainable farming
practices, augmenting the income of small-
scale farmers, and encouraging partners and
customers to support local produce.
Energy firms Pilipinas Shell Petroleum
Corporation (PSPC) through its social arm

Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. (PSFI) and
Energy Development Corporation (EDC),
are focusing on livelihood training and
capacity-building support for farmers as a
way to improve the living conditions of poor
communities living near their project sites.

Aside from enlarging the sustainable energy
business in the Philippines, EDC has been
actively inculcating the value of sustainable
livelihood by introducing its framework
anchored on the transformation of a livelihood
project to a business enterprise and creating
self-sustaining communities. To date, six of its
eight cooperatives are now operating under a
Zero-Livelihood Budget where they no longer
receive financial assistance from EDC but
the company continues to provide technical
assistance and social interventions.

Similarly, PSFI is reaching out to marginalized
farmers (SHELL Saka) and indigenous peoples
(SHELL ISIP) to spur economic growth
through farming and other related livelihood
programs.

of agricultural concepts to generate sizeable
shareholder returns.

Through fund-sourcing and multi-sectoral
partnerships with the government and educational
institutions, some of these programs, such as EDC’s
Livelihood Program, have been able to sustain their
initiatives and reach more communities year after
year. Today, EDC has provided livelihood to 104
farmer associations from 47 partner villages across
its project sites.

The use of cutting-edge technologies, including
global positioning systems in agricultural
production for growing corn at CPG’s Palawan
Supercorn, can enrich the know-how of the
country’s farming groups and inspire the use
of more technological innovations as business
competition heightens.

The increasing scale of investments of these
programs, meanwhile, point to the growing
awareness among businesses of the potential

AEV’s “Mahalin Pagkaing Atin” program has
invested over P14.8 million on piglet dispersal,
egg machines and bakery kits to empower
more local raisers & baking enthusiasts since the
program started in 2014.

Century Properties has invested P202 million in
growing its Palawan Supercorn businesses with a
target of producing 900,000 metric tonnes of corn
feedstock per year at a competitive price of P11.7
per kilo.

EDC’s Livelihood Program, the longest-running
initiative in this group, has disbursed over P270
million over a 12-year period starting 2005.
Having livelihoods, forest communities avoided
encroaching the forests. This program was key to
the success of the protection of watersheds and
the increase in forest cover by more than 50% for
the past 3 decades, ensuring the sustainability of
its steam supply for its geothermal power plants.

FOOD SECURITY AND CHILDREN

Despite the government’s advances in food
security and nutrition, millions of Filipino
children continue to suffer from stunting.
According to the 2015 Regional Overview
of Food Insecurity in Asia and the Pacific,
approximately 17.5 million Filipinos are still
undernourished and 33.5% of our children
below five years old are stunted (low height-
for-age ratio). This is in stark contrast with the
fact that we are losing P8.4 billion worth of rice
per year, equivalent to each Filipino wasting
about 3.3 kg per year. This amount of rice can
feed 4.3 million people.

In aid of the government’s continued efforts
to achieve better nutrition among children,
multinational giants Nestlé and PSPC are
pursuing new business tracks that address
undernutrition in the communities where
they operate.

PSFI’s Green Schools Program

Nestlé’s Micronutrient Fortification program,
for instance, is now a core business strategy
and a profit driver of the company’s operations
in the Philippines. The program fortifies
strategically positioned products with vitamin
A, zinc, iron and iodine. These products, such
as the popular BEAR BRAND milk, are available
in small pack sizes to make them more
accessible to low-income groups.

Complementing this fortification drive is
Nestlé Healthy Kids, in partnership with the
Department of Science and Technology – Food
and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI).
This program is an unbranded program that
promotes healthy eating habits, through fun
interactive sessions, by including nutrition
into the curriculum of targeted schools in
vulnerable communities and highlighting the
importance of reading food labels to school
children. The program measures increase in
knowledge, attitude and behavior.

Education, is PSFI Green Schools Program.
This community development initiative
targets PSPC’s fenceline communities—
these are neighborhoods adjacent to PSPC’s
plants’ areas of operation. In keeping with
its principle of good corporate citizenship
and discovering that most of its fenceline
communities face problems related to
malnutrition, PSPC, through PSFI’s Green
Schools Program integrates urban gardening,
nutrition, and waste management into the
subjects of select grade schools.

The results of these programs have been
encouraging. Nestle’s Micronutrient
Fortification program—a good example of
how to address a crucial health challenge
through a core business strategy—has
been able to contribute to decreasing the
prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in
vulnerable groups. The company achieved this

while increasing its market share and selling
around 22 billion servings of fortified products
in 2016.

Nestle’s Healthy Kids has so far reached
5,289 grade-four students in sixteen schools
from 2013 to 2016 with continued plans
for expansion. The program also showed
significant increase in knowledge, attitude and
behavior scores.

PSFI’s Green Schools has reached three
schools, trained nine teachers, and addressed
the needs of 90 pupils suffering from severe
wasting or low weight-for-height ratio. Both
programs are also good public-relations
tools that strengthen their respective
brands. Sustaining these programs at scale
and forging more partnerships are the next
challenges these programs will face towards
greater shared values for more people.

In spite of a high gender development
index of 0.977, gender inequality remains
pronounced in the Philippines, particularly
in terms of labor participation and levels of
income.

This is evident in the estimated GNP per capita
of the country’s female population, which is
still only 50% of the GNP per capita estimate
for Filipino men. Moreover, the number of
men belonging to the labor sector compared
to women, is still prominently uneven at 79.7%
vs. 51.1%, showing that many women still find
it difficult to enter the formal workforce.

Supporting SDG 5 and the continued
empowerment of women is a sound business
move for any enterprise. This will drastically
increase the private sector’s talent pool, open
doors to fresh ideas and new perspectives,
and inspire large populations of women to
become a productive force for economic
growth.

Nestle’s Cut and Sew project has now grown
to around P1.5 million worth of business
every year at the factory

One example of how a business can achieve
this is Unilever Philippines’ Kabisig Summits
and Super Stores Program. To better
distribute its food, home and personal care
products, Unilever decided to tap the huge
potential of mom-and-pop stores or home-
based retail outlets, also known as sari-sari
stores in the Philippines. Mostly managed
by matriarchs and female family members,
these microenterprises are ubiquitous in
the Philippines and represent one of the
most popular small-business concepts in the
country.

By empowering these micro-entrepreneurs,
Unilever significantly improves its distribution
lines and reaches a wider market base. To
improve the viability of these stores, Unilever
conducts training programs on stock control,
financial management, sales techniques, and
customer service. Around 541,000 sari-sari
store owners, most of which are women, have
attended these summits. Unilever’s goal is to

teach a total of 100,000 micro-entrepreneurs
by 2020.

Another way for companies to extend their
support for marginalized women groups is
by actively finding ways to include them into
their respective supply chains. Nestlé’s gender
empowerment program in Lipa, Batangas,
for instance, has transformed a community
of housewives and jobless women living
near its manufacturing plant into budding
entrepreneurs. Through sewing skills training
and short business courses, these women
in Lipa City are now able to professionally
construct garments and supply uniforms and
other clothing supplies for the company’s
manufacturing needs. The program has also
expanded to three other communities close
to other Nestlé factories. In 2016, the ladies
received over 14 million worth of purchase
orders. The program has also expanded
to a Yard and Garden program which uses
land within the factories of Nestlé allowing
ladies from the community to plant in this
area. The produce is then sold to the factory
canteen and to factory employees, generating
livelihood for the women in the community.

Similarly, PSFI’s MagBuhay (Maghanap-
buhay sa Bahay or “work at home”) and SKP
(Sanayang Kakayahang Pangangalakal or
“improving entrepreneurial capacities”)
has so far empowered over 17,000 idle and
unskilled family members (mostly women) by
creating opportunities for small businesses and
providing training for basic “negosyo” skills.

Other business initiatives include the
partnership of EDC with “Hapinoy” a few years
ago, an NGO that empowered the women
of the host communities of its Bacon Manito
geothermal project in west Sorsogon. Hapinoy
taught the mothers manning “sari-sari” stores
skills on accounting and goods inventory.

These three community-development
programs of Nestle and PSFI are implemented
with the support of the government’s
Technical Education and Skills Development
Authority, private training institutions, local
government units, and various funding
partners. EDC on the other hand partnered
with an NGO, Hapinoy to use the village
store in bringing products and services to
communities.

INSURING THE POOR AGAINST CALAMITIES AND ECONOMIC SHOCKS

The poorest communities in the Philippines are
among the most vulnerable to natural hazards
in the world, considering the number of storms
and calamities that frequently hit the country.

For instance, Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest
storm to hit the country on record, caused an
estimated increase in the national poverty
incidence by 1.9% and 30.5% increase in
severely affected provinces in 2012.

With an average of 20 typhoons each year—
many of which can quickly destroy shanty
towns and informal settlements—some of the
poorest communities in the Philippines are
bound to a cycle of constant struggle year after
year. The Global Climate Risk Index Report of
2017 recorded the highest calamities in the
Philippines from 1996-2015 at 283 events.

This highlights the need for new insurance
platforms that are able to cover more people,
especially workers belonging to the country’s
informal sector, including small-scale business
owners, farmers, fisherfolk, domestic workers,
and other contractual workers.

MICRO-INSURANCE SCHEMES
IN THE PHILIPPINES

Philippine business concepts that are
casting a bright light on the growing space
of micro-insurance are Cebuana Lhuillier
Insurance Solutions and Palawan Pawnshop’s
ProtekTODO acccidental insurance schemes.

Driven by the huge potential of this relatively
new market, and boosted by the government’s
target to insure at least 50% of Filipinos by
2020, these ventures are now able to provide
micro-insurance policies at highly affordable
rates. These include insurance coverages
against natural and man-made calamities,
accidental death, and motorcycling accidents,
among other untoward incidents that threaten
the security of those in the informal sector.

One of the oldest insurers in this field is
Cebuana Lhuillier Insurance Solutions (CLIS),
the micro-insurance arm of Cebuana Lhuillier,
a large non-bank financial services provider in
the Philippines.

Since 1999, Cebuana Lhuillier Insurance
Solutions has covered around 7 million
Filipinos in the bottom of the pyramid

Established in 1999, CLIS is able to use
Cebuana Lhuillier’s extensive pawn-brokering
business, with its 2,000 branches across the
country, as a leverage to insure some of the
poorest segments of Philippine society.

The company now has over 20 unique micro-
insurance products, including its popular
Alagang Cebuana Plus Gold personal accident
insurance which covers Filipinos aged 7 to 70
years old. For as low as P120/year, insureds
can be covered for as much as P20,000 on
accidental death, dismemberment and
disablement, P5,000 fire cash-assistance,
P5,000 micro-life and P5,000 murder and
unprovoked assault. It launched the first
microinsurance-dedicated app called
MicroPinoy, embarked on a nationwide
microinsurance awareness campaign in
the community level and deployed eight
“microinsurance-on-wheels” (vans) to far-
flung rural areas to distribute microinsurance
products.

Pera Palawan’s ProtekTODO accidental
insurance plans are similarly designed to cater
to the informal workforce with premiums that
cost as low as P20 per certificate for a coverage
period of four months.

All these plans are made more accessible to
their target publics by keeping application
requirements to a bare minimum. Some do
not even require any sort of documentation
or medical certification, and most can be
activated using mobile phones and other
innovative digital platforms.

Notably, CLIS has established a program called
CLAIMS RAPIDO (Rapid Action in a Disaster-
Stricken Area Operations). Within 24 hours of
a disaster, the company sends employees to
the affected area to immediately process the
claims of policyholders.

As the oldest company in the pack, CLIS is a
good benchmark of what can be achieved in
scaling up the operations of micro-insurance
schemes in the country. Since 1999, the
company has covered around 7 million

Filipinos in the bottom of the pyramid. It has
disbursed around $180 million in claims since
2004, and reached an annual business growth
rate of 17% in 2015.

Gaps and Opportunities

More and more companies operating in
the Philippines are beginning to realize
that aligning their business goals with
sustainability concerns is in fact good for the
bottom line and their shareholders’ profit
motive.

Most private companies, moreover, need an
economically thriving and healthy population
to succeed. A high incidence of poverty,
coupled with weak food and health systems,
limit business growth and are anathema to
innovation and creativity—two of the building
blocks of entrepreneurial vigor and success.

As evident in the new business models and
livelihood support programs discussed in this
section, investing in agriculture, nutrition,
women, and micro-insurance can lead to
lucrative ventures that also have the power to
lift entire communities out of poverty.

More business solutions like these can be
achieved if companies further align their
efforts with parallel government programs.
For example, agriculture-based companies
may tap government agencies, such as
the Department of Agriculture and the
Department of Agrarian Reform, to explore

financing schemes that are already being
managed by these national government
agencies.

For agriculture support, banks are also
required by RA 10000 or the Agri-Agra Reform
Credit Act of 2009 to set aside at least 25% of
their total loanable funds for agriculture and
fisheries credit. However, in 2015, only 15.22%
was set aside as loanable funds – way below
the 25% floor. A reason for noncompliance is
that banks see the agriculture sector as having
high risk of default. This law may be amended
by determining the absorptive capacity of
financial institutions for agricultural loans
while ensuring that costs for agricultural
production are met. An ecosystem of services
to improve the capacity of farmers to access
financial services is also needed.

Companies may also partner with the
government’s gender empowerment and
family-planning programs to put more women
into the mainstream workforce.

Companies can further assist their beneficiary
communities by linking them to more market
opportunities within and outside their supply
chains.

In the past few years, the Philippines has made
strides in improving health services delivery
across the country. Our life expectancy rate
has increased to 68.26 in 2014 from 67.78
in 2010. Our infant mortality rate is down to
22.2% in 2015 from 24.4% in 2011. Notably,
our National Health Insurance Program (NHIP)
now covers 93 million Filipinos as of 2015. Of
this total, 61 million or around 66% belong to
vulnerable groups.

Philhealth benefits are at their record largest,
they are still insufficient to ensure the financial
security of the poorest in times of dire health
needs.

Our maternal mortality rate as of 2015,
moreover, continues to be at a high 114 deaths
per 100,000 live births—a long way to go
toward our target of 92 deaths per 100,000 live
births.

But despite these advances, our public health
investments still lag behind our Asian and
ASEAN neighbours. As of 2014, public health
spending in the Philippines is only at 4.7% of
our GDP, compared to the 5.2% average of
many ASEAN countries and the 7.7% average
of Japan, China, and South Korea.

The continued high cost of medicine and
medical care, which still drive our poorest
communities to scrimp on basic needs or
totally forego healthcare, further widen these
gaps. As of 2014, 55.8% of the total healthcare
cost was borne by private entities (e.g.
individuals, families). This indicates that while

All these challenges present a host of
opportunities for many enterprising
individuals and groups, especially those
with medical and public health interests and
backgrounds. New pathways to partnerships
and tie-ups between differing sectors may
inspire some of the best solutions we have yet
to see in addressing these persistent health
gaps. Multinational firms, too, with numerous
branches and production plants across the
Philippines stand to enjoy greater public
trust and patronage by integrating the health
concerns of their respective communities and
customers into their business models.

HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR
COMMUNITIES: From Big Energy
Companies to a Small Community-
based Clinic

Companies with power generation plants and
production business operation sites in poor
rural communities continue to recognize the
need to extend health services to members of
their fenceline communities.

Companies such as First Gen Corporation and
Energy Development Corporation (EDC) are
able to fill in some crucial gaps in health-care
through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
programs that provide access to health to
community members.

In partnership with local government health
offices, First Gen conducts health programs
and trains barangay health workers to
immediately respond to community health
needs in remote areas. The company also helps
improve health centers through provision of
infrastructure and equipment.

17,300 Individuals provided with access to
healthcare through First Gen’s CSR Program
for Community Health & Safety

EDC provides health development assistance
projects to health centers in 47 communities
that host its geothermal and wind operations.
The company focuses on three key areas:

a) capacity-building through health center

improvements in infrastructure and
equipment;

b) improved access to basic health services;

and

c) heightened awareness on responsible

parenthood or other health topics.

Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (PSPC),
on the other hand, integrates a medical and
dental mission into the activities of its refinery
in Tabangao to mitigate or prevent any adverse
effects its operations may have on its host
community. While providing free medical
services and improving its reputation, the
company is also able to gather precise medical
information that it can use to study to validate
how their environmental measures are able
to prevent adverse health impacts on the
communities.

Another example of a business-driven
program that targets community health is
Jucone’s Contemporary Physical Therapy
Services (JCPTS). Although much smaller in
scale as a business, this innovative approach
taps the spirit of community collaboration
to create a rehabilitation program that helps
the elderly and children with disabilities.
Using community-based rehabilitation and an
inclusive and sustainable grassroots approach
that links the local government, interfaith
groups, the disabled sector, JCI Marikina
Marikit and immediate community members,
JCPTS has managed to create a viable profit-
based platform to extend effective physical
therapy services to its community in Quezon
City.

All these programs have significantly
contributed to health targets of the SDGs at
the community level. Through partnerships
with government agencies, health units, and
non-profits, EDC and First Gen, for instance,
have trained hundreds of community health
workers, enriched many community health
clinics with much-needed equipment, and
reached out to hundreds of indigent families
by providing medicines. First Gen has so far
invested nearly P28 million in these programs
since 2008, while EDC has already invested
about P100 million since it started pursuing
health CSR programs in 1993.

Konsulta MD

Has over 80,000 active subscribers and
a total of 6,000 successful health-related
consultations since launch in August 2015.

To directly address these challenges, Operation
Smile collaborated with Smart to develop a
web and mobile-based application to screen
more new cases and capture relevant data
remotely. This greatly facilitates the work of
health workers and community volunteers in
helping more patients, especially those in very
remote areas. Ultimately, the group envisions
this tool as the basis for a national cleft registry
in which all marginalized children born with a
cleft lip or palate are promptly identified and
enrolled into a clinical pathway leading to

HEALTH FINANCING
AND IMPROVED HEALTH
TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES

With many of our healthcare facilities in poor
urban and rural communities unable to hire
top-notch practitioners or purchase the latest
medical equipment, many Filipino companies
are responding with business-related solutions
to address this service gap. In the process, they
are able to generate increased social values,
a stronger moral license to operate, and even
enhanced shareholder returns.

With this approach, companies identify
underserved segments in rural markets, finance
health ventures, maximize economies of scale,
and provide underserved areas with medical
equipment and health services for free or at a
reduced cost.

Ayala Healthcare Holdings Inc. (AC Health)’s
new clinics, FamilyDOC, is an example of how
the private sector can augment health services
in underserved areas as a core business
strategy. Development Bank of the Philippines’
health financing scheme, called Sustainable
Health Care Investment Program (SHCIP), is
another shared-value approach that capitalizes
on the bank’s core expertise to improve health
services in areas where it is needed most.

FamilyDOC

has over unique 23,000 unique
patients on record.

FamilyDOC is a new chain of primary care
clinics that brings quality medical services
nearer to communities, at an affordable price.
It is wholly-owned by AC Health, the healthcare
portfolio company of the Ayala Corporation.
FamilyDOC It offers the combined services of
a clinic, a diagnostic facility, and a pharmacy.
Its business proposition is to make quality
healthcare more accessible and affordable to
middle-and lower-middle-class communities.
Services are delivered by trained Primary Care

Physicians, and medical staff, at price points
10-40% lower than other private providers.
households by bringing such services closer to
the targeted communities. FamilyDOC clinics
also utilize an in-house Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) system to securely store medical
information across its clinic network. The
capital requirement to start for a 100 square
meter FamilyDOC clinic is pegged at P6 to P7
million. There are now six of these clinics in the
Greater Manila Area and over 23,000 unique
patients on record. In 2017, FamilyDOC will
open an additional 18 clinics, with the goal of
opening 100 clinics by 2020.

DBP’s SHCIP, on the other hand, serves
entrepreneurs who wish to pursue a similar
community-based clinic business like
FamilyDOC. This innovative and highly strategic
credit facility is meant solely for health sector
projects. In particular, SHCIP grants loans and
credit for working capital requirements, the
construction or renovation of health facilities,
and the acquisition of any equipment or
technological system that improves health
services.

DBP’s timely program is also able to support
partnerships between various sectors, as well
as fresh strategies that work for an integrated
health care delivery system in the country.
The program is accessible to both public and
private sector health initiatives in need of
working capital or additional funds. With DBP
investing a total of P6.8 Billion in the sector as
of June 2016, this program has so far extended
assistance to at least 49 public and private
hospitals. It has also supported a total of 151
health sector projects nationwide and added
at least 490 hospital beds to the country’s
hospital bed inventory. At least 20% of its total
loan accounts are held by small-scale private
providers.

Other notable business programs that are able
to strategically provide medical equipment for
under-served communities are the programs
of Shell Philippines Exploration BV(SPEX) in
Palawan and Philips in Tacloban.

What began as a human resource concern
for SPEX in Palawan has become a larger
community health program that now benefits

TRANSFORMATIONAL BUSINESS
29

even non-employees of SPEX’s Malampaya
Deep Water Gas-to-Power Project. When
the gas project began in 2001, SPEX initially
recognized the lack of medical facilities in
the province to handle accidents and other
urgent medical requirements for its workforce.
In partnership with the Palawan Adventist
Hospital Charity Program, the company
thus provided counterpart funding for the
hospital’s charity program, with a focus
on burns, trauma, infectious diseases and
mother and child care. Today, the program
has expanded to include treatment for
underprivileged and indigenous groups.
Philip’s program called FriendlyCare Birthing
Home and Family Health Clinic in Tacloban is
another example of how a company’s business
activities can result in improved medical
facilities for remote communities. By opting

to donate Philips’ ultrasound, ECG and fetal
monitor equipment to an underprivileged
community, the company was able to
simultaneously market its new products and
address preventable maternal deaths in a
targeted region.

Asian Eye Institute (AEI), a sister company of
First Gen and EDC has a CSR program called
“Bringing Hope to Life: Cataract Surgery
Mission,” since 2011. AEI runs its 100 Eyes
Cataract Surgery Program operating on 100
eyes, contributing to the country’s sustainable
goal of providing healthy lives and wellbeing
among its people. For many indigent patients,
cataract removing for a clear vision is life
changing. Patients can go back to work and
become better members of the community.

PREVENTIVE MEDICINE:
Immunization and Wellness

One area in healthcare that offer a wealth of
opportunities for pharmaceutical companies,
hospitals, and even upcoming health
enterprises is preventive medicine, particularly
immunization and products and services that
promote a healthy lifestyle. With the growing
awareness among Filipinos of the importance
of preventive healthcare approaches, this
business segment is expected to grow in the
coming years.

Between 2011 and 2013 Glovax distributed
1.6 million vaccines, of which over 1.4
million doses were administered to middle
and low income Filipinos

Many Filipino families, for instance, still do not
have access to immunization and vaccines that
can shield their infants from various infections.
The access of the elderly to vaccines, too, can
prevent untimely deaths and is an important
health topic that is now finding support from
private groups. Finding ways to make vaccines
more affordable and easily accessible can
clearly save millions of lives as well as provide
significant returns on investment for those
with the foresight and acumen to compete in
this field.

One example of such a business case is OKs
ang Bakuna Ko Laban sa Pulmonya (“my

vaccine fights pneumonia”), a public-private
partnership between PhilHealth and Merck
Sharp and Dhome (MSD) Philippines. The
program provides pneumococcal vaccination
at discounted rates to PhilHealth Lifetime
Members and their dependents. The
partnership is supported by an information
campaign to educate older citizens about
the great benefits of vaccination to prevent
pneumococcal infections and complications
leading to meningitis and pneumonia. It also
informs younger Filipinos about the benefits
they can enjoy in their senior years if they
continuously pay their premiums, thereby
also strengthening PhilHealth’s financing
campaign.

Another strong entrepreneurial case for
entering into the vaccine business is Glovax
Biotech Corp., a fully integrated vaccine
company in the Philippines that imports,
distributes, and retails a complete line of
vaccines at an affordable price. The company’s
main goal is to improve vaccine access for
middle to low income Filipinos.

According to the company, many of our
current private healthcare providers cater
only to the upper income segment of the
population. By distributing vaccines from
multinational pharmaceutical corporates
(MNCs) to 3,200 community clinics and
hospitals in 20 provinces (many of which do
not have access to vaccinations), the company
brings significant social impact, while growing
its business. Notably, Glovax has administered
over 110,000 vaccines for free since 2003 in
partnership with socio-civic organizations as
a way to market its services. Currently, Glovax

operates three VaxCen (retail) clinics, providing
access to affordable vaccines (priced 25%
less than community clinics) available in the
Philippines. Glovax aims to scale up its impact
by distributing about 3.5 million doses to
middle and low income Filipinos until 2018.

In the area of insurance, meanwhile, PhilAm
Life has found a way to make physical vitality
and healthy lifestyle choices central themes for
one of its insurance programs. In partnership
with Vitality, PhilAm Life launched a wellness
program that rewards policyholders for
making healthy choices. According to the
company, the wellness program is science-
based and it provides members with the

right knowledge, tools, and motivation to live
a longer and healthier life. Using a mobile
app, policyholders are given a set of daily
or weekly challenges to accomplish, such
as “take 7,500 steps per day,” or engage in
“60 minutes of physical activity and burn
at least 300 calories.” Each challenge has
a corresponding number of points which
members can convert into rewards, such as
free taxi rides or discounts to mobile phone
bills and hotel accommodations. To attract
new policyholders, the program is also open to
non-members at a limited scope. As of January
2017, the program has already attracted
50,000 active users.

PROVIDING ACCESS
TO AFFORDABLE
ESSENTIAL MEDICINE

According to the 2014 Philippine National
Health Accounts, out-of-pocket (OOP)
costs comprise 55.8% of the total health
expenditures. Each Filipino spent P5,859 in
2014 for health, an 8.5% increase from P5,400
in 2013. Of this, medicines account for the
highest share among the total health and
medical expenses . A high OOP is damaging to
the health of the poor as it leads to increasing
mortality among the marginalized (Plumper
and Neumayer, 2012) . Therefore, increasing
the accessibility and affordability of quality
medicines is essential in poverty alleviation.

Generika is the pioneer in the retail of quality
generic medicines in the Philippines. From its
beginnings in 2003, it has grown to a network
of over 690 stores, nationwide. Generika
offers customers savings of up to 85% on their
medicines, while still ensuring that medicines
are sourced from reputable local, and
international manufacturers. It carries its own
house brand of medicines, called Actimed,
and wellness products, called Nutrawell.
More recently, Generika has expanded into
providing value-added services, such as
the free Gamot Guide (Medicine Guide),
which gives customers information on the
medicines they purchased, including dosages,
contraindications, and possible side effects. As
part of its advocacy, Generika actively promotes
generic medicines, and rational drug use.

Gaps and Opportunities

New approaches

Two major milestones achieved in public
health financing in the Philippines are the
establishment of PhilHealth through the
National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) in
1995 and the enactment of the Sin Tax Law in
2012, which bring substantial and increased
government revenues, a bulk of which goes to
public health programs. Though this fund has
been used to increase the number of Filipinos
enrolled in PhilHealth, the greater challenge is to
effectively mobilize the money for public health.

Given the bigger budgets that are now
coursed through PhilHealth, the private sector
stands to gain from developing new business
approaches that work for Universal Health
Coverage (UHC) and Primary Health Care
(PHC). The goal of UHC, says the World Health
Organization, is to ensure that all indivdiuals
and communities obtain the health services
they need without suffering financial hardship.
[1] The complementary goal of PHC, on the
other hand, is better health for all by reducing
exclusion and social disparities, organizing
health services around people’s needs,
integrating health into all sectors, pursuing
collaborative models of policy dialogue, and
increasing stakeholder participation.[2]

With the increase in resources for PhilHealth,
the private sector can work with the
government to strengthen the delivery of PHC
and achieve greater UHC coverages. Aside from
focusing on curative care, they could expand
their involvement in the delivery of PHC (e.g.
vaccinations, health promotion, water and
sanitation, etc.). Companies that deliver health
services could work with PhilHealth under
a capitation scheme which can be used to
deliver a package of preventive health services
to a target population.

Possible partnerships

As seen in the partnerships created by the
programs in this section, more companies
stand to benefit from a heightened sense of
cooperation with other companies, as well as
by collaborating with the government and
nonprofit agencies. Through creative linkages,
companies can achieve new synergies,
maximize resources, and cut down on business
costs while expanding their geographical reach.

Following through on its partnership with
Operation Smile, Smart Communications may
for example choose to extend the program to
cover other major illnesses. The company could
work with government to create a database
of rural hospitals or municipalities, along
with their specific needs, such as equipment,
training, etc. This database can be made
available to pertinent government agencies,
sponsor companies, and various donors, as
an avenue to expand UHC and PHC, generate
philantropic interest, new partnerships, and
also attract new Smart subscribers. In addition,
Smart and the hospitals under the MVP Group
can explore innovative tie-ups as they belong
to the same conglomerate.

Glovax, too, may opt to tap FamilyDoc’s
growing network of clinics to distribute their
vaccines, as both companies share similar
social missions. Glovax can also initiate
discussions with PhilHealth to include their
vaccines as one benefit in the NHIP.

More companies can also partner and combine
their internal wellness drives, and share best
practices and pool resources, to promote
better health among employees and achive
significant outcomes at a wider scale.

In terms of scaling up efforts, Konsulta MD has
the strong potential to expand its services by
including video calls in its menu of services.
DBP may enhance its information campaigns to
inform more health-related businesses about
the bank’s innovative financing scheme.

Multinational pharma companies may also
help the government educate the general
public on early detection of sicknesses
depending on their markets and fields of
expertise. This move, in turn, can provide them
with a better sense and understanding of the
dynamics of the Philippine market, aside from
giving them wider publicity mileage and brand
recall.

The business opportunities in providing
quality health services to achieve greater social
inclusion and a more economically productive
population are numerous. In support of the
SDGs thrust to leave no one behind, companies
can design new strategies that specifically
reduce health inequities by actively targeting
the poor and marginalized in innovative ways.

Goals closest to the heart of many businesses
in the Philippines.

scholarships to bright but underprivileged
students. Many also extend educational
loans at minimal interest rates to employees
who have insufficient resources to send their
children to good schools.

Even before the advent of corporate social
responsibility in the country in the 1960s, local
enterprises were already making it a point to
allocate a big fraction of their philanthropic
spending to fund public school infrastructure
and provide scholarships to deserving
students.

This tradition lives on in many companies in
the country and is largely reflective of the
premium Filipinos place on education and its
ability to improve one’s lot in life.

Many companies in the Philippines thus have
institutionalized CSR programs that give out

Beyond the country’s philanthropic tradition
of giving back through scholarships, a good
number of companies are now striking out in
new directions with fresh concepts and more
strategic approaches to achieve wider impact
and scale in education.

Telecommunication companies are parlaying
their investments in technology by using them
as platforms to bridge persistent educational
gaps. Other companies, including some of our
biggest conglomerates, are even establishing
their own schools to make inclusive education
an integral part of their business portfolios.

BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE:
Improved ICT infrastructure and ICT Inclusive Education

As a result of rapid advances in mobile
technology, telecommunication companies in
the Philippines are looked upon by a growing
public as our leading innovators, most capable
to break barriers to learning, communication,
and access to information.

Living up to this role and reputation,
Globe Telecom, Inc., PLDT, Inc., and
Smart Communications Inc., the leading
telecommunications companies in the country,
have further stepped up their efforts to
improve the country’s level of digital literacy,
which is becoming increasingly essential
among younger groups to participate in
social discourse, access digital archives and

resources, and even seek further educational
opportunities and eventual employment.

PLDT, Smart Communications, and Globe
Telecom are also aiming to resolve issues
related to internet access among underfunded
schools. This move is timely as the Philippines
still lag behind foreign counterparts in terms
of internet access ranking of 61 out of 138,
according to the Global Competitiveness
Report 2016-2017. Out of 46,739 public
schools nationwide, only 26% public schools
are connected to the internet. Moreover, about
12% of our public schools still have no access
to electricity.4

GLOBAL FILIPINO SCHOOLS
AND THE DIGITAL THUMBPRINT
PROGRAM

Globe Telecom has programs such as Global
Filipino Schools (GFS) and Digital Thumbprint
Program that help integrate information and
communications technology (ICT) in our public
school systems.

The Global Filipino Schools (GFS) Program is
a long-term partnership of Globe with the
Department of Education which covers two
sustainable interventions that help forward
21st century learning in public schools
nationwide. The GFS Program provides schools
with free internet access, tech devices for
mobile learning (tablets, projectors, mobile
phones, modems, pocket WiFi dongles,
chromecase dongles, virtual reality goggles,
a mobile cart and a mobile charging station),
teacher training on 21st century learning
approaches, and tech integration in the
classroom. From just 1 school in 2012, Globe
currently operates the GFS Program in 135 of
221 DepEd divisions with 142 schools rolled-
out in total, now covering 16 of 18 regions

of the country. Program coverage of all 221
divisions will be achieved as early as 2018.

Digital Thumbprint Program, the cyber-
wellness program of Singtel and Optus in
Singapore and Australia, is a workshop series
for students and teachers on responsible
digital citizenship and cyber wellness. The
workshop series is composed of the following
modules:

• Cyber safety and security;
• Online etiquette and responsibility; and
• Leadership and empowerment through

technology

Each module was designed to increase
students’ digital intelligence to enable well-
informed choices when online. Through
nurturing workshop ambassadors/trainers, the
program has now reached 6,347 public and
private high school students, with 911 public
school teachers empowered to teach the
program to their students. A partnership with
DepEd this 2017, includes a national cascade
to the teacher trainers in all 221 divisions, and
considerations for curriculum integration of the
workshop modules.

SMART TECHNOCART
AND BATIBOT

PLDT and Smart Communications run two
innovative and strategic programs that
enhance the delivery of early childhood
educational services in the country. Targeting
poorly funded kindergartens, Smart’s
TechnoCart and Batibot programs use the
latest gadgets and mobile technology to open
a wealth of learning opportunities to very
young students.

Under the Smart TechnoCart program, each
beneficiary school receives a ‘technology-cart’
containing a projector, a laptop, one teacher
tablet, 20 student tablets, and one Smart
Bro Pocket Wifi to connect the school to the
internet. The equipment comes loaded with
learning and teaching modules, as well as
relevant applications.

One of the notable features of each of these
carts is the pioneering app Batibot, the first
interactive mobile app for kids in Filipino
that is aligned with the DepEd’s kindergarten
curriculum. The app is based on the popular

children’s educational TV show Batibot, making
it highly engaging for preschool learners and
even their parents who grew up watching the
show.

Designed for kids from Kinder up to Grade 3,
the app aims to help children develop literacy
through learning the alphabet, storytelling,
karaoke, and games. The app also supports
early literacy by nurturing an early love for
literature through a storytelling feature called
Kwentong Batibot (Batibot Stories). As of April
2017, the app has reached 437,101 downloads
from the Google Play Store and the Cosmic
Pinoy App Store.

For all these innovations, Smart’s TechnoCart
program won a Social Contribution Award
at the prestigious World Communication
Awards (WCA) ceremony. So far, TechnoCarts
have been donated to 40 beneficiary schools
with a total of 185 kindergarten teachers
and 9,841 kindergarten students. Schools
may apply directly to Smart to receive the
program package for free, or donors or school
supporters may nominate their beneficiary
school to the program.

Teen from Makati City sought financial contributions
from loved ones and pooled the money to sponsor
a Smart TechnoCart, which she then donated to an
Ormoc school.

ADDRESSING GAPS IN TEACHER
RESOURCES: Gabay Guro and
Infoteach Outreach

PLDT is also implementing various initiatives
through corporate and government
partnerships to boost the ICT capabilites of
more public schools. Using the company’s
extensive digital infrastructure, PLDT has
managed to create programs that enrich
the capacity and skills of faculty members
while integrating ICT tools in their teaching
methods. These programs are Gabay Guro and
Infoteach Outreach.

According to PLDT, many public high schools
and universities, as well as their teaching staff,
still lack the proper 21st century technology to
compete in an advancing economy. As such,
the company established Gabay Guro—the
flagship program of PLDT-SMART Foundation.

Aiming to “change the lives of those who
changed ours,” Gabay Guro has six components
called “pillars of learning.” These are a) Housing
and Educational Facilities; b) Scholarships;
c) Trainings; d) Livelihood Programs; e)
Broadband and Computerization; and f )
Teacher’s Tribute.

According to PLDT-SMART Foundation Chair
Manny Pangilinan, the gratitude we owe
teachers in shaping our minds and lives can
never be repaid. But through Gabay Guro,
their company can at least show their deep
gratitude by funding the postgraduate studies
of teachers and by providing them additional
livelihood support.

Complementing Gabay Guro is their Infoteach
Outreach Program, a partnership between
PLDT, Intel Philippines and UP Open University.
This program opens more opportunities for
public elementary and high school teachers
to hone their skills and acquire greater ICT
knowledge.

Gabay Guro is now working with 47 partner
institutions and has awarded scholarship
grants to 1,123 teachers. The program has also
reached out to over 15,000 teachers through
various seminars and short courses. Infoteach
Outreach, on the other hand, has produced
562 trainers and reached 159 public high
schools in 38 cities and municipalities. Since
2004, it has likewise conducted workshops and
seminars to enhance the computer knowledge
and technical skills of thousands of students
and teachers.

UPDATING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION

Out of 138 countries, the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2016-
2017 ranks the Philippines as 41st on capacity
for innovation, 72nd on the quality of scientific
research, 78th on availability of scientists and
engineers, and 79th on the quality of math and
science education.

Smart SWEEP

70
Colleges

35,000

Many attribute this lackluster performance
to the low budget allocation for scientific
research and development among our schools.
For instance, only 4.8% of all public elementary
schools have their own science laboratory. Of
this already small fraction, 42% is located in the
capital region as compared to 2.3% in conflict-
affected ARMM region.

Businesses are responding to this pressing
challenge by creating CSR and marketing
programs that are able to raise funds for new
equipment and innovative teaching strategies.
Among the most notable and far-reaching
of these initiatives are the Dynamic Learning
Program, which Smart and PLDT-Smart
Foundation are helping implement in more
schools, Smart Wireless Engineering Education
Program (SWEEP), and Aboitiz’s Special Science
Elementary School (SSES) and TechVoc.

DYNAMIC LEARNING AND
WIRELESS EDUCATION
THROUGH PLDT AND SMART

The Dynamic Learning Program promotes
independent learning among students to
improve their academic outcomes. Here,
students focus more on practice and activity-
based learning. The students learn modules
in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics. Developed by Ramon Magsaysay
laureates and Filipino physicists Christopher
Bernido and Ma. Victoria Carpio-Bernido,
this teaching method was first implemented
in the Central Visayan Institute Foundation
(CVIF) in Jagna, Bohol in 2002. Since then, the
teaching strategy has been able to improve
the academic performance of students in more
than a thousand public and private schools
nationwide.

Meanwhile, the Smart Wireless Engineering
Education Program (SWEEP) uses the

company’s existing infrastructure and
technological expertise as leverage to elevate
the teaching of Information Technology
(IT) and Electronics Communications
Engineering (ECE) courses. The program has
now established a network of 42 colleges and
universities that offer ECE and IT degrees, and
it has provided scholarships to 67 students.
Almost 35,000 faculty and students from 70
colleges have been trained on technology,
and 153 wireless prototypes have been
developed by students under this program. In
addition, SWEEP holds an annual innovation
competition called the SWEEP Awards.

According to the company, this yearly
prize “encourages students to scan their
environment, identify pain points, design and
create a working technology-based solution,
and finally test the market for potential profit.
It is an end-to-end exercise that can lead to
commercialization of what starts out as school
projects.”

ABOITIZ FOUNDATION:
Special Science Schools and
Technical Learning

Aboitiz’s SSES and TechVoc schools address the
lack of our school’s STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) facilities and
equipment, our limited number of laboratories
and the lack of qualified science and math
teachers in many regions.

SSES is implemented in partnership with the
DepEd and is aligned with the government’s
thrust for a stronger focus on science-based
skills and platforms among young students.
To date, the program has created 10 SSESs,
trained 23 teachers, constructed or refurbished
39 classrooms, and provided laboratory
rooms, equipment, and ICT-based learning

resources, as well as relevant textbooks and
supplementary materials.

Complementing this drive is Aboitiz’s TechVoc,
which uses vocational-school learning as an
alternative solution to help about 80% of high
school students who don’t have the means to
pursue a full college education.

TechVoc complements the government’s K-12
program by teaching technical skills that lead
to immediate employment. Aboitiz has so far
adopted 35 tech-voc schools, constructed or
refurbished 87 classrooms and laboratories,
and trained 71 teachers under this platform.
On top of these numbers, TechVoc students
are also given reference books, tools, and
equipment, while TechVoc teachers receive
training for NCII certification. The company’s
total investments in both SSES and TechVoc
has reached over P80 million as of 2015.

DEVELOPMENTAL FINANCING
FOR EDUCATION

Financing affordable and inclusive educational
programs is a key strategy of the Development
Bank of the Philippines. In fact, two of the
biggest educational financing programs in
the country today—DBP’s Educational Fund
Program (DEFP) and DEEP (Endowment for
Education Program)—are managed by this
state-owned developmental bank.

As a development financing institution (DFI),
DBP’s efforts are well aligned with the goals of
the UN SDGs.

DEFP extends strategic loans that empower
schools to deliver better quality education
to their constituents. This financing program
supports both public and private learning
institutions at all school levels, especially
those in poor regions and provinces. Qualified
or eligible borrowers under this program

include local government units, educational
institutions that are recognized by the
Commission on Higher Education (CHED)
or TESDA, and training centers accredited
by government regulatory bodies. Aside
from its regular credit line, the program has
a component that also provides loans to
educational institutions that seek to extend
retail on lending services for their students
who need assistance. As of August 2016, the
program’s total loan portfolio has reached
P2.49 billion comprising of 106 projects. The
bank has so far invested P10 billion to keep this
program in motion.

DEEP, meanwhile, is now on its 8th year of
implementation and has disbursed more
than P800 million to support the schooling
of over 3,500 scholars. This CSR initiative
provides scholarships to the brightest
and most promising youth students from
low-income families. Aside from its main
scholarship component, DBP is aiming to
ensure the immediate employment of its
graduates through proper course selection
and by partnering with other institutions and
potential employers. It also operates a pay-it-
forward scheme through the DEEP Scholars
Association (DEEPSA), encouraging graduates
of the program to volunteer, and give support
and resources to upcoming scholars.

DEEP has graduated a total of 2,042 scholars
as of September 2016. Out of this number,
1,625 are now employed and 435 are actively
contributing to the program’s heightened
efforts.

According to DBP Vice President Paul D. Lazaro:

“

Financing is considered as a key element for the success of the new sustainable development goals.
The international conference on financing held last year in Addis Ababa set bold measures to refit
global financial practices to generate sustainable development investments.

For DFIs, this is significant in that it spells out not only their effectivity in achieving productivity
targets on the level of the organization but also their relevance in contributing to their host country’s
economic, social, and environmental objectives which are the pillars of sustainable development.

INCREASED ACCESS TO
AFFORDABLE QUALITY EDUCATION

Two Philippine conglomerates that have
recently entered the educational business are
Ayala Corporation and PHINMA Corporation
(formerly Bacnotan Consolidated Industries,
Inc.) and Ayala Corporation. Both companies
are notable for their recent ventures in
education having established AC Education
and PHINMA Education Holdings, respectively,
with the end of goal of making quality
education inclusive and a lot more affordable
for low-income groups.Ayala started its chain
of affordable private high schools in 2013
with its Affordable Private Education Center
(APEC Schools). At present, AC Education has
approximately 18,000 students in its APEC
Schools (Grades 7-12) and University of Nueva
Caceres (K-12 and higher education) in Naga
City. From 3,300 students and 24 branches
in AY 2015-16, APEC Schools now has 10,500
students as of AY 2016-2017 with 27 branches
in Metro Manila, Rizal, Cavite, and Batangas.

In 2015, income from five PHINMA schools
amounted to P407.2 million

At present, PHINMA Education Holdings runs
six educational institutions of higher learning:
Araullo University, Cagayan de Oro College,
University of Pangasinan, University of Iloilo,
Career Academy Asia, and Southwestern
University.

To

Turning their developmental advocacies in
education from philantrophy into sustainable
business ventures, both Ayala and Phinma
are directly tackling poverty and limited
resources—cited by many as the most
pressing and common reason among students
who drop out and perform poorly—by
offering an affordable education option.

According to AC Education “All-in costs at
APEC Schools are among the most affordable
for private schools in the Greater Manila Area.”
The school charges as low as 22,200 (USD444)
in annual fees including books, placing it
in the lowest quartile among private high
schools in the Philippines in terms of fees.
The schools are also strategically located at
the center of targeted communities to lower
student transport costs. APEC School fees are
almost comparable to government’s per capita
spending for public school education of P
21,184 per year in 2014.

AC Education “is committed to delivering
high quality and affordable education that
significantly enhances the employability
of its graduates. This is our way of helping
address the large gaps in the quality, price,
and accessibility of topnotch education in the
country, through innovative entrepreneurial
and educational approaches.”

PHINMA articulates similar goals. In its
submission to the UNDP-PBE portal, the
company said:

“PHINMA Education Network seeks to
create opportunities for communities in
the Philippines to have accessible, quality
education. We offer not only affordable high-
quality education, but also a brighter future
for globally competitive Filipino professionals
and workers. To fulfill this vision, the PHINMA
Education network aims to create graduates
that are competitive in the global market,
while at the same time, empowering them and
their families to live a life that matters.”

The challenge for both companies now is
how to sustain their entrepreneurial zeal and
commitment, while staying profitably afloat,
especially when the market becomes volatile.

“It took PHINMA 10 years to build up its
education business into one that would generate
respectable profits,” said the company.

“Those who come to us are children of farmers,
tricycle drivers, and manual laborers. They
cannot pay tuition fees upfront. So we developed
our strategies in educating the poor. We allow
them to pay whenever they can, give them some
leeway, and offer scholarships aside from our
already low fees.”

“Even though we’re focused on education for the
poor, we made it clear to ourselves that it is still a
business and it cannot be run as a charity,” said
PHINMA executives. “ That’s the real challenge
for us—providing quality education that is both
accessible to the poor and profitable [for the
company.]”.

Gaps and Opportunities

For more Philippine businesses to help bring
about meaningful change in our educational
system, a new breed of partnerships must
come together to leverage on some of our
private sector’s most powerful assets: its
capacity to innovate, its supply chain, and the
inherent passion of the Filipino people and
workforce to support corporate giving through
education.

Despite the country’s advances in some key
educational fronts, many studies still show
considerable gaps in educational achievement.
For instance, the gap between school
achievements among boys and girls continue
to be wide, with boys at the surprising
disadvantage in almost every single outcome
measure. According to recent studies, boys are
more likely to drop out or attract disciplinary
problems and achieve low marks in the
Philippines.

Schools that still have no access to the
most basic services, such as electricity,
are now overlooked as providing internet
connectivity becomes an even more popular
marketing drive. About 12% or 5,743 public
schools in the country still have no power
connections. In the coming years, many hope
that the government, in partnership with
energy companies or other multinationals
with production plants in remote areas,
may find business solutions for this glaring
developmental gap.

There are also instances where schools are
accredited yet lack the necessary facilities and
equipment to properly fulfill their mandates.
A policy amendment requiring assets for
accreditation can help address this. The private
sector can still contribute by assisting in
acquiring these resources.

The divide between urban and rural corporate
educational spending likewise continues to
widen, with schools in the capital region and
highly urbanized cities receiving most of the
attention of private donors.

Nonetheless, opportunities for classroom-
less school systems can be explored and an
ecosystem of financial services for students’
continued education be drawn up.

AIMING FOR
ECONOMIC
INCLUSION

Beyond their specific targets, the SDGs, as a whole, represent a sea of change
in developmental funding. Moving away from dole-outs and aid as the
primary means to help developing countries, world leaders now agree that
trade and inclusive economic development are the best ways to put more
people into the economic center and ultimately out of poverty.

In this light, the participation of groups that have been excluded for so long in
economic activities is absolutely essential. Considering how millions of people
the world over depend on businesses for their livelihood, the role of the
private sector in ensuring the success of the SDGs becomes even more vital.

In the Philippines, the private sector employs
an estimated 48.5% of our entire labor force.
This clearly indicates that local industries have
the great capacity to impact the lives not only
of millions of employees, but also of millions
more who are part, in varying degrees, of the
supply chains of many businesses.

If the number of such businesses increase over
the next few years alone, we are certain that
the Philippines will quickly advance, alongside
a stronger business environment, in its goal to
establish permanent pathways to progress for
numerous communities still living below the
poverty line.

Based on the submissions that UNDP and PBE
received for the first edition of this report, we
are heartened to see that a good number of
Philippine companies are already doing a great
job in pushing inclusive approaches into their
business strategies and agenda.

In this section, we survey the extent of the
Philippine private sector’s contribution to
inclusive and equitable economic growth. We
also identify gaps and recommend areas that
entrepreneurs may pursue to achieve greater
scale and stronger impact.

SHARED VALUE THROUGH
ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS

Businesses fuel the economy through job
creation, generation of public revenue for
governments, and expanding economic
opportunity along their value chains. Based
on the results of the 2014 Annual Survey of
Philippine Business and Industry (ASPBI), the
total number of establishments with total
employment (TE) of 20 and over in the formal
sector of the economy was recorded at 35,009 in
2014. Total employment grew by 3.8 percent to
4,127,623 from 3,978,185 workers in 2013. Total
compensation paid to employees comprising

of payment for gross salaries and wages of
employees and other benefits paid by the
establishment amounted to P 1.2 trillion, up by
5.5 percent from P1.1 trillion recorded in 2013.

Based on the 2015 Sustainability Reports of
16 companies, the total revenues generated
amounted to P 2 trillion, with 49 percent or
P 972 billion of revenues distributed to key
stakeholders—25 percent paid to suppliers, 20
percent to government, shareholders, and capital
providers, three percent to employees, and 0.08
percent donations to communities and charities.
Fifty-one percent of the revenues generated
amounting to P 1 trillion were retained and

INCLUSIVE
EMPLOYMENT MODELS

More Filipino companies are now recognizing
the huge potential in pursuing inclusive hiring
programs while partnering with a broader
base of sectors. Unilab Foundation’s Project
Inclusion, which uncovers a host of business
benefits from hiring Persons with Disability
(PWDs), is a good example of such program.

Project Inclusion believes that given the
right opportunity and proper support,
PWDs can make their unique contributions
in the workplace. By carefully matching the
exceptional abilities of the PWDs, with gainful
job opportunities, the program has managed
to create an inspiring way to contribute to
the bottom line while challenging outdated
assumptions in hiring.

Unilab’s Project Inclusion
enables gainful employment for PWDs,
leading to meaningful contributions

sectors who believe in workplace inclusion,
the program has so far given 121 PWDs access
to meaningful work, with 16 companies
now actively hiring PWDs. The program has
also attracted 30 volunteer job coaches and
50 corporate and government partners. It
has produced one job matching website, a
source book documenting successful cases
of workplace inclusion, and a hiring manual
focused on Persons with Neurodevelopmental
Disability.

Three other business models that actively
seek out disadvantaged groups in their hiring
strategies are Messy Bessy, Human Nature,
and Rags2Riches. All three companies cater to
a socially responsive lifestyle market, and all
produce personal or home products that are
quickly finding their niche in the local fashion,
beauty, and home-care industries.

Rags2Riches, for instance, is out to prove that
fashion and sustainability are complementary
concepts. The company partners with
community artisans around the country
to create “eco-ethical” fashion and home
accessories using upcycled materials, overstock
textiles, and indigenous fabrics.

The program has proven, by way of solid
research and practice, that the hiring of PWDs
mutually benefits the company, the team, and
the person.

government, academe, socio civic and private

Today, more than 60% of Messy Bessy’s
workforce are at-risk young adults. To further
its mission of helping more disadvantaged
young adults, Messy Bessy put up a non-
profit called Helping Ourselves Through
Sustainable Enterprises (HOUSE) Foundation
in 2015. HOUSE Foundation aims to replicate
the same programs that Messy Bessy
provides to its beneficiaries to other social
enterprises, businesses or organizations.
This allows the business to market itself as a
highly responsible brand and a leading social
enterprise in this front.

natural and locally made. Branding their
initiative as “pro-Philippines, pro-poor, and
pro-environment,” a group of Gawad Kalinga
volunteers established Human Nature to
develop safe and sustainable products using
ingredients from local plants and produce.

According to its founders, Human Nature
commits to providing job security and
dignified wages to improve the quality of life
of their workers. Working with 30 community
farms, the company provides full benefits,
regular employment, and a salary rate that is
70% more than the minimum wage in Metro
Manila. They also invest in skills training,
sustainable technology, infrastructure, and
values formation, and are willing to finance
some ventures of their suppliers to help their
partners expand. All these have enabled
Human Nature to reach over 30 branches
nationwide.

Messy Bessy is another producer of home and
personal care products with a timely business
goal. Since it was established in 2007, this
business has sought to provide education,
employment, and rehabilitation for young

One pioneering company that has managed
to create a business model providing inclusive
employment is BagoSphere.

BagoSphere recruits disconnected youth and
gives them the skills they need to achieve
lifelong personal and professional success and
fundamentally change their life trajectories.
Their curriculum follows a combination of
TESDA NCII Certified Program, and a task-based
approach to teach skills for in-demand entry
level jobs. One of BagoSphere’s programs,

the ASCEND Job Preparation Program has
trained over 900 graduates since 2013, placing
85% of them in partner companies within
two months of graduation. They are also the
top recruitment provider for the largest BPO
company in Negros Occidental. BagoSphere
has also made it very simple for low income
students to find a study now pay later loan, by
partnering with one of the leading MFI NGOs
in the Philippines and designing an innovative
risk-sharing model.

The program is a good example of how to
resolve the mismatch between the technical
and practical skills of our labor force and the
human capital needs of our industries.

INCLUDING PARTNER COMMUNITIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Without losing track of their profit motive,
some of the country’s biggest brands, as
well as a new breed of social enterprises, are
actively integrating formerly marginalized
groups into their respective value chains.

As proven by the success of these companies,
it is increasingly becoming profitable for a host
of business concepts to partner with micro-

entrepreneurs, farmers, and even remote rural
communities as a way to advance corporate
goals.

Today, these inspiring partnerships are
transforming underserved communities into
dynamic new markets and new stable sources
of supply.

STRENGTHENING THE SUPPLY
CHAIN BY DIRECTLY
ENGAGING FARMERS

Mindanao-based Bali Oil Palm Produce Corp.
is banking on its vital partnership with poor
farming communities, such as the Kalilangan
Oil Palm Growers Association, to expand its
palm oil production venture.

The goals of this multibillion venture are
aligned with the Inclusive Business in
Mindanao initiative, a partnership between
the Philippine Business for Social Progress
(PBSP) and the Mindanao Development
Authority (MinDA) to accelerate private sector
investments in Mindanao.

In partnership with the KOPGA, Bali Oil
is developing 3,000 hectares in 2017 and
eventually to about 60,000 hectares of
plantation in Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon in
the next next years. The company worked with
the DBP to grant KOPGA over P300 million in
collateral-free loans, over a 10-year period, and
at 8% annual interest. This will be in the form
of best in class agricultural inputs provide by
Bali Oil, while KOPGA will provide the labor as
equity. In addition, Bali Oil will transfer the oil
palm technology through technical training
and services, all of which will lead to increasing
the growers income from the present P 6,000
per month to P 15,000 to P 30,000 per month
within ten years.

Restaurant giant Jollibee Foods Corporation
(JFC), which is composed of Jollibee,
Greenwich, Chowking, Red Ribbon, Mang
Inasal and Burger King in the Philippines has
adopted inclusive business in its practices.
Under the company’s Farmer Entrepreneurship
Program, implemented by Jollibee Group
Foundation smallholder farmers are trained
to become agroentrepreneurs, gain skills in
strengthening their farmer groups, get better
access to credit, and linked to the supply chain
of JFC.

Since the launch of FEP in 2008, JFC has
worked with various partners to train more
than 1, 800 farmers on agroentrepreneurship.
Among them, eleven farmer groups from six
provinces in Luzon and Visayas have been
regularly supplying JFC. Over the years, these
groups have delivered over 3,000 metric tons
of various vegetables to JFC including white
onions, salad tomatoes, hot peppers, green
bell peppers and Philippine lemon. From 2014
to 2016, sales from the total deliveries of FEP
farmers amounted to more than P115 million.

Two other inclusive businesses that actively
partner with farmers is Kape’t Buhay (Cofffee
and Life) by Bote Central Inc. and Nestlé’s
Nescafé brand.

Kape’t Buhay has invested P10 million in
various forms of capital to help establish at
least 26 community-based enterprises—all
of them owned and managed by organized
clusters of coffee farmers. Inspiring farmers
with its “soil-to-cup” business model, this
program has been able to transform coffee
growers into viable and even successful
entrepreneurs.

Through a patented coffee roasting machine,
developed by Bote Central’s owner, specifically
designed for this venture, Kape’t Buhay has
empowered farmers to break down economic
barriers and become their own roasters,
distributors, retailers, and even baristas. As the
income from coffee beans increases by 100%
when it become roasted coffee—and even up
to 1,000% when it gets sold in retail per cup—
the most enterprising of Kape’t Buhay’s farming
partners stand to earn from P300 to P6,000 per
kilo of coffee beans that they produce.

Working along parallel lines, Nestlé Philippines’
NESCAFÉ Plan, also shares best practices and
sustainability standards to help local coffee
farmers achieve steady and reliable supplies,
gain quick access to buying stations, and
ultimately get paid at world-market rates
within eight banking hours.

KAPE’T BUHAY:
FROM SOIL TO CUP

Fernando Cantos, a member of the
Pinagdanlayan Farmers Association Inc. (PFAI)
in Dolores, Quezon, earns merely 10 – 12 pesos
(P) a kilo from the coffee beans he harvested.
His income is exceedingly low and is not
sufficient for his family’s daily needs. Even if he
wanted to increase his crop’s buying price, he
could not. He lacks the capital to have the raw
coffee beans become processed coffee beans.
However, when PFAI becomes one of the
twenty-six partner beneficiaries of the Kape’t
Buhay program, Fernando Cantos becomes “a
farmer entrepreneur” [i] .

Kape’t Buhay, one of Bote Central’s initiatives, is
a social enterprise “focused on using fair trade
practices in the production of local coffee” [ii]
It aims to empower average coffee farmers,
women, and youth to become entrepreneurs in
their own rights by providing an enterprise of
their own. The model is based on the “from soil

to cup” [iii] concept which aims to empower
the coffee farmers to become active players in
the local coffee industry.

The program provides training and technology
to coffee farmers. Farmers are educated,
trained, and mentored to become farmer
entrepreneurs in the agribusiness of coffee.
Furthermore, farmers receive coffee roasting
machines which allow them to roast these
beans right in their own homes. With the
machines, they are also able to brew the
beans, and sell the cups of coffee to their
local communities. From solely being coffee
farmers, they can be participants in the whole
value chain of coffee production such as
distribution, retailing and even becoming
baristas. Kape’t Buhay has given them a new
means of livelihood and has provided them
the opportunity to become more empowered
in managing poverty (SDG 1). With this new
business model, Fernando Cantos can expect
to earn an income of 230 pesos (P) per kilo for
a pack of roasted coffee and 700 pesos (P) if he
brews his own coffee.

CREATING ECONOMIC CENTERS
IN REMOTE COMMUNITIES

The ability of inclusive businesses to inspire
economic growth in even the most remote
communities is evident in the work of
companies as varied as El Nido Resorts and
Coffee for Peace.

El Nido Resorts, a cluster of upscale, exclusive
resorts in Northern Palawan, has partnered
with the low-income small-island communities
in the vicinity of its resorts. Coffee for Peace,
on the other hand, is a social enterprise using
a unique coffee business approach to resolve
conflicts and create livelihood streams for a
mountain tribe in Mindanao.

El Nido Resorts, operating under the official
corporate name Ten Knots Development
Corporation, is an eco-tourism company that
operates high-end resorts in El Nido and
Taytay—two pristine but remote countryside
locations that is also home to small low-
income communities.

Alongside the company’s biodiversity
protection drives, Ten Knots runs a
complementary local sourcing program
to build the entrepreneurial capacities of
its immediate community. The company’s
ultimate aim is to achieve maximum profits
by placing the highest values on its natural

wealth and host communities. The company
has a director of sustainability, a key
management position, to oversee and manage
this approach.

Organic produce grown by its neighbor
communities now comprise 60% of the resorts’
total kitchen purchases, with organic-fed
pigs making up to 90% of its total supply of
pork. The company also provides training
for aspiring women entrepreneurs so they
can produce some of the accessories and
complimentary accessories needed by the
resort.

Coffee for Peace is also using entrepreneurship
as leverage to improve the economic
conditions of Visayan migrants, such as the
Bagobo-Tagabawa. This tribe has traditionally
lived in upland communities in Mt. Apo, until
logging operations in the 1960s forced them
to live in conflict with the lowland logging
settlements. Both the tribe and the lowland
community have suffered from poor economic
prospects and a prolonged period of dispute
resulting in instances of violence.

By establishing a coffee mill and paving the
way for both communities to pursue their
own coffee business as one cooperative,
the company has managed to create job
opportunities while simultaneously solving
long-running conflicts.

CONNECTING
MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS
TO WIDER MARKETS

Integrating even the smallest businesses and home-based enterprises into the supply chain
of large companies can achieve two sustainability business targets. One is to cut down on
distributorship costs and increase profits, and the second is to create gainful livelihood for
individuals and groups who have limited employment prospects.

Smart’s Ka-Partner retailer program, a loyalty and incentive program for Smart cellphone load
retailers, is simultaneously achieving both targets in one program. Package costs enable retailers to
earn about 4.5% of the cost for prepaid loading services (e.g. for a P100 load, retailers will earn P4.5).
Aside from the profits earned by each retailer, the program enables them to upgrade their small
business ventures and even gives them chances to win cash prizes.

EXTENDING THE BENEFICIAL
IMPACTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE
AND TECHNOLOGY FOR
MORE PEOPLE

In terms of global performance and ranking of
overall infrastructure quality, the Philippines
still lags behind the five pioneer members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN). This has prodded the government
to significantly improve the country’s
infrastructure. However, actual infrastructure
spending, particularly between 2012 and 2014,
fell short of the government’s targets.

In support of the government’s thrust to
spread economic activity and opportunities
to the rest of the country, companies like
Cebu Holdings Inc. are driving in shareholder
gains through large-scale infrastructure

developments in provincial capitals and hubs.
With the support of the Cebu government,
CHI has poured in over P55 billion in land and
infrastructure investments to continue to grow
and expand Cebu Business Park and Cebu
I.T. Park—now two of the leading economic
hubs in the south operating under a special
economic zone status.

Aside from creating the space for commercial
growth, CHI constantly looks for ways to
create markets that can further ignite the
entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses.
For instance, Cebu I.T. Park has opted to
use a strategically located vacant lot into
an incubation space for micro and small
enterprises while the property is still being
primed for permanent use. Now called Garden
Bloc, CHI attracts the best small business
concepts in the province by offering the use of
topnotch commercial spaces at much lower rates.

ICT SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES

Using existing ICT infrastructure, businesses
can also support economic growth by
harnessing the power of digital technology to
reach previously unconnected communities.
This is the core business strategy of ventures
such as GCash, Globe MyBusiness, Globe
Business, and Freenet.

Globe myBusiness maximizes the potential
of micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs) so they can take their passion for
business onwards and upwards to achieve
success. Offering customizable business
solutions designed to fit their needs, Globe
myBusiness empowers Filipino MSMEs to
embrace the digital shift, giving them the
competitive advantage to improve efficiency
and productivity, reduce cost, and further grow
their business, allowing them to create their
own stories of success.

Unbanked and underserved sectors in the
Philippines can now partake of economic
growth without going through formal banking
channels through Mynt, a wholly-owned
financial services company of Globe. Mynt has
so far over three million customers doing P4
billion transaction value per month serviced
through a network of more than 12,000
partner outlets. Its subsidiary G-Xchange
operates GCash, a mobile money service that
taps into the wide customer base of Globe.
Moreover, Mynt has recently started its own
lending company under the name Fuse, and
has disbursed approximately 4,000 loans to
3,000 borrowers in the last quarter of 2016.

Globe Business, the enterprise information
and communications technology (ICT) arm of
Globe, is leading the way in encouraging local
government units like Makati City to adopt the
integration of ICT in governance as a means
of improving the delivery of government
services and exchange of information. In May
2017, Globe and the City of Makati launched
the Makatizen Card which will enable the city’s
500,000 residents to transact with and avail the
services of the city government. They can also
use their cards to pay fees and taxes, as well as
for personal remittances and other financial
transactions. City government employees,
on the other hand, can use their Makatizen
Card to receive salaries and allowances.
The Makatizen Card also functions as an
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Card and is
a valid government ID. This initiative supports
Globe’s drive to transform the Philippines into
a digital nation by instilling the importance
of eGovernance to offices ranging from the
local government units up to the national
government.

Working along parallel lines is Voyager
Innovations’ Freenet, which connects small
enterprises to application developers who can
create digital tools and other technological
solutions to help small businesses flourish.
Freenet also allows small businesses to
make their websites and mobile applications
accessible to data users for free, thereby
enlarging the reach and market of their
products and services. Today, there are already
70 brands using the Freenet platform. This
number is expected to continue growing in
the next years as more small businesses realize
the need to modernize their marketing and
communication channels.

Gaps and Opportunities

While efforts have been made to include the base of the pyramid (BOP) segment of
the population, economic value generated still has not significantly benefited the BOP.
Economic activities at the base of the pyramid must be activated through innovative private
sector models, such as increasing manufacturing industry, providing access to financial
services, creating an ecosystem of comprehensive solution that will boost the capability of
productivity of small-holder farmers.

In spite of the continued growth of markets
and economies, marked disparities in income
continue to exist with the richest 10 % earning
up to 40 % of the world’s total income.

Considering the fast growth of populations
in developing countries, this discrepancy can
go up by another 11 %, further compounding
the situation of people who already make do
with low salaries for the same jobs others do at
higher rates.

Inequities in income is anathema to economic
growth and perpetuates not only poverty but

also conflict and unrest. It is therefore in the
best interest of business to propose solutions
that usher in equitable wealth distribution and
greater financial inclusivity for communities
living in the base of the pyramid.

Such solutions may include improving the
regulation and monitoring of financial markets
and institutions, and creating new business
models that focus on inclusion, learning,
and better access to credit as a core strategy.
Facilitating the safe migration and mobility
of people is also key to bridging the income
divide.4

however, consistently complied with the 8%
requirement. Compliance for universal and
commercial banks was below the required rate
and declined over a stipulated period. Thrift
banks were likewise unable to sustain their
ability to meet these targets.

Directly addressing this roadblock in private
financing are some of the country’s leading
banks, who are finding alternative ways not
only to provide access to loans but also to
strengthen the abilities of small enterprises to
compete in today’s highly technological field.

BPI Foundation’s BPI Sinag is a platform that
promotes and advances social enterprises
through coaching, mentoring, and providing
access to finance.

This annual search for the best social
enterprise business models recognizes social
enterprises as catalysts for societal innovation
and inclusive growth. BPI Sinag targets to
capacitate and scale-up enterprises that
create solutions to a variety of social problems
through new ideas and seek meaningful
impact for their partner communities.

For its part, UnionBank of the Philippines
(UnionBank) came up with an innovative
solution that helps women or “nanays” who
run “sari-sari” or small home-based stores in
far-flung areas that have little or no access
to banks. Through the help of microfinance
institutions such as Tulay sa Pag-Unlad, Inc.
(TSPI)—these “nanays” are given access to

TRANSFORMATIONAL BUSINESS
63

loans to help their businesses. However,
they still need to travel far to pay their
amortizations which exposes them to certain
pain points such as the cost of traveling, risk of
holding cash, and the need to close shop for
a day.

UnionBank, in partnership with Globe’s GCash
mobile money platform, developed the
Mobile Money Cash Management (MMCM)
which enabled TSPI with a collection and
disbursement service for the 300,000 “nanays”
all over the country. This digital platform has
now successfully processed over 9 million real-
time transactions worth P19 billion.

Through MMCM, TSPI reduced its
reconciliation turnaround time from fourteen
days to one day. And for the “nanays”, they
now have a more convenient channel for
receiving and repaying their loans; leading to
the improvement of their living standards.

Among foreign banks, Citi as the largest in
the Philippines, has extended strong and
consistent support for financial inclusion. Since

2002, the Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards
(CMA) sweep the country for outstanding
micro business owners that escaped poverty
and brought prosperity to their communities.
The winners are showcased in national
events and community town halls to inspire
more to become micro economic heroes.
Seeking to address knowledge and skills
gaps among micro business owners, even
with winners of CMA, the Citi Microenterprise
Development Center was established to offer
short management courses, skills training,
networking opportunities, and various
incentives to inspire the growth of more
microenterprises.

Working with various non-profit partners,
Citi also invested in designing a One-Stop
System for Growing Microentrepreneurs,
which served as blueprint for today’s Negosyo
Centers, and research studies including the
Sustainable Growth for Marginal and Small
Farmers Program, to identify high-potential
value chains and new business models that
subsistence farmers can pursue to succeed in
the agricultural industry.

LENDING BY NON-BANKING
INSTITUTIONS

Technological innovations and creative
business approaches have also made it
possible for a new breed of companies to
participate in financial inclusion for MSMEs.
PaidUp and Cebuana Lhuiller, two non-banking
companies, are proving that empowering
marginalized groups through strategic
loan and crowdfunding services can be a
lucrative venture. They also show the ability
of technology to overcome developmental
obstacles.

Paidup has processed over
P1.5 million worth of transactions

Cebuana Lhuillier, for instance, has been able
to parlay the success of its pawnshop business
into more sustainable credit services. Cebuana
Lhuillier, through its financing company
arm, Cebuana Lhuillier Financing Corp.,
now extends small loans to individuals and
groups with limited to zero access to formal
credit through its Lucky Loans (for MSMEs)
and Happy Loans (for individuals). These are
able to create value for poor communities by
offering a simplified application process, easy

terms, and fewer requirements. The company’s
huge network of 2,000 pawnshop outlets
complemented by an online application
scheme, act as financing agents, to make these
programs easier to access and more appealing
to its target market.

PaidUp is another non-banking venture that
offers innovative financial and marketing
services to small enterprises. This mobile
phone app allows its partner stores to
crowdfund or solicit investments directly from
their “top fans” or loyal customers. In return,
they enjoy special discounts and offers from
their favorite stores. This innovative marketing
and investment platform enables small stores
to bypass banks while creating ways for
entrepreneurs to touch base directly with their
clients in new inventive ways.

According to the online publication
Fintechnews Singapore, Paidup is a “Filipino
startup [that] seeks to reinvent how we order
and pay for food and beverages.”5 It is the first
pre-pay mobile wallet app in the Philippines
with over a hundred merchant partners and
thousands of users. It has processed over P1.5
million (USD30,000) worth of transactions
so far by allowing customers to order food,
drinks, and other services on-the-go, and
without having to wait in lines or settle bills at
checkout.

REMITTANCE CENTERS

The Philippines is one of the top recipient
countries for overseas remittances, next only
to India and China. Yearly, more than 10 million
Filipinos overseas send around USD 26 billion
to their families in the Philippines, accounting
for around 10% of our country’s Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). 6

Remittances are thus a vital source of income
for many Filipinos, some of whom depend
solely on this income stream for their daily
sustenance. In times of calamities and
emergencies, remittances also often serve
as the only recourse and lifeline for some
households.

As a testament to the power of
entrepreneurship to create developmental
solutions, more Filipino brands are now
directly addressing the high rates levied by
banks for remitting money. By creating new
business models that drastically reduce money
transfer costs, a large number of Filipino
families are now able to stretch the value of
remittances they receive from their relatives.

Palawan Pawnshop Services runs a remittance
service called Pera Padala (literally “send
money”), with no required minimum
remittance amount, a simplified sending
process, and a minimum service charge of only
P2.00 (USD0.04). The company now covers

neighboring countries in Southeast Asia,
including Australia, the UK and Canada.
Cebuana Lhuillier provides another avenue for
remitting money to and within the Philippines.
With more than 2,000 branches nationwide
and many accredited international partners,
this money transfer service offers real-time
transactions and an appointment-system
innovation, which enables clients to set an
appointment before visiting a branch. These
features considerably cut down the time
customers previously spent waiting in line and
filling in forms.

Another company and a new player in this
growing space is Ayannah, the group behind
Sendah Direct and Sendah Remit. Sendah
allows the inter-operability of remittance
centers and other related smaller entities using
the company’s money-transfer software and
web-based platform. With this innovation,
recipients are now free to collect cash
remittances from the nearest possible entity
that has available cash, so long as they are
part of the Sendah network. This enables
smaller or upcoming businesses to cash in on
the lucrative remittance business. According
to the company, Sendah aims to further
bring down remittance transaction rates by
increasing the number of players in this field
and the overall liquidity available within its
network. Ultimately, the goal of the company
is to become the biggest inter-operable
agent-based digital transaction network in the
Philippines.

FINANCIAL LITERACY

According to a Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services survey, the Philippines is one of the
30 least financially literate out of 143 countries.
This translates to only 25% of Filipino adults
who understand the basics of managing
money.

According to a Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Service survey, the Philippines
is one of the 30 least financially literate
out of 143 countries

Improving the ability of more Filipinos to
gain a better understanding on investments,
spending, and money management can
significantly improve local economies. It can
lift entire communities out of poverty and can
result into happier and healthier families in the
long term.

Financial literacy enables stakeholders to make
rational decisions and manage funds.
Using the 50.8% gross savings-GDP average
of the Philippines from 2005 to 2015 as a
benchmark, a 10% improvement in the
efficiency of financial management alone
could boost the country’s GDP growth by 5
percentage points.7

FINANCE EDUCATION

With an aim to produce topnotch financial professionals while centralizing support for finance
education in the Philippines, the founders of the Financial Education Center or FEdCenter has
invested an estimated P5 million annually over the past few years. The FEdCenter is a network
of 136 schools (as of 2016) covering around 20,000 to 30,000 students and educators. It also
advances financial literacy and learning through programs such as the National Finance Summit,
National Finance Competition, National Finance Education Week, and the Financial Literacy
Caravan, which travel to various universities across the country. Aside from these programs, the
Center highlights financial sustainability as a cornerstone of finance education.

Outside formal schooling initiatives, other companies such as Philam Life and General Insurance
are stepping up efforts to improve the financial literacy numbers in the country. The company is
doing so by inculcating the value of financial literacy among children while they are still in their
formative years. This program, called Philam SAVES or Savings Awareness and Values Education
Sessions, equips school children with the right skills and information to see them through better
financial decisions as they grow up.

Since 2006, the finance academe network
expanded to 136 schools

In 2015, Philam SAVES held 20 sessions,
teaching more than 1,000 school children

Gaps and Opportunities

As in most areas of entrepreneurship,
partnerships and collaboration are essential
to advance financial inclusion models. With
the unprecedented growth in the use of
technology among lower-income markets,
more companies can establish synergies and
pursue new schemes to break barriers to
learning as well as access to credit and other
funding streams.

Both commercial and rural banks, for instance,
can work with telecommunication providers
to roll out digital banking mechanisms for the
unbanked in the countryside. New loan and
credit providers can also enlist the support of
retailers with numerous branches to further
facilitate ease of payment for those living in
distant municipalities.

The role of the government in this area is also
vital. For instance, the government has the
power to regulate financial institutions to
protect consumers from scams and schemes
that capitalize on low levels of financial
literacy. The government can compile relevant

data of micro-credit providers to both protect
and enhance this crucial lending space in the
future. It can also integrate financial literacy in
our basic education curriculum starting at the
elementary level.

In addition, private enterprises can explore
new business concepts that can generate
profit by providing other forms of financial
services in rural markets. Companies, for
instance, can work on addressing distrust some
rural communities have on credit and digital
platforms. This will lay down the foundation for
these communities to transition from relying
solely on cash into a more expandable online
mode of finance.

These initiatives can furthaer support the
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion which
envisions a wide range of financial products
and services that serve a range of market
segments, effective interface of bank and non-
bank products, and use of technology to reach
the financially excluded, among others.8

Innovative Solutions for a Better Environment

The quality of human life is inextricably linked to the quality of its natural
environment. Where rivers exist, communities and industries are born.
Where forests flourish, food, and medicine abound. Any grave threat to the
environment should therefore be seen as a threat to our very survival.

According to UNDP, more than 40% of people around the world are now
affected by water scarcity. This is projected to increase with the rise of global
temperatures as a result of climate change. Further, greenhouse gas emissions
continue to rise, and are now more than 50 percent higher than their 1990 level.

Businesses and the fast pace of commercial progress are often blamed for
many of these environmental challenges. But just as our industries may
negatively impact the planet, it is also the same industry that can provide the
best and most innovative solutions to these problems.

The restoration of water ecosystems, for instance, including the efficient
management of resources, and the reduction of waste and pollutants—all
these challenges are now being addressed by the private sector and have even
become integral business targets for some companies.

As evident in the business case studies and stories in the section—achieving
some SDGs on the environment has become part and parcel of the cost and
profit strategies of many Philippine businesses today.

While economic growth is key to the
development of society, it also brings with it
immense pressure on natural resources and
ecosystems.

With their access to substantial resources
for investments and operations, business
leaders now have a cost imperative and
a moral obligation to use their financial
resources even more wisely to improve the
physical environment where their businesses
operate. More importantly the private sector
is beginning to recognize and internalize
the value of natural capital and the risks and
opportunities associated with it.

Manila Declaration 2015 was signed by 60 key
players in the private sector to take measures
in carbon emissions reduction

One heartening development in the
Philippine business sector’s efforts to make
substantial contributions to environmental
goals is the Philippine business’ response to
climate change in a document submitted to
the Climate Change Commission Philippines
in support of the Paris Agreement.

Dubbed the Manila Declaration 2015, the
document was signed by 60 key players in
the private sector and embodies their call for
every country to take measures in reducing
carbon emission, ensuring that global
cumulative emissions do not exceed one
trillion tonnes, and keeping the global average
temperature increase below 2°C.

This is one concrete example of how business
can contribute significantly to the achievement
of the SDGs. By breaking the business as usual
mindset and pioneering bolder and brighter
solutions, the private sector demonstrates how
they value natural capital.

Private Sector Solutions for a
BETTER ENVIRONMENT

BETTER WAYS FOR WASTE AND WATER

More and more, businesses are realizing there are better ways to manage and maximize financial
and environmental resources. Today, some of our brightest enterprises are using their business
expertise and insight not only to benefit their shareholders but also to improve the physical
surroundings that allow them to achieve more.

FROM TRASH TO TREASURE

Having undergone major expansion within
the last 10 years, Cebu Holdings, Inc. (CHI)
recognizes the need to address the increasing
solid waste of Ayala Center Cebu. For this,
CHI tapped a local and low-income partner,
Barangay Luz, to provide waste collection
services instead of engaging a professional
hauling company.

Through its Agbayay Para sa Kalikupan
(Partnership for the Environment), CHI invested
in a garbage truck and provided a monthly
fuel subsidy and protective equipment for the
health and safety of its community partners
living beside CHI’s flagship estates.

Other than direct income from the waste
management activities, the program also
provides additional livelihood through
upcycling. Recyclable materials from the

waste disposed by Ayala Center Cebu become
raw material for products developed and sold
by women in the barangay.
These have provided solid earnings for
Barangay Luz of about P13.6 million since
2008, while providing Ayala Center Cebu a
sustainable solid waste management program
model that bridges solid waste management
with entrepreneurship, and CSR with inclusive
development.

Another program that gives financial value to
trash is Starbucks’ “Grounds for your Garden.”
Introduced in 1995, this composting project
provides customers the opportunity to fertilize
their gardens with complimentary bags of
coffee grounds. This means less money spent
for disposal by the company, as well as savings
for clients who previously had to pay for soil
bags for their gardening needs. And where
commercial composting is available, many
Starbucks stores are now also able to divert
their remaining coffee grounds and food waste
away from landfills.

PROJECT SWEEP
AND WASTE TO WORTH

The majority of the most commonly found
pieces of garbage in the country today are
plastic items. This fact is not lost on Unilever,
which sells products contained in around six
billion sachets per year, or around 6,000 tonnes
of plastic. To prevent these from ending up
in landfills or clogging waterways, Unilever
Philippines developed a sustainable and
replicable model for plastic collection and
upcycling. This is Project Sweep.

The first W2W facility in the Philippines will
be established in Angeles City, Pampanga.

The city government expects to mitigate at
least 230 tons of municipal solid waste per
day and to generate 10 megawatts of power.

The project employs barangay street sweepers,
who in their spare time, would go around
neighborhoods to collect flexible plastic from
homes. This reduces the amount of plastic
that ends up in landfills, and also provides
extra livelihood for the sweepers who receive
Unilever products in exchange for their efforts.
The Philippine Business for Social Progress
(PBSP) manages the project on the ground
while Earth Management and Recycling
Technologies, Inc. (EMRTI) is responsible for
hauling waste and converting them to pavers.

The formula is simple, but already, it has
recovered about 80,000 kg of plastic. Moreover,

a waste analysis study done in Baseco (an
informal settlement in Manila) revealed that
20% of the residual waste has been reduced
because of Project Sweep. Unilever aims to
scale up in 2017 with a tweaked model that
will incorporate learning from the project.

Tapping the same partners, Unilever
also collects its sachets by integrating
sachet collection into product sales using
“Superstores” as collection and redemption
points wherein each sachet collected. Dubbed
Zero Waste to Nature, Unilever has collected
about 100 million sachets from 2013 to 2016.
Unilever is looking at implementing the
program fully in communities near the Pasig
River by 2020; in the entire Metro Manila by
2025; and nationwide by 2050.

Another multinational giant, Proctor & Gamble,
in partnership with the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), sought to achieve its Long
Term Sustainability Vision and 2020 Goals
of having zero consumer or manufacturing
waste go to landfills. P&G’s Waste to Worth
(W2W) project conducted pilot studies on the
feasibility of building an integrated solid waste
management facility for developing countries
like the Philippines. The feasibility studies
then formed the basis for two proposed pilot
projects to convert solid waste to energy.

To date, the first W2W facility in the Philippines
will be established in Angeles City, Pampanga
with the formal signing of a joint venture
agreement (JVA) between Angeles City and
Sure Global Waste to Worth Innovations. The
city government expects to mitigate at least
230 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day
and to generate 10 megawatts of power.

transports them to their accredited partner
Total Environment Solutions Asset Material
Management (TES-AMM) in the Philippines. The
waste is then shipped to TESAMM Singapore for
recycling and continued processing.

4,000 tonnes of ULABs collected and raised
P99.8 million worth of proceeds over 10 years

With corporate partners Huawei, Aboitiz,
Coca-Cola, US Embassy, Unionbank, and Nestlé
Philippines among others, Globe has managed
to collect e-waste in 2015 amounting to
124,572.19 kg—up by 56% compared to 2014’s
79,968.20 kg. The 2015 proceeds from Project
1 Phone were used to build 46 classrooms
in various public schools across the country
while the 2016 proceeds coming from the total
141,833.69 kg of e-waste collected helped build

ICT classrooms and bring 21st-century learning
to 142 schools, 6,300 teachers students, and
162,646 teachers students nationwide.
Similarly, PLDT Inc., has adopted proper waste
segregation practices across its business units
through its Balik-Baterya (Battery Return)
Program. PLDT partnered with government
agencies Environment Management Bureau
(EMB) and the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (DENR) in developing staging
hubs. With such procedures in place, PLDT has
reduced its impact on the environment and
provided a clean and safe workplace for its
employees. PLDT has 10 designated waste-
staging facilities from where the accredited
transporters will pick up the hazardous waste.
PLDT also partnered with PBSP and Motolite on
the program.

Since 2007, PLDT has collected 2,980 tonnes
of used lead-acid batteries (ULABs) amounting
to P70 million, which support various CSR
programs that, in turn, also produced its own
earnings of P7.81 million.

Over the last 10 years (from 2007-2016), some
P99.8 million worth of proceeds have been
raised from 4,000 tons of ULABs that were
collected from 180 donor companies. These
results also facilitated social impact in terms of
support to health programs and public schools,
as well as the creation of learning centers.

WISER ABOUT WATER

Some Philippine companies are now paving
the way toward efficient water use through
better technologies and improved processes.

P339,300 savings on SFC’s water
consumption for 2010

For instance, Sunlight Foods Corp. (SFC)
implemented several innovative water
conservation initiatives that resulted in the
drastic reduction of water consumption
from 18 liters per kilogram output (L/kg)
to 3 L/kg. This includes installation of a
condensate recovery system, water recycling,
use of auto-faucets for hand-washing, and
innovative procedures for cleaning their
raw materials, processing equipment and
facilities that effectively separate solid waste
from waste water thus reducing the waste
water generation to barest minimum of 0.6 to
0.8 cubic meter/day. SFC also designed and
installed its own wastewater treatment facility,
a small foot print WWT tailor-fit to its waste
water generated and utilizes the Biological
Augmentation technology the treated waste
water was recycled for use in the company
processing facility’s toilets.

These and other improvements in water
metrics have resulted in savings of P339,300 in
2010 for 580,000 kg of product produced and
was sustained up to present.

The cumulative effect on SFC is that its
sustainable operations contributed to its
profitability and also provided a source of
funding for its CSR programs. These initiatives
were also shared with other business
entrepreneurs, national and local government
agencies, and the academe for replication
and greater impact. SFC partnered with the
Department of Science and Technology on
Cleaner Production Techniques trainings the
Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines on
Big Enterprise – Small Enterprise Productivity
Improvement Program, the Department
of Trade and Industry-Center for Industrial
Competitiveness for productivity improvement
trainings-program and the Unilever Selecta
Ice Cream for Unilever Sustainable Agriculture
practices in farming its raw materials the
sustainable way.

For its part, Mondelez Philippines installed in
2012 a unique reverse osmosis and ultraviolet
light water treatment facility, which led to
the heightened use of recycled water and
reduced use of fresh water in its systems. In
the following year, the company installed
a biomass boiler, allowing renewable and
biodegradable sources of energy like rice and
coconut husks to power the company’s plants.

Mondelez saved enough water to fill 14.5
Olympic-sized swimming pools. It likewise
saved energy equivalent to the amount
needed to light and run Mondelez Philippines
for 4.3 months. Notably, the company also
prevented carbon emissions equivalent to 137

NEW TECHNOLOGY
TO TREAT WASTEWATER

With Cebu I.T. Park’s increasing number of new
developments, the volume of wastewater it
generates has significantly increased. To ensure
the compliant quality of effluent discharge,
owner CHI and subsidiary Cebu Property
Ventures and Development Corporation
(CPVDC) began the construction in 2015 of
a mechanized treatment facility using the
Sequence Batch Reactor (SBR) Technology.

An SBR is an activated sludge system that
works based on sequential stages of treatment.
It is programed by time rather than space as
would a conventional activated sludge system.
With SBR, wastewater will first pass through
the Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR), thereby
separating oil, grease, and grit from the stream.

The P200 million-investment started in
August 2015 and covers a five million liters
per day (MLD) flow capacity. The first SBR
was scheduled for completion in 2016, while
another 5-MLD flow capacity (Phase 2) SBR is
set for 2017, requiring another P200 million in
investment.

The system ensures compliant quality of
effluent discharge and helps prevent pollution
in waste water systems. It contributes to SDG
6, clean water and sanitation, particularly on
wastewater treatment as very few integrated,
master-planned and mixed-use communities
have their own centralized sewage treatment
facilities.

Makati Development Corporation (MDC)
was the general contractor for the project
while Manila Water Total Solutions conducted
the study on the wastewater treatment
requirements of the Cebu IT Park.

WATER PRINCIPLES IN ACTION

Nestlé Philippines grows millions of coffee
plantlets every year at its five seedling centers:
in Lipa, Bukidnon, Quirino, Davao del Norte and
South Cotabato.

During farmer training, the Company imparts
knowledge to farmers to conserve water
through the use of plastic as mulch and
coverings to retain soil moisture; contour
farming to prevent water run-off and reduce
soil erosion; planting of crops in between rows
to conserve soil moisture and maximize land
productivity; water impounding ponds to catch
rain water; check dams to reduce water and
soil run-off; and water meters and sprinklers to
control the release of water.

337
billion liters of water were returned to
the environment from replenishment
and treated wastewater projects by
Coca-Cola FEMSA

In addition, farmers are trained at the seedling
centers on the best available coffee farming
technologies, including ways to more efficiently

water their crops. Nestlé’s continues to develop
water conservation practices for its own
operations and that of the farmers.

Within its manufacturing sites, Nestlé has
put in place rainwater harvesting systems,
technologies to reuse and recycle water, and
waste water treatment plants. Two of Nestlé
factories are zero waste to discharge factories.
Despite increase in production, water intensity
or the volume of water withdrawn over the
metric tons of product manufactured, was
maintained. Water intensity was 6.56 cubic
meter per metric tonnes of product in 2015 and
6.62 cubic meter per metric tonnes of product
in 2016.

Coca-Cola FEMSA Philippines Inc., Coca-Cola
Company’s licensed bottling partner, also
aims to reduce consumption and implement
processes that ensure efficient water use by
reducing water usage ratio per every liter of
beverage product. From a global water use
ratio of 2.62 liters, Coca-Cola in the Philippines
is now at an average of 2.2 liters of water use
per every liter of beverage product.
In 2016 alone, an investment of over USD 4
million paved way to top-of-the-line waste
water treatment facilities in various Coca-Cola
manufacturing plants in the country. These
facilities will help optimize the use of water, the
re-use water resources, and the return to the
environment, cleaner that its original state.

CHANGING THE WAY WE CONSUME AND SUPPLY

Over the years, Starbucks has launched several
initiatives to decrease the environmental
impact of its disposable cups. It has developed
recyclable cup solutions and employed
marketing and product development
strategies to increase the use of personal
reusable cups by regular clients.

and beverage businesses, recyclers, NGOs, and
academic experts.

Similarly, Universal Robina Corporation (URC)
uses recyclables for its packaging materials
such as PET and Polypropylene. It also
incorporates at least 5% of PET regrind during
bottle production.

URC reincorporates some byproducts
of its manufacturing processes,
e.g. candy mass and chocolate trimmings
back to the production process in order
to minimize wastage

In addition, Starbucks uses recycled-content
cup sleeves, hot beverage paper cups with
10% post-consumer recycled fiber, and new
plastic cups with less environmental impact
than their previous plastic cups. Customers
who drink their beverages in the store are also
encouraged to use a ceramic mug.
With better paper products and consumers
engaged in sustainability action, Starbucks
ensures less waste and a higher recycling rate.
Their partners come from the paper and plastic
cup value chain including municipalities, raw

its manufacturing processes such as candy
mass and chocolate trimmings back to the
production process in order to minimize
wastage. It also uses some by-products of its
flour production like bran and pollard into
animal feeds.

Griffin’s, a New Zealand brand distributed by
URC, separates food waste into high protein,
starch, dry product, and wet product. This
allows Griffin’s to earn revenue from waste
materials and recycle starch into raw material
for packaging products. All product waste is
moved to farms for stock feed. Griffin’s waste
oil is broken down and used as biodiesel.
Pallets that are removed from site are broken

GREEN DEALING
AND PURCHASING

Honda Cars Philippines’ (HCPI) Green
Purchasing program draws mutual
management support and continued
collaboration between Honda and its suppliers
through an environmental management
system. Shared goals to reduce emissions and
ensure compliance to chemical guidelines also
prods Honda to work closely with its business
partners.

By having shared quality assurance rules and
recognition for outstanding performance,
mandatory EMS for suppliers, regular audit,
and training, Honda was able to address quality
problems, achieve better use of resource
materials, reduce carbon emissions, and ensure
compliance to government regulations. This

continued quality improvement and lower
environmental impact also resulted in cost
competitiveness and manpower motivation.
Meanwhile, its Green Dealer Program is a
monitoring and certification system that guides
Honda’s Dealership Network in implementing
activities that reduce the environmental
impact of its operations. As dealers become
aware of their environmental impact and
take action to reduce them, they are able to
improve their operations, conserve energy and
water resources, and provide a safe working
environment for their employees. With an
actual cost of P750,000 from 2012 to 2016, the
program continues to build capability through
training, while recognizing outstanding
performance and ensuring environmental
compliance through audits. It has also helped
position Honda’s brand as an environmentally
responsible company that produces high
quality products.

INFLUENCING THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Launched in 2000, Greening the Supply Chain
is an initiative of Nestlé Philippines to promote
environmentally friendly practices among
the company’s business partners by helping
them formulate and implement their own
Environmental Management Systems (EMS).

At the core of the program are technical
assistance and training programs for all of
Nestlé’s business partners. For instance, the

company took the lead in mounting seminars
and workshops for vendors and suppliers.
These introduced them to EMS concepts,
as well as better mechanisms for planning,
implementation, and audit and review.
To date, 240 business partners participate in
this program generating the establishment of
multiple EMS and environmental programs.
This created a multiplier effect that boosted
environmental protection throughout Nestlé’s
supply chain while realizing significant
operational efficiencies and cost savings for
more business ventures.

Gaps and Opportunities

79

While the business sector is seen as doing
more of its share to contribute to the
achievement of the SDGs, there is still more to
be done. For instance, low compliance to the
Ecological Solid Waste Management Act leads
to limited awareness of communities on waste
segregation, recycling, composting.

Although rural areas generate less waste than
urban areas, the residents of these areas end
up dumping or burning their garbage if left
without useful information and means to
practice more responsible waste management.
To address this, the private sector, especially
those active in rural areas, should also target
partnerships with host communities or LGUs
hosting their facilities.

There is also a system to check compliance of
LGUs with the law through the Office of the
Ombudsman. But without a more adequate
system for rewards and sanctions, non-
compliant LGUs or companies may end up
canceling out any headway accomplished by
those committed to contributing to the SDGs.

There are also plenty of opportunities to
scale up the current initiatives narrated in
this section. One is by aggregating initiatives
within corporation’s business units. CHI’s
Agbayay Para sa Kalikupan, to cite one
example, can be replicated by Ayala Land in its

other subsidiaries and sister companies.
Another opportunity is to further develop
networks for collaboration. Starbucks can
explore new links with nearby MRFs, backyard
farms, and schools, among others, to ensure
waste diversion and promote heightened
reuse. Unilever and P&G and other companies
can also partner with the Municipal or City
Environment and Natural Resources Office
(MENRO/CENRO) in plastic waste collection
and with cooperatives (e.g. Bazura Bags) to
upcycle the collected materials as material
input for their business.

Finally, there is knowledge and technology
sharing. Developing venues for exchange
ensures best practices are shared and an
environment-conscious business culture is
encouraged. Knowledge and technology
sharing also channel effective participation
and collective action, which can lead to more
meaningful and impactful contributions, ideas,
and innovations.

Scaling up requires direction from top
management and collaboration across
industries. Being able to move toward this
end can also be a good measure for maturity
as environmental goals rise to the same
level of priority in the business agenda, as
competitiveness and growth.

UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change threatens the lives of everyone
around the world. But its effects are felt
most by vulnerable populations like women,
children, and the elderly, and by those who
live in regions susceptible to drastic changes in
the environment. Food and water will become
scarcer. People’s livelihoods will be at risk,
threatening to negate the gains of poverty
alleviation efforts, and in other SDGs, unless
immediate collective actions are taken.

Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide
(CO2) and other greenhouse gases continue
to rise. These emissions are causing long-
lasting changes to our planet’s climate system.
Rising average surface temperatures, extreme
weather events, changing rainfall patterns,
rising sea levels, and increased ocean acidity
are all being observed.

According to the 2016 Global Climate Risk
Index, the Philippines was one of the nations
most affected by extreme weather events from
1995 to 2014. In 2013, the country ranked
first when Typhoon Haiyan slammed the
archipelago, resulting in 6,000 deaths and over
$13 billion in losses.

coast and are vulnerable to storm surges and
rising sea levels. Up to 60% of the total land
area is exposed to multiple hazards.

While the Philippines accounts for only 0.4% of
global greenhouse gas emissions, this number
is expected to rise as the country continues
with its recent rapid growth. The energy sector
is the biggest contributor to these emissions,
followed by agriculture, and to a lesser degree,
waste and industrial processes, based on a
recent inventory of Philippines greenhouse gas
emissions.

The country seeks to limit these emissions
as part of its obligations under The Paris
Agreement, a landmark accord reached by
196 parties, which aims to limit the impact
of climate change through concrete actions.
The Agreement was recently ratified by the
Philippine President and concurred in by
the Senate. The Philippines government
has also undertaken several initiatives on
climate change, such as the National Greening
Program, National Renewable Energy Plan, and
the National Climate Change Action Plan for
2011-2018.

The Philippines ranked third among 171
countries most at risk of disasters based on the
World Risk Report 2016. With no natural land
barriers to protect it against climate impact,
the country is highly vulnerable to such
extreme weather conditions. About 70% of
our 1,500 municipalities are located along the

Matching these initiatives are innovative
programs undertaken by the private
sector, which seek to contribute to climate
risk preparedness and reduction through
technology, and climate risk mitigation
through innovative products and energy-
efficient business models.

Private Sector Initiatives in
DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY
FOR CLIMATE RISK
PREPAREDNESS AND REDUCTION

In response to the wake of natural disasters
that hit the Philippines year after the year,
businesses have taken the lead with initiatives
that seek to build the adaptive capacity
and increase the resilience of communities
through advanced technology, information
and education, and communication. Having an
informed population with sufficient awareness
on how to respond before and after a natural
disaster happens is key to saving lives.

Every year, the country loses an average of 1,000
lives due to natural disasters. Most deaths are
attributed to typhoons, which are naturally
occurring at least 20 times per year. Among
natural disasters, typhoons are also the leading
cause of economic loss, with the economy losing
an average of USD151.3 million every year.

The advent of super-typhoons showed
significant gaps in the country’s disaster
response and management system despite the
government’s solid and functioning disaster
risk reduction and management structure.
Government response was revealed to be
mainly slow and reactive. Local government
units lacked communication and warning
systems thereby weakening mechanisms on
evacuation and on search and rescue.

Companies like Shell Philippines Exploration
BV, Aboitiz Group, Smart Communications,
PLDT Inc., Globe Telecom, and Honda Cars
Philippines have come in to fill this gap and
assist local governments in building their
capability in disaster preparedness. Many of
their initiatives, at the same time, also play
a role in disaster prevention and mitigation
through weather forecasting and early warning
systems technology, and in disaster response,
rehabilitation and recovery through improved
relief and recovery operations in affected areas.

WEATHER STATIONS
AND MOBILE APPS

All across the globe, weather has become
unpredictable as a result of climate change.
The amount of rain and snow has changed
dramatically. Powerful storms and extreme
heat are on the rise. At this point, although
we can’t stop a severe weather event from
happening, we can minimize the damage that
may result from it. Disaster risk reduction in
the face of such unusual and erratic weather
requires the adoption of measures, such as
early warning, that increase preparedness and
the ability to respond properly.

19,562
users with access to disaster warnings,
advisories, location data, and disaster
mappings and safety guides

This is exactly what SPEX sought to do when
it launched Response to Communities under
Emergency (RESCUE) in Palawan. The company
observed that the province lacked organized
groups trained in disaster management
including first aid, evacuation, and rescue.
The situation is further complicated by the
lack of accurate weather information in the
region. To resolve this, SPEX took the lead in
installing 16 community-based Automated
Weather Stations in key municipalities of
Palawan. The stations collect weather data
that are accessible, relevant, and timely to a
lot of people, particularly those involved in

agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and energy.
The stations also proved useful in educating
people about the weather and climate change,
and in training them on disaster preparedness.
The trainings were undertaken in partnership
with local government units, city health
offices, coast guard, the police, the education
department, transportation bureaus, and
peoples organizations in Palawan. To date,
more than 500 people learned Weather 101,
Tropical Cyclone 101, Basic Life Support,
and Rescue and Survival, among others. For
these trainings, RESCUE initially targeted
communities and schools where Shell
operates, but it has since reached out to
neighboring barangays and municipalities.

With schools serving as evacuation centers
in many instances, RESCUE decided to reach
out as well to teachers and their students.
A Junior RESCUE program teaches children
and the youth to become the company’s
partner in safety and security. By making
them knowledgeable about fire safety, road
safety, first aid, and disaster preparedness,
children become less vulnerable in times of
emergencies.

For its part, the Aboitiz Group through
WeatherPhilippines Foundation uses localized
weather information to help the most
vulnerable sectors prepare before an extreme
weather event happens. Its #WeatherWiser
Nation campaign engages businesses, local
government units, and technologically savvy
Filipinos and educate them on the benefits
of a useful, practical, and reliable weather
knowledge using its three-pronged strategy of
technology, partnerships, and engagement.

CONTINUITY OF
COMMUNICATIONS

Communication networks and infrastructure
are typically down whenever a strong typhoon
or an extreme natural hazard strikes. Loved
ones are unable to update one another and
responders encounter difficulty attending to
urgent needs due to lack of communication.

To address this problem, Smart
Communications created SafePH, an integrated
disaster response solution which immediately
restores communication by providing mobile
satellite services and quickly reactivating
damaged cellular networks. PLDT works with
other companies in order to come up with
interim network solutions. As a result, SafePH
served a total of 7,562 typhoon affected

families in 2015. Aside from providing free call
stations, it also facilitated relief operations for
these affected families.

Globe Telecom supported the development
of hazard maps for 54 out of 81 Philippine
provinces, which will be used by Phivolcs
to assist the provinces in their disaster
management plans. The company also
reinforced Ayala ASSIST, an app that enables
Ayala employees to easily seek assistance
during disasters. This makes it easier to alert
employees in times of emergency, for people
managers to account for their employees, and
to request for help. One of the mechanisms
adopted by Globe is the transmittal of free
mobile alerts through SMS, warning customers
of potential danger coming from typhoons.
As part of its public service program, Globe
provides Libreng Tawag, Charging and Internet
services during calamities.

RESEARCH AND EDUCATION

The more the public is prepared for the
eventuality of a disaster, the more lives and
property are saved. Risks from disasters can
be mitigated with knowledge, education, and
ingenuity. The application of measures and
procedures should rely and be integrated with
a thorough assessment of the nature of today’s
weather events, the likelihood of disasters and
their consequences, and the understanding of
vulnerabilities, capabilities, and resources.

A major step in this area of risk assessment
is the study by Shell International on how
Marikina City can be transformed into a resilient
institution able to withstand and respond to
various threats. Faced with perennial floods
and the prospect of a major earthquake due to
the presence of the Marikina Valley Faultline,
the study made use of Shell’s Scenarios
Process to come up with an action plan for
the development of policies and projects
that can deal with the twin challenges of
urbanisation and climate change. The study
was a collaboration among the Marikina City
Administration, Metropolitan MMDA, European
Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines
(ECCP), League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP),
Clean Air Asia, Meralco, and OneRenewable.

Risks from disasters can be mitigated with
knowledge, education, and inegenuity

Meanwhile, Smart Communications provided
connectivity solutions to Manila Observatory’s
automated weather stations found in Shell
gas stations all over the country. This research
project called Partnership for Resilience aims
to collect weather/climate data for scientific
analysis. Smart also organized a series of
Regional Communications Summits in
partnership with the National Disaster Risk

Reduction Management Council in order to
promote multi-channel communications in
times of calamities.

Honda Cars Philippines invested P5 million
in the last five years to educate one million
drivers on eco-safe driving. The program seeks
to influence driver behavior in relation climate
change mitigation, fuel efficiency, clean air,
and road safety. It gives drivers practical tips
on how proper driving habits and regular
vehicle maintenance help keep the car running
smoothly and safely while helping to reduce
air pollution and CO2 emissions. If each of the
initially targeted one million driver saves half
a liter of fuel a day for one year, CO2 emissions
may be reduced to 430,000 tonnes per 180
million liters of fuel saved. To date, around
59,000 drivers have attended the seminars and
hands-on training and viewed the eco-safe
driving videos. The online awareness campaign
in Facebook, Youtube, on the other hand
reached more than 2.5 million people.

The Aboitiz Group, through the
WeatherPhilippines Foundation, has
established 577 strategic partnerships with
big conglomerates and non-governmental
organzations, and trained 3,324 national
agency and local government personnel in
81 provinces including Palawan where it has
partnered with Shell Philippines Exploration
BV. These trainings are complemented
by layman-friendly educational content,
accessible through its website weatherph.

Further, WeatherPhilippines partnered with
Pilmico Foods Corporation in the production
of Weather Wizards, a five-episode animation
series. The serialized videos will be used by
DepEd to help promote the advocacy among
the Filipino youth.

mitigation projects and programs, the Center
has developed an interdisciplinary and cross-
sectoral network of climate researchers,
academics and practitioners in the Philippines
and in 9 other countries to enhance the
understanding and prediction of climate
change and geo-hazard impacts. Its programs

consist of: a) awarding research and thesis
grants, b) building networks and partnerships,
c) fostering capacity building and best practices
and d) deployment of enabling solutions. The
Center has supported 17 climate researches/
grants at a total cost of P 25.8M in these initial
years. For 2015 and 2016, it has partnered with
the Climate Change Commission to produce
the “Philippine Climate Change Assessment
Report” to guide government and the public in
their decisions.

INNOVATING PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS MODELS FOR CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION

Climate change is the new normal and
businesses will need to adopt bold changes
to protect not just public lives and economic
gains but also their own investments.

Extreme and unpredictable weather events
have a direct impact on production and
commerce. In some cases, the catastrophic
effects of today’s weather can lead to massive
loss of assets and even the complete cessation
of business operations. Companies with
business operations in countries like the
Philippines are particularly vulnerable.

Euro-4 vehicles release 50% less harmful
air emissions than vehicles with
Euro-2 standards

Companies thus have to re-evaluate how
their operations impact the environment and
undertake steps that can reduce or minimize
this impact. An inventory of Philippine
greenhouse gas emissions, for example, shows
that the energy sector accounts for about 70
million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, or 55% of the
share in greenhouse gases. These emissions
from the energy sector are increasing at a rate
of 0.6% per year.

Oil remains the country’s major source of
energy, accounting for 32.2% of the energy
mix, followed by coal at 23.1%. The country’s
energy self-sufficiency level is still below the
60% target in 2015. The Department of Energy
has accelerated the implementation of energy
efficiency and conservation (EEC) initiatives
through the accreditation of 15 energy service

companies in March 2016. In 2015, the country
saved 5 million tonnes of oil equivalent energy
through various EEC programs.

More needs to be done, however, to lessen the
country’s dependence on fossil fuels. Strides
are being made in transitioning to renewable
energy sources. Businesses can also do more
by transitioning to a low-carbon pathway.
They need to decarbonize their operations and
supply chains by setting ambitious emissions
reduction targets, improving energy use and
efficiency, and by enlarging investments in

innovative low-carbon products and services.

Companies like Honda Cars Philippines Inc.,
Pacific Paint (Boysen) Philippines, Philips
Philippines, De La Salle University – Dasmarinas,
Cebu Holdings, Inc., Shell Shared Services
(Asia), B.V., Nestlé Philippines, Mondelez
Philippines, and PLDT, Inc. are demonstrating
how this is possible with great imagination
and determination. Their initiatives show
how switching to green products and green
business models may help mitigate the impact
of climate change.

GREEN PRODUCTS

Consumers are less likely to think about a
product’s impact to climate change whenever
they make a purchase. Foremost in every
consumer’s mind is how useful the product
is and how much it costs. Some companies
have chosen to be proactive instead and have
now assumed the worry about a product’s
ecological impact by introducing green
products into the market. Today, the availability
of green products helps to make consumers
aware about climate change and how their
habits and purchases may be contributing
to it. These products now empower them to
make choices that promote health and the
environment.

For example, by introducing Euro-4 vehicles
in 2004, Honda Cars Philippines made CO2
emissions as a factor in deciding which

cars to buy. These vehicles release 50% less
harmful air emissions compared to vehicles
that passed only Euro-2 standards. To date,
Honda has sold more than 192,870 units of
Euro-4 compliant vehicles. In September 2015,
Honda was awarded Euro-4 certification by
the Department of Environment and Natural
Resource for all of its models, ahead of the
government’s January 2018 deadline.

Another green product currently available
in the market is the light-emitting diode
(LED) bulb by Philips Philippines. This new
bulb saves energy by 85% compared to an
incandescent bulb and 20% compared to a
compact fluorescent lamp. It also reduces a
household’s carbon emissions by about 50-
70%. Philips created the LED bulb in response
to the Department of Energy’s call for energy
conservation following the 2015 power crisis.
The company estimates that about 50% of bulb
users in the country are now using LED.

SWITCHING TO GREEN BULBS

Among the increasing number of users of LED
lights are businesses and institutions making
a big switch in favor of the environment. They
have recognized that using LED helps them
to reduce their carbon footprint while making
huge savings on electricity expenses.

CHI’s Street Lighting Conversion
Program generated savings of about
P30,000 per month

De La Salle University - Dasmariñas (DLSU-D)
is replacing gradually all fluorescent lamps
with LED as part of its ongoing Project Carbon
Neutral program called “Black Out! Green
In!” The program aims to position DLSU-D as
a carbon-neutral university by integrating
sustainable habits and practices in every
section of DLSU-D—instruction, research,
operations, and extensions. Aside from
investing in LED, the program also includes
the installation of solar panels, energy
conservation measures such as maximized
used of natural light, reducing use of paper,
making the university a bike-friendly and
pedestrian-friendly zone, planting more
than 120,000 native Philippines trees for the

past five years, and having a comprehensive
waste management program which includes
recycling wastewater and rainwater to reduce
dependence on ground water.
By investing in carbon-neutral practices, the
university made significant savings on annual
expenses, generated direct income from
sustainable practices, and added value and
prestige to DLSU-D. More important, carbon
footprint went down from 90,284 tonnes in
2011 to 70,016 tonnes in 2015. Per capita
carbon footprint went down from 636 kg in
2011 to 533 kg in 2015. In 2016, DLSU-D was
recognized as the greenest university in the
Philippines, 10th in Asia and 50th in the world
according to the Greenmetric World Ranking of
Universities.

Meanwhile, CHI has completed the first phase
of its Street Lighting Conversion Program inside
the Cebu Business Park and Cebu IT Park. The
conversion of street lights from conventional
325 Watt high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps to
LED reduced CO2 emissions by an average of
930 kg per month. The move also made savings
averaging 12% of monthly consumption,
or about P30,000 per month. CHI aims to
complete this LED retrofit by 2017.

Shell Shared Services (Asia), B.V. invested
P40.6 million in Project Luntian, another
initiative which seeks to replace fluorescent

lamps with LED. While it appears as a simple
office improvement project, the replacement
of lighting fixtures in all work areas of the
Shell Business Operations office in Manila
considerably helps reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. Total annual reduction in electricity
consumption resulted in an equivalent
reduction of CO2 emissions by 1,100 tonnes.
Moreover, mercury content released as a
result of frequent busted light replacement
was reduced by 32,500 milligrams. It has also
significantly minimized working at height
safety risks for technical staff and contractors
due to busted lamp replacement activities as
LEDs have significantly longer burning hours
compared to fluorescent lamps. By switching to
LED, Shell’s electricity consumption went down
to 15% every month, generating P9.6 million in
savings per year. Project Luntian demonstrates
how Shell is committed to contributing to the
global effort for addressing climate change.

CLEAN FUELS
AND ENERGY CONSERVATION

The continued use of fossil fuels, such as coal
and gas, have been proven detrimental to
the environment. Most businesses and cities
continue to rely on fossil fuels because they
remain abundant, reliable, and inexpensive.
However, some are now making the big
switch to cleaner fuels in order to power their
businesses. Clean fuel is increasingly taking
a significant share in the energy mix used by
manufacturing companies.

One such company is Nestlé. The company now
puts a premium on the use of clean fuel in its
factories in Cagayan de Oro and has invested
significantly in renewable energy sources such
as spent coffee grounds, solar, and hydropower.
Coffee waste is used in Nestlé’s biomass plant
that transforms this waste into energy.

Mondelez Philippines’ Go Green Program
eliminated carbon emissions equivalent
to 137 plane trips from Manila to
Australia and back

Recycling the company’s waste into energy
resources has resulted in annual savings in
waste hauling and dumping costs, reduced
waste down to zero. The ash by product from
this process is mixed with the sludge from
the factory’s waste water treatment and is
converted into soil conditioner that is then
given to coffee farmers. The factory uses
150,000 kg of spent coffee grounds per day
which can produce 20 ton per hour steam
energy. This gives an annual savings of more

It also saved enough energy to light and run its
plants for 4.3 months.
Meanwhile, Honda Cars Philippines has opted
to use demand management and advanced
energy efficient technologies in order to
optimize energy use and reduce emissions
from manufacturing. Over the last three years,
it reduced CO2 emissions by an average of
70 tonnes per year. From 2015 to 2016, it
reduced such emissions by 158 tonnes. In 2016,
it invested P10 million in this program but
generated approximately the same amount

Gaps and Opportunities

Government and policy makers need to get
more businesses engaged in the climate
change agenda. The innovative examples
shown here demonstrate the willingness
of companies to contribute to climate risk
preparedness, reduction, and mitigation.
CEOs are ready to do more but information
has to be broadly disseminated as businesses
want greater clarity and consistency in
policymaking. An enabling environment must
also be created to gather critical input from
the private sector and provide them with
incentives for good corporate citizenship. This
way, it becomes easier to convince companies,
for example, to set higher targets for emissions
reduction and to disclose relevant information
on these emissions.

Companies will also have to be more forward
looking given how the business environment
has changed as a result of climate change.
Extreme weather disturbances have had
serious financial consequences to many
businesses, big or small. They need to go
beyond the capacity-building of personnel or
the development of platforms for gathering
and spreading information. This means looking
within their own fences and doing more
extensive risk management in order to build

resilience in their assets and supply chain. For
example, a simple interruption in the supply of
raw materials due to bad weather may severely
compromise business continuity. Micro-
enterprises and small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs), which act mostly as distributors
of goods, are vulnerable to these scenarios
because of limited access to coping strategies.

Big companies and government can start
working with micro-insurance companies
like Cebuana Lhuillier, which now provides
coverage for MSMEs to protect their businesses
from natural disasters. Other possible
opportunities in this area include opening or
expanding into new markets, adopting risk
reduction measures for physical operations,
and developing resilience-oriented goods,
finance, and services. Doing resilience studies
of vulnerable areas needs to be prioritized.

Finally, businesses should build on the
momentum generated by existing initiatives
on climate change. For example, De La Salle
University may consider expanding the scope
of Project Carbon Neutral to affiliates and
institutions of the DLSU system other than
their campus in Dasmariñas.

As one of 18 mega-biodiverse countries in the
planet, the Philippines has so much to gain
from its wealth of flora and fauna. The country
is home to two-thirds of the earth’s biodiversity
with the third largest reef area in the world.

With all this bounty, the country is also one
of the world’s biodiversity and conservation
hotspots with at least 700 threatened species.
Recent DENR satellite data also show that our
forest covers continue to diminish as the rate
of forest product consumption far exceeds
reforestation rates.

Given these challenges, many companies are
now recognizing that biodiversity is linked to
business capital and any brand’s intrinsic value
proposition. This is evident in how the private
sector has played an increasingly pivotal role in
protecting our forests and wealth of animal and
plant life over the past decades.

In addressing biodiversity targets, companies
would inevitably touch on other sustainability
goals such as food security, water and
sanitation, and sustainable settlements. This
attests to the significance of biodiversity and
natural capital as a foundation of our socio-
economic growth.

Private Sector Initiatives on
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION

REFORESTATION
AND BIODIVERSITY
CONSERVATION PROGRAMS

The generation of clean and renewable
energy inherently supports programs that
directly benefit the environment. It is thus no
surprise that one of the leading renewable
energy companies in the country— the Energy
Development Corporation (EDC)—also has
one of the most extensive sustainable forestry
programs by a private firm.

EDC is deputized by the government to protect
its geothermal watershed reservations since
1984. In addition to law enforcement to protect
standing natural forests, as early as 1989 EDC
has partnered with forest communities that
have tenure in the watershed reservations to
reforest denuded areas. In 2009, it accelerated
its reforestation program using indigenous tree
species under the “BINH” Program which aims
to restore 10,000 hectares of denuded lands in
10 years across its project sites. Now on its 8th
year, the program has restored 8,964 hectares
of denuded forest lands with the help of local
communities with a total investment of more
than P300 million.
Because of the BINHI program, EDC has bridged
forest gaps, protected more than 300 species
of birds, mammals and reptiles, preserved 937

species of native trees and maintained the
integrity and ecosystem services of 127,608
hectares of forest lands within the geothermal
reservations. In addition, EDC has partnered
with 88 farmer-associations in implementing
the program and in ensuring that these natural
assets are protected and maintained.

Another noteworthy program of EDC is the
Biodiversity Conservation and Monitoring
Program (BCMP) which aims to set baselines
and assess the impact of its operation to
sensitive species. The program includes
the regular monitoring of flora, fauna and
freshwater organisms within the project sites.
The program also monitors the population and
behavior of selected endemic and endangered
species by identifying flagship species such as
the flying foxes (bats) in its Bicol site; the flying
lemurs in its Leyte site; and the Philippine eagle
in its Mindanao site.

From a business vantage point, EDC has
achieved stable ecosystem services, such as
sustaining the geothermal recharge, protection
of natural habitat, continued provision of
forest goods for forest dwellers and mitigating
the impacts of climate change. In addition,
EDC credits enhanced cooperation of local
communities to address watershed challenges—
as well as improved relations and reputation
among stakeholders—as key business results of
its large-scale green programs.

INNOVATIONS
IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
AND SOIL MANAGEMENT

In 1999, Dr. Justino R. Arboleda of Bicol
University College of Agriculture founded a
coconut fiber production company, which
would produce anti-soil erosion products. The
company sought to make profit by directly
addressing three distinct developmental
challenges—soil erosion, the large volume
of coconut husks being considered as waste,
and the meager income of coconut farmers.
Today, Arboleda’s company Coco Technologies
Corp. (Coco Tech) is recognized as a pioneer
not only in coconut husk processing, but
also in espousing a business model that
directly benefits the environment and poor
communities.

The company’s anti-soil erosion products
are six times cheaper and more effective
than concrete. Coco Tech was also able to

innovate and make use of coco dust produced
from decorticating coconut husks. Out of
these waste materials, Coco Tech produces
organic fertilizers that are estimated to be
four times cheaper than inorganic ones. They
also last longer and contain more micro-
nutrients. Through continuous research and
development, Coco Tech also successfully
innovated low-cost housing fiber boards and
coco fiber mattresses.

Able to engage poor communities both from
the supply and demand sides of the business
equation, Coco Tech has been able to provide
steady livelihood opportunities for poor
farmers, home-based female entrepreneurs,
and even the elderly, who are paid to twine
and weave coco fibers at their own homes.
Starting with an initial investment of P3.5
million, the company’s assets grew to P10.6
million in 2005 to P84 million in 2015. It has
provided livelihood to 1,500 families, covered
more than 2.6 million square meters of
bioengineered slopes, and prevented flooding
in thousands of households.

PROTECTING ENDANGERED SPECIES

In line with the SDG targets to fight poaching
and trafficking of protected species, companies
such as Boysen Paints are leading the way in
ensuring that some of our rarest animal species
are shielded from harm and extinction.

Boysen Paints has long been identified with the
eagle. Its first corporate logo, inherited from the
original Walter N. Boysen Paint Company in the
United States, was the American bald eagle. To
celebrate its Philippine heritage, the company
changed its logo to the Philippine eagle, a
giant forest raptor considered one of the three
largest and most powerful eagles in the world.
It is also one of the world’s rarest and most
critically endangered vertebrate species. The
two main threats to its survival are poaching
and deforestation.

With Boysen’s support, the Philippine Eagle
Foundation is able to continue combating
the fast decline of this eagle. The foundation
cares for injured birds, raises hatchlings for
reintroduction to the wild, and works closely
with communities for the proper care and
protection of this critical species.

This corporate campaign goes beyond public
relations, as Boysen also follows best practices
in environment, health, and safety standards.
One of the first paint factory in the country
to receive the ISO 14001:2004 Environmental
Management Certification, signifying that
its operations are at par with international
standards for environmental management.

INVESTING ON MARINE BIODIVERSITY

The Philippines has one of the world’s longest
coastlines in the world with about 36,000 km.
Our reefs host 464 species of hard corals and
1,770 species of fish. These support numerous
coastal communities for livelihood which in
turn feed the entire country with the bounty of
the sea. This high rate of biodiversity and long
coastline make it a hotspot for illegal activities
and a challenging region for law enforcement.

Together with multi-sectoral partners, the
private sector has found ways to help protect
our marine life and spearhead efforts to
enhance it.

MARINE LAW ENFORCEMENT:
The ‘Center of the Center’

Acting on the results of an in-depth study,
First Gen partnered with First Philippine
Conservation, Inc. and Conservation
International for a groundbreaking marine
biodiversity protection project called “Center
of the Center.”

The said study, conducted by scientists from
the Smithsonian Institution in 2004, revealed
the high significance of the Verde Island
Passage as a prime center of marine life,
leading the scientists behind it to call it the
“Center of the Center of Marine Biodiversity” in
the world.

The strait, which crosses areas of Batangas, also
separates Luzon and Mindoro and connects
the South China Sea with the Tayabas Bay and
the Sibuyan Sea. It is also home to to a vast
marine ecosystem, whose diversity surpassed
even those of Australia and Indonesia. But as a
result of rapid industrialization, poaching, and
destructive fishing methods, a good number
of fish species there were already facing
extinction.

All these prompted First Gen to act quickly
in 2004 alongside other concerned groups
through community organizing, research,
training and capability building, and marine
protected area identification. Today, First Gen
remains an advocate of the Center of the
Center (COC) Program by providing support to
the community-based marine law enforcement
volunteer group Bantay Dagat (Sea Patrol) in
the 15 municipalities/ city of the Province of
Batangas. The teams conduct investigative
trips to enforce marine laws, regulate divers
by monitoring diving permits, assist in diving
accidents, and monitor fishing activities for any
evidence of illegal methods.

With an investment that has now reached
around P37.5 million, First Gen has been
able to secure 2,702 hectares of highly rich
marine protected areas in partnership with
the Provincial Government of Batangas. This
project has also led to the enactment of
Executive Order No. 578 establishing a national
policy on biodiversity and the creation of the
first Global Marine Species Assessment (GMSA)
Office in Asia Pacific.

Aboitiz Equity Ventures has so far infested
around P13 million in a biodiversity park
and learning facility at Sitio Punta Dumalag,
Matina Aplaya, Davao City. Dubbed as the
Aboitiz Cleanergy Park, this eight hectare
property serves as a sanctuary for the critically
endangered hawksbill turtle (locally known as
Pawikan), thus allowing diverse ecosystems to
flourish even in an urban setting.
According to the company, the park also
provides a unique environmental education

opportunity because of its proximity to the city
proper.

Through a partnership with DENR, this Aboitiz
initiative has already resulted in the release
of 2,503 turtle hatchlings. It has likewise
encouraged the many different stakeholders
like the local government units and agencies,
the academe, private companies and
individuals to support the preservation of
the sanctuary. Tree planting also is one of the
activities that the supporters actively promote
to help propagate coastal trees particularly
mangoves that attract many different bird
species which have lately been noted to
increase in number.

NOTABLE PARTNERSHIPS

Smart Communications Inc.’s DALOY 3546 is
a great example of how public-private sector
synergies can yield significant results for our
sea bodies and marine life.

DALOY stands for Dedicated Alert Lines for
Ocean Biodiversity. It is a hotline managed by
the Philippine National Police-Maritime Group
(PNP-MG) together with USAID-ECOFISH,
which uses Smart’s telecommunications
network. It serves as an efficient way for
citizens to report illegal fishing and marine
wildlife trafficking crimes anonymously.

Globe signed a Memorandum of Agreement
(MoA) with Hineleban for a five-year
Reforestation Program composed of three
key components, nalmely: reforestation,
food security, and sustainable livelihood
development.

DALOY 3456 use web and SMS technology
to send reports, store messages, and analyze
data for better policies and more strategic
government actions concerning marine-
related activities. Illegal fishing and marine
wildlife trafficking are often detected and
witnessed in coastal communities but the
government fails to curb these crimes due to
weak and inadequate law enforcement.

With the use of Smart’s available technology,
maritime police officers have been mobilized

to respond to marine violations reported and
sent to the DALOY System. The hotline also
provided valuable information that helps the
work of several inter-agency operations (local
government units, police, etc.) and improved
coordination among the different maritime
protection agencies in the pilot area of Tawi-
Tawi. The project also aims to be launched in
different parts of the country as well.

PROTECTING
A WORLD HERITAGE SITE

Shell Philippines Exploration BV, has a
program which sustains conservation gains in
the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park—a UNESCO
World Heritage Site that is home to about
10,000 hectares of coral reef and is extremely
rich in marine life.

Shell has provided financial resources to
enable the effective management of this
global center of marine biodiversity. The
company has also supported information

drives that strengthen conservation efforts
among nearby communities and in areas
where illegal fishing activities are high.

Aside from its educational impact, which
has now reached 41 coastal communities
and yielded several scientific research
outputs, the program also enhances Shell
Philippines’ reputation as a supporter of
critical environmental issues. According to
the company, this program is also a testament
to the global Shell brand’s commitment to
the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO
to exclude World Heritage Sites from energy
exploration and extraction.

MOVING FORWARD

Clearly, the private sector has a lot to gain
from protecting biodiversity, especially for
industries such as energy, real-estate, and
tourism, which rely on the sustainable use
of land and marine life to remain viable as a
business.

In partnership with the government and
scientific groups, companies can play a
pivotal role in preserving and restoring
vital ecosystems by developing business
models and strategies that directly address
biodiversity.

For example, there are still limited investments
on sustainable fishery practices, nutrient
pollution reduction, and marine debris
pollution prevention. There is also a limited
number of business models in the Philippines
that incorporate ecosystem services and

biodiversity into their core strategies. In
addition, this limitation prevents large
investors from considering biodiversity as a
business opportunity. However, as the case
studies here exemplified, biodiversity efforts
receive a huge boost and scale up with private
sector support. Businesses, too, form better
relationships with stakeholders such as the
community, civil society, and government,
and even earn profits when they internalize
biodiversity into their business model.

Businesses can also address the seemingly
limited exchange of ideas between the
business sector and conservationists. By
creating channels of communication between
financiers, scientists, and nonprofit advocates,
private firms can enlarge the knowledge of
investors on biodiversity and inspire them
to channel fresh funds to explore business
opportunities in protecting our wealth of
wildlife.

BUILDING
FOUNDATIONS
for the FUTURE

Infrastructure or actual physical facilities, such as roads and houses, water and
sanitation networks, and power and telecommunication lines, are the building
blocks of our economies and societies.

Poor performance infrastructure thus directly affects competitiveness,
weakens delivery of education, health and other social services, and hampers
poverty alleviation.

Given the Philippines’ booming population and the challenges that come with
its archipelagic structure, proper distribution of infrastructure is a requisite
to addressing problems such as poverty and access to health and sanitation,
among other critical areas.

In order for the country to truly achieve sustainable development and lasting
prosperity, strategic infrastructure spending in both public and private spheres
must become the norm.

In recent years, the private sector has been able to fill in critical gaps in
public financing and management of infrastructure by actively supporting
public-private partnership business models. Such collaborations are crucial
to business success, given how aging and insufficient infrastructure hampers
businesses productivity and growth.

In this section, we review some notable private sector contributions to

Access to water and sanitation are not only
critical sustainable development challenges.
They are basic rights and are absolutely
necessary for any person to live with dignity.

But despite these fundamental principles
and the availability of water resources, crucial
gaps in water and sanitation services occur
in the Philippines. As a result, the country
has yet to achieve universal access to water
supply, sewerage and sanitation (WSSS)—a
prerequisite for achieving most of the targets
of the SDGs.

According to the results of the 2014 Annual
Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS), 3.29 million
families still rely on unsafe sources of water.
These sources include unprotected wells,
springs, and ponds, as well as unregulated
private services that peddle water by small
tanker trucks. 9 Meanwhile, 1.36 million
families in the Philippines still use the open pit,
drop or overhang, and pail system. 10 About 7
million Filipinos, as of 2015, continue to resort
to open defecation. 11

With the government and the private sector in
the lead, the country must resolve these issues
before the headways we have achieved in
various developmental fronts are threatened.
Increasing pressure on water quality and
availability as a result of climate change,
moreover, threaten to magnify and multiply
business risks in previously unforeseen ways.

Maynilad and Manila Water—two of the largest
and most successful water companies in the
Philippines—are concrete examples of how
business and development can come together
to address development gaps and result in
inclusive infrastructure investments.

Aside from investing in infrastructure and
engaging directly in water services, business
ventures can also fill in funding gaps for
water-related programs, as is the case for
the Development Bank of the Philippines’
financing scheme. We detail some of these
outstanding business examples, as well as
other longstanding gaps, in this subsection.

Private Sector Initiatives in addressing
ACCESS TO WATER AND SANITATION

IMPROVING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES

The water and sanitation sector in the
Philippines is decentralized, with local
government units having the authority to
determine how services are provided to
their constituents. According to 2009 NEDA
estimates, 25% of piped water services are
being provided by private companies.

As of 2016, Manila Water has reached
1.8 million people in its Manila concession

A bulk of these private-sector led services
are focused Metro Manila and other highly
urbanized centers. Two companies, Maynilad
and Manila Water, are able to directly address
the SDGs on water while remaining profitable
for its shareholders.

These two companies have also has constantly
shown that it is possible to provide affordable
and reliable access to safe drinking water
to low-income communities. Their highly
inclusive business models specifically targets
groups at the base of the pyramid to bring in
financial sustainability while generating wide-
scale positive impacts on society.

Maynilad served 9.3 million people,
provided 5.50 million people
sanitation facilities and desludged
96,500 septic tanks

The company’s commitment to its mission
is proven by its recent investments in
infrastructure and other service needs. In 2016,
the company invested P463 billion in capital
expenditures.

These figures have gone a long way in positive
results and enhanced shareholder confidence.

Manila Water has reduced non-revenue water
(NRW) from 63% at the start of its business
in year 1997 to only 10.8% in 2016. As of end
2016, the company has also reached 6.62
million people, achieved 1,008,918 water
connections, provided 99% of its customers
with non-stop access to water, and helped

has treated 51.52 cubic meters of used water,
preventing 9,003 tonnes of organic pollution
from reaching water bodies. Notably, access
to water now costs 20 times lower for poor
communities, and the company’s successful
operations has resulted in the creation of
USD500,000 worth of new jobs.

Maynilad has also achieved outstanding
results, especially in the environmental front.
With its sustained focus on refurbishing
infrastructure in some of Metro Manila’s oldest
districts, the company has prevented 86.5
million kg of pollution such as suspended
solids and oil and grease the company has
treated 58 billion cubic meters of waste water
in 2016, preventing 86.5 million kg of organic
pollution, suspended solids, and oil and grease
from reaching the rivers and eventually into
the sea. As of the same posting period, the
company has also considerably upped its
coverage figures - it has produced 864 trillion
liters of water, served 9.3 million people,
covered the sanitation needs of 5.50 million
people, and desludged 96,500 septic tanks.
The company’s NRW is also down to 30% from
66% in 2007.

Innovative programs, such as Manila Water’s
Tubig para sa Barangay (TPSB), transform poor
communities who previously had no access
to water services into paying customers and
active partners of the company.

CSR PROGRAMS AT WORK

Beyond their core business strategies,
Manila Water and Maynilad pursue a host of
sustainability and corporate responsibility
programs that further enable both companies
to achieve market inclusivity, cut down illegal
connections, and ultimately reduce non-
revenue water losses.

Another innovative scheme is Manila Water’s
Lingap Program, which complements the

successful TPSB. This CSR program enlarges the
social and health benefits that the company
brings by installing drinking fountains and
wash areas, and providing sanitation facilities
in public schools, hospitals, orphanages,
markets, city jails, and churches. To date,
more than 380 institutions and over 1.5
million beneficiaries have benefited from this
program.

Maynilad also pursues a host of corporate
social responsibility programs that aims to
enrich the publics’ knowledge of water and
sanitation issues and improve community
hygiene, while reaching various business goals
such as water-use efficiency and improved
water quality.

For instance, Maynilad’s Daloy Dunong
Water Education Drive, equips numerous
communities with the knowledge needed to
prevent water-borne diseases and maintain
the availability, safety, and potability of
their water supply. As a result, the program

transforms beneficiaries into active

sanitation management.

With an investment of over P1 million, the
program has so far reached 10 communities
and 102 schools, taught 26,215 students, and
installed 300 drinking and washing stations in
Maynilad’s concession area. This investment is
expected to produce quantifiable results in the
long-term, as the knowledge acquired from
these schools are upheld and passed on to
more communities and families.

FILLING IN FUNDING GAPS

A regulatory and financing environment that
is supportive of smaller firms can greatly
enhance the provision of water services in
remote and poor areas. This is exactly why
the DBP, the country’s leading development
financing institution, is easing the difficulty of
fundraising large amounts of capital for smaller
players who wish to enter the water services
industry.

Through its Environmental Development
Project, the DBP provides loan and technical

In partnership with the Private Financing
Institution (PFI) and the Philippine Water
Revolving Fund (PWRF), the program has
opened doors to various funding options and
has allocated P6.368 billion in support of 21
clean water and sanitation (WATSAN) projects.

These projects have resulted in an additional
yield capacity of 583,387 cubic meters per
day; an increase in water production of 210
million cubic meters per year; an added 3,000
cubic meters per day of sewerage treatment
capacity; and 273,929 additional water
service connections, benefitting more than
a million people in some of our poorest and
geographically isolated communities.

Gaps and Opportunities

107

The prevailing gaps in the provision of
water and sanitation services in the country
are partly attributed to the fragmented
governance structure of the sector. There
is no apex body assigned to oversee
overall planning, programming, and policy
formulation based on sound data, which
results in uncoordinated initiatives and
inefficient provision of services, especially in
rural areas. 12

WSSS companies may look into strengthening
partnerships and engagement processes with
relevant government agencies, especially
in the areas related to the creation of an
apex body, strengthening of rules, and
implementing institutional reforms.

In addition, entrepreneurs who are interested
in entering the water services industry may
look into other key gaps, including the limited
supply and increasing demand for wastewater
treatment and sewerage facilities.

Beyond these gaps, a wealth of opportunities
can be pursued in provincial areas and
distant communities who still lack access to
proper services. Companies may participate
in strengthening the capacity of LGUs to
implement projects, as well as in harnessing
the country’s PPP framework 13 to enable the
private firms to effectively partner with LGUs
for WSSS provision.

Community leaders at the grassroots level
must also be empowered to facilitate water
distribution and proper sanitation services to
their immediate communities. New business
models catering to this highly localized
approach may prove to be simultaneously
socially relevant and lucrative given the right
approach.

Other possible business actions and solutions
include the use of the latest wastewater
treatment processes and the development
of new raw water sources via ecologically
sustainable solutions.

The Philippines faces two major energy
challenges. First is the continued lack of
access of poor and geographically isolated
communities to electricity. The second relates
to the ability of the power sector to generate
cleaner forms of energy as a sustainable
business venture.

As detailed in the Philippine Development
Plan 2017-2022, there are still critical gaps in
the access to electricity in remote and off-grid
areas. Only 20.36 million households have
access to a steady supply of energy. This means
a tenth of the total number of homes in the
country still lead their lives with limited to zero
access to electricity.

Generating sustainable or renewable energyis
another major goal the country must achieve.
Towards this end, the county passed the
Renewable Energy Act in 2008 and created the
National Renewable Energy Program in 2011
to guide the full implementation of the law.
Despite these notable efforts, only 7,013.9 MW
of renewable energy has been installed out of
the country’s estimated 14,499.8 MW potential.
This has energized some companies to strike
out in fresh directions to reach those who
are still unserved, while setting the stage for
the renewable energy as profitable business
model. In this subsection, we review some
inspiring and inventive business concepts
that light up the way toward universal access
to energy in a way that reduces the nation’s
greenhouse gas emissions.

Our total GHG emission from energy-related
activities reached 73.3 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2011 from its
2010 level of 72.8 MtCO2e. Higher fossil fuel
demand in power generation caused this slight
increase.

Meanwhile, the country’s GHG emission from
all sectors dropped, except for the power
sector, which accounts for 44.1 percent of
our total GHG emission and contributes the
largest amount of 32.3 MtCO2e to our overall
emissions total.14

Meanwhile, a study conducted by the
Renewable Energy Coalition reveals that the
Philippines has renewable energy potential
(see right).

These are encouraging figures for those
interested in investing in renewables, as
expanding its use leads to lower generation
costs, especially in the long term. In recent
years, regulations such as Net Metering,
Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), and
Green Energy Option are being established to
facilitate the transition to sustainable energy in

the country. Through Net Metering, owners of
solar panels up to 100 kW can not only satisfy
their own electricity demand, but supply to
the local electricity grid as well. RPS for its part
will set the minimum percentage of generation
from eligible renewable energy sources. Green
Energy Option, on the other hand, provides
consumers with the option to choose RE as
their source of energy.

Transitioning to a cleaner energy network
will require the participation of all sectors,
especially the private sector, which has
the expertise and the best insight on our
capabilities to invest in renewable energy
sources, build clean energy infrastructure, and
develop better technologies and practices. 15

By investing today in research and
development toward new technologies, the
private sector can become the center of lasting
energy and climate change solutions. Business
can also accelerate progress by committing to
sourcing 100% of operational electricity needs
from renewable sources or at least from cleaner
fossil fuel technology.

PIONEERS IN NATURAL GAS

First Gen Corporation’s Santa Rita and San
Lorenzo Power Plants are the country’s first
natural gas plants. As trailblazers in this field,
both plants have helped pioneer the gas
industry through securing gas off-take through
a Gas Supply and Purchase Agreement (GSPA)
with the Malampaya Consortium, which
manages the field under Service Contract
(SC 38). The plants have also been able to
enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
with leading electricity distribution company
Meralco, thereby making the generation of
energy from natural gas a profitable business
innovation in itself.

First Gen Corporation’s Santa Rita and
San Lorenzo Power Plants generated
11,117.3 QWh in 2016

Recent figures from the entire year of 2016
show inspiring results for these plants.
Combined, both plants have added 1,500 MW
of installed generation capacity, generating a
total of 11,140 million kWh of clean electricity
which provided more than 16% of Luzon’s
power needs.

Both plants have also operated with minimal
GHG Emissions in 2015, leading to a total of
around 6.6 to 6.9 M tonnes of CO2 avoided. This
correlates to around a 61% reduction in CO2
emmitted into the environment. Compared to
coal plants, Santa Rita and San Lorenzo also
operate with less SOx, NOx, and particulate
matter, emitting ash and sludge.

The plants’ revenues and net income remain
consistent, with San Lorenzo posting revenues
of USD 535,141,000 and a net income of USD
87,648,300, and Santa Rita posting revenues of
over USD 291,535,600 and a net income of USD
46,175,300 for 2016.

BIOFUEL DIVERSIFICATION

As part of their inclusive business model,
SEAOIL Philippines invested in the
development and creation of more renewable
energy sources starting in 2005.

The company sets itself apart from
competitors by exceeding the 5 percent
ethanol-gasoline blended requirement
of the law. Prior to the 2006 biofuels act,
the company had already developed its
E10 diesel, which reduces carbon dioxide
emissions and increases energy conservation
levels.

As the first company to produce biodiesel in
the Philippines, SEAOIL’s innovations have
opened pathways to sustainable energy by

making petroleum that is less harmful to the
environment available to a larger market.
From a business vantage point, the cost is
reduced as domestic production of renewable
energy which would have otherwise been
imported by the company at much higher
costs.

According to SEAOIL, “affordable and clean
energy have long been a struggle for many
developing countries like the Philippines.
As the consumption of electricity increases,
weak legislation, and monopolies have led
to environmentally unsafe outcomes. By
pursuing cost-effective alternatives to fossil
fuel production, projects like the biofuel
diversification of Seaoil Philippines are a
step towards sustainable energy for mass
consumption.”

BANKING ON TURBINE
TECHNOLOGY

The potential of renewable energy to become
a viable and lucrative venture is evident in
the commitment and trust First Gen places
on expanding its green portfolio, with gas
plants continuing to provide clean and reliable
support to renewable development.
Aside from its Santa Rita and San Lorenzo
plants, the company has recently invested a
total of approximately USD 750,000,000 in
the San Gabriel Power Plant and Avion Power
Plant, located in the First Gen Clean Energy
Complex in Batangas City. One of the things
that make these plants unique is their use
of new turbine technology that is poised to
further enhance the country’s green energy
landscape.

San Gabriel Power Plant avoided GHG
emissions of 3,054 Tons due to its technology

The Avion Power Plant is the first land-
based power plant in the Philippines to use
aeroderivative turbine engines. These turbines
are the reasons behind Avion’s ability to ramp
up and down as quickly as it does, making it
crucial to stabilizing the grid, supplying peak
demand, and providing a reliable support to
intermittent renewables. The plant started
operating in September 2016, and is expected
to contribute toward the clean energy goals
of the country with it fast start technology to
support the grid’s needs.

This technology is also known for producing
a reliable supply of electricity. Particularly
important during times of increased demand,
Avion is able to reach a full load in around
15 minutes, up to 50 times faster than a coal
plant. This helps prevent brownouts by quickly
reacting to the volatile needs of the grid.

Another First Gen power plant that introduces
technological innovations is San Gabriel, which
uses Siemen’s combined-cycle gas turbine,
also known as SCC6-8000H. This is designed
to have a combined-cycle efficiency rating of
approximately 60 percent, while also offering
operational flexibility. San Gabriel’s efficiency
means that it can produce the same amount of
output while requiring less fuel input. Because
of this technology, San Gabriel has been
branded as a “Flex Plant” by Siemens -- the first
to be branded so in the Philippines -- a label
that describes its flexibility to start and stop at
least once a day operating when the plant is
most needed. The technology can thus adjust
more capably to periods when the grid has
varying or volatile needs, making it suitable
for mid-merit operations, as operations are
optimized towards this portfolio.

San Gabriel started operating in November
2016 and already contributes 414MW of
clean energy to the grid. In fact, the new San
Gabriel technology avoided estimated energy
requirements of 67,918 GJ’s and avoiding GHG
emissions of 3,054 tons during San Gabriel’s
operations in 2016. As such, its efficiency
makes it able to provide the needed electricity
with even less tons of CO2 per MWh generated.

conventional and renewable power generating
assets. This translates to over $700 million in
equity committed in the power sector.

Beyond its stake in several coal-fired power
plants, the company continues to expand
its renewable energy portfolio by investing
in wind and solar farms. These include the
Northwind Power Development Corp., North
Luzon Renewables (NLR), and Monte Solar
Energy.

The Northwind and North Luzon wind farms
are both located in Ilocos Norte. Northwind
uses 26 units of wind turbines with a net
capacity of 52 MW, while NLR uses 27 units of
wind turbines with a net capacity of 81 MW.
Monte Solar in Negros Oriental, on the other
hand, uses 67,920 modules of solar panels.
Today, these plants continue to produce
encouraging results towards the country’s
renewable energy targets.

ENSURING ACCESS
TO ENERGY FOR ALL

In remote and underserved regions,
connection to the main power grid is often
unviable because of high costs and the low
incomes of most end users. In some areas of
Mindanao, per capita incomes can average

to less than P100 a day. In addition, high-
cost structures and poor reliability in off-grid
areas, characterize some state-owned power
ventures that are mandated to ensure access
for all.

MAKING MOBILE SOLUTIONS
MORE AFFORDABLE

Many are increasingly using their phones to
connect via social media applications as such
service is mostly given free to users by the
country’s two service providers. Yet despite
the widespread popularity of mobile phones,
these devices are still used primarily for text
messaging and making calls.

For a time, making a call remained expensive.
However, as of January 1, 2017, the

interconnection rate of Globe Telecoms and
PLDT voice services is no longer higher than
P2.50 per minute. Calls made within the same
network cost even less. Mobile-to-mobile and
landline-to-mobile voice calls used to cost P4
per minute while mobile-to-landline voice
calls used to cost P3 per minute. With Globe
alone having a smartphone penetration of
approximately 50% of subscriber base, about
half of whom pay for data, this rate reduction
will invite more people to get a mobile
subscription and make use of their phones for
accessing the internet.

BUILDING ADEQUATE
MOBILE INFRASTRUACTURE

In the Philippines, numerous users share a very
limited mobile bandwidth, affecting internet
experience of mobile data users. Compared
to its Asian neighbors like Vietnam which
has around 55,000 cell sites and China which
has a million, the Philippines needs to catch
up and construct more cell sites in order to
increase available bandwidth for its growing
population of connected users.

PLDT has over 140,000 kilometers of fiber
links, the most extensive fiber infrastructure
in the country, that’s built over and under the
rugged terrain of the country’s archipelago.
This infrastructure supports both the roll out of
fiber facilities and hybrid fiber technologies to
homes and enterprise all over the country, and
the operations of the mobile services of Smart
and Sun.

To serve its over 63 million mobile subscribers,
particularly to make internet services in the

country faster, more reliable, and affordable,
Smart Communications is expanding
and beefing up its LTE and 3G mobile
data networks. To date, Smart has already
completed these network improvements in
Metro Davao, Metro Cebu, Rizal, and some
parts of Metro Manila, where users have
reported much improved data coverage and
speeds.

Smart’s commitment is to bring these
improvements to the rest of the country,
and to make Smart LTE available in 95% of
Philippine municipalities, serving about 97%
of the population, by the end of 2018. Smart is
focused on LTE because LTE, an all-IP network,
delivers superior experience for users,
particularly for data.

Globe Telecom on the other hand has a total
of 32,846 base stations in 2016, with over
21,300 for 4G (including HSPA+, WiMax, and
LTE), supporting the service requirements
of its 65.17 million subscribers. For fixed

the internet is crucial to the success or failure
of enterprises, including small businesses. The
internet speed in the Philippines, however, is
still one of the world’s slowest and is severely

the opportunity to invest in new technologies
and facilities that can improve ICT
functionality and enhance interconnectivity.
Globe’s acquisition of Bayan, alongside various
network upgrade projects, has improved
3G/4G coverage. Smart and Nokia are laying
out the foundation of a 5G network, as LTE
subscribers are expected to grow to around
40% of total mobile subscriptions by 2018.

One of telecommunications companies’
biggest challenge is accelerating infrastructure
development, while convincing communities
to allow them to build cell sites in their
neighborhood, as communities often fear
unfavorable health impacts. It is important for the
community to know the public benefits on this
regard, and the companies should demonstrate
that it is safe to live near a cell site.

Meanwhile, the newly created Department of
Information and Communications Technology
(DICT) seeks to build submarine cable landing
stations, a government backbone for the
whole country, and a last mile access network
as part of plans to establish a Philippine
Integrated Infrastructure. Plans are also in
place for public-private collaboration to find
solutions on how to connect remote locations
to the rest of the country.

By the year 2050, more than half of humankind
or about 70% of the world’s population will
live in cities. Housing will therefore play a
massively substantial role in the future and
shape of cities. SDG 11 seeks to make cities and
human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient,
and sustainable. It likewise aims to upgrade
slums and ensure universal access to adequate,
safe, and affordable housing. These 2030
targets also include providing widespread
access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green
and public spaces, particularly for women
and children, older persons, and persons with
disabilities.

For the period 2017-2022, approximately
6.8M housing units will be needed.

DBP’s RRFP seeks to deliver an
additional 3,000 shelter units to the exiting
inventory and livelihood assistance to at least
2,000 households through microfinance.

In the Philippines, our population is projected
to grow to 142 million by the year 2045. A
huge share of this number will be people
living in the rapidly evolving cities across
the country. Urbanization is moving at such
a rapid rate as a result of high population
growth and the continued influx of migrants
from rural areas. These people will obviously
need adequate houses to live in, with access to
economic opportunities and basic services.

The total housing need of the country remains
enormous. For the period of 2017-2022,
approximately 6.80 million housing units
will be needed. As of December 2016, the
housing backlog stood at 2.02 million units.
This demand presents revenue opportunities
for businesses, particularly those involved in
socialized or economic housing as majority of
these units are housing for the poor or low-
income people.

Businesses play a critical role in the holistic
urban development of cities. They have
devised innovative approaches and systems
to address the gaps in jobs and livelihood,
capability building for community groups,
and basic services like water, electricity,
sanitation, and transportation. They have also
come up with alternative and inclusive finance
mechanisms for low-income housing. These
are gaps that are typically observed when
government relocates communities from inner
parts of the city to the outskirts.

Cities and local governments that are seeking
to realize their sustainability objectives can
benefit from engaging with businesses early
in the planning and strategy development
process. They can leverage the capability
of business to identify cost-effective
solutions to complex and crosscutting urban
sustainability challenges. Together, business
and government, along with civil society and
relevant stakeholders, can jointly analyze,
discuss, develop, and act on a common
agenda for urban reform and sustainable
development.

Private Sector Initiatives on
AFFORDABLE HOUSING

PROVIDING ACCESS
TO LOW-INCOME HOUSING

The unmet demand for housing units
represent the housing requirements of
low-income or poor families. Developers
and other companies have now started
projects geared to this market. Banks and
other institutions have also expanded access
to their financial products to the poor or to
people whose incomes are derived from the
informal economy.

The Residential Real Estate Financing
Program (RRFP) is the banner shelter
program of the Development Bank of the
Philippines. It makes use of innovative
microfinance programs, among others, to
provide employees and overseas workers
access to funds for housing. Among its
remarkable programs is the Homeowners
Association (HOA) Lending Modality, which
pioneered commercial lending for housing
to community associations in 2008, and
the NGO and Housing Cooperative Lending
Modality, which supports nonprofits and
housing cooperatives with a proven track
record in shelter delivery, community
organizing, and savings and credit programs.
It also actively supports public-private
partnerships for affordable housing. as
well as stand-alone private sector and local
government housing initiatives. So far, RRFP
has invested P13.69 billion as of June 2016
into 242 real estate projects nationwide,
which include land acquisition by local

government units, site development, and
construction. It seeks to deliver an additional
3,000 shelter units to the existing inventory
and livelihood assistance to at least 2,000
households through microfinance.

Another program that supports housing
microfinance that targets low-income families
is the Tahanan Ko Initiative of Republic
Cement Services. Done in partnership with
three microfinance institutions, namely Tulay
sa Pag-Unlad, Inc. (TSPI), Alay sa Kaunlaran,
Inc. (ASKI), and Negros Women for Tomorrow
Foundation (NWTF), the initiative equips
account officers of these three institutions
with marketing materials and presentation
skills to better sell housing loans to qualified
members. It also ensures that projects are
done according to appropriate building and
sanitation standards using only high-quality
materials. This is why it has delivered better
designed and better built homes to 294,000
people.

In addition, the country now has more
private developers that are finding profitable
business solutions to addressing the housing
needs of the bottom of the pyramid. Bella
Vita by Ayala Land, Inc. targets low-income
households with monthly earnings of only
P10,000 to P25,000, or those who can afford
to pay P2,500 to P2,800 in amortization.
Lumina Homes by Vista Land and Landscapes
is another housing development that
provides socialized housing valued at not
more than P450,000 to mostly minimum
wage earners.

PROVIDING SHELTER
TO DISASTER-AFFECTED
AND DISPLACED FAMILIES

The Philippines ranks third globally in
combined disaster risk exposure and
vulnerability.

Recent extreme weather disturbances have
shown that those living near or along the
coastlines are most vulnerable to climate
change impacts and natural disasters.
Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), for example, left
550,928 families homeless in the islands of
Samar and Leyte, and partially damaged
589,404 more houses. In the wake of such
disasters, housing responses usually fall short
in meeting the high demand for immediate
shelter. The private sector has made several
initiatives to help address this need.

AES Philippines Power Foundation, in
partnership with Habitat for Humanity,
donated P5 million worth of disaster-resilient
houses to 25 families in Kawayanville,
Tacloban, who were affected by typhoon
Haiyan. Each house can withstand winds
similar to the strength of Haiyan or up to
250 km per hour. The houses, which were
funded by the monetary contributions of AES
employees globally, form part of a community
that also includes a day-care center, sports
facilities, and other amenities.

In Daanbantayan, Cebu, Republic Cement
Services worked with Habitat for Humanity,
too, to build affordable disaster-resilient
houses for 74 families displaced by typhoon
Haiyan. The housing units feature a hyperbolic
paraboloid (hypar) thin shell concrete roof
that can withstand wind speeds of up to 275
km per hour, a shotcrete wall system that
prevents water and chemicals from seeping,

and an anchor system that can hold a house
together against an intensity 8 earthquake.

Meanwhile, the Tabang sa Kabalayan (Homes
as Help) project of Holcim Philippines
provided housing to 100 families affected by
typhoon Pablo in 2012. Designed by Green
Architecture Advocacy of the Philippines,
the new village was built in accordance
with the company’s advocacy of sustainable
construction. The houses were made out
of hollow blocks and concrete roof tiles,
materials which the company pioneered
in New Bataan. Holcim also partnered
with the Technical Education and Skills
Development Authority (TESDA) in training
177 beneficiaries on skilled masonry. They
were also trained on carpentry, welding,
plumbing, and other construction-related
skills, enabling them to build their own
houses.

In Sara, Iloilo, Monsanto Philippines
collaborated with Gawad Kalinga and
invested P16.8 million to build 54 housing
units for farmers whose houses were
destroyed by Super Typhoon Yolanda and
Ruby. A total of 232 families were given new
shelters.

From 2010-2015, Sun Life of Canada
Philippines, together with an implementing
partner, helped build Legacy of Light Village
as resettlement for families displaced by the
rehabilitation of Pasig River. So far, 98 families
now live in 115 two-story housing units
inside a sustainable and green community
with its own gym and learning center. The

Gaps and Opportunities

Cities serve as centers for economic
development, commerce, science, culture, and
human development. With more and more
people now living in cities, more innovative
approaches to affordable housing are
needed for the millions of poor people that
continue to live in slums and other informal
settlements. The private sector may also
look into investing in housing microfinance
that cater to people with limited economic
opportunities.

Acquiring an adequate and decent house
should not be a burden and so government
must take steps to enable the private sector
to invest in low-income housing. The housing
bureaucracy also needs to rationalize and
urgently come up with measures related to
post-disaster shelter and targeted housing
subsidies for the people with disabilities,
the elderly, indigenous people, women, and
children.

Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Report 2016-2017, out of 138 countries
surveyed, the country ranked 106 for quality of
roads, 89 for quality of railroad infrastructure,
113 for quality of port infrastructure, 116
for quality of air transport infrastructure,
and 112 for quality of overall infrastructure.
Meanwhile, urban population is increasing at
a significant rate year after year, outpacing any
improvement made in the industry.

Transportation accounts for 36% of
total carbon dioxide emissions from fuel
combustion. A JICA report states that
greenhouse gas emissions are expected to
increase to 5.72 million tons a year in 2030,
compared to 4.7 million tons a year in 2012.
More cars on the road mean more greenhouse
gas emissions.

SDG 9 seeks to develop quality, reliable,
sustainable, and resilient infrastructure,
including regional and trans-border
infrastructure, to support economic
development and human well-being, with a
focus on affordable and equitable access for
all. At the same time, SDG 11, which is focused
on making cities inclusive, safe, resilient,
and sustainable, seeks to provide access to
safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable
transport systems for all by improving road
safety and expanding public transport.

Businesses play a crucial role in realizing these
sustainability goals. They have invested in
providing affordable public transport with
good intermodal connectivity not just in well-
developed cities but in rural areas and low-
income urban neighborhoods as well. They
have collaborated with local governments to
figure out future-ready mobility solutions and
infrastructure, from lighting to transportation
monitoring systems, which provide everyone
with access to a range of resource-efficient,
safe, and affordable transport options while
minimizing impact to the environment.

The transportation industry is an important
contributor to employment and national
development. According to the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
the country’s productivity loss amounts to
P2.6 billion per day due to the worsening
traffic situation in Metro Manila alone. If left
unchecked, the country will lose P6 billion per
day by 2030. This amount does not include
fuel wastages, other vehicle costs, and health
costs, among other losses.

In the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Report 2016-2017, the
Philippines ranked 112 out of 138 countries
for quality of overall infrastructure

The efficient mobility of people, goods, and
materials is clearly vital to the country’s
social and economic development. Workers
need to reach their offices in time for work.
Goods need to reach their destinations in the
shortest amount of time possible to enable
profitable flow of trade, commerce, and
finance.

Sustainable transportation requires
lowering travel distances and reducing
traffic congestion as much as possible.
More importantly, it also seeks to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution,
and health and safety risks arising from
transportation. By doing so, people will spend
less on transportation and other related
expenses, waste less time moving from one
place to another, and have more time instead
for physical activity and social interaction.

In the Philippines, achieving sustainable
transport will require a lot of work not
just from the government but also from
the private sector. According to the World

Private Sector Initiatives on
EFFICIENT MOBILITY

MODERNIZING
URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT

City commuters need mass transit options
that will not only decongest the city of cars,
but also provide the riding public with better
and more convenient mobility solutions.
While public utility jeepneys (PUJs) provide
livelihood to numerous people, buses and
trains that move a larger number of people
should be made more widely available.
Demand for mass transits in Metro Manila
alone is expected to reach 7.4 million
passengers per day by 2030.

P2P buses cut travel time by 20-30 minutes
as buses do not make any stops along their
routes and depart according to fixed schedule

Express or point-to-point (P2P) buses are
now available in select parts of Metro Manila,
providing commuters with a faster way to
travel. P2P Premium Bus Service cuts travel
time for those passing through EDSA by 20-
30 minutes as buses do not make any stops
along its route and depart according to a fixed
schedule, not on whether the bus is full or not.
The ride costs P20 more than ordinary city
buses but riders attest that the convenience
offered by P2P is worth the higher price tag.
P2P, an initiative of the DOTC, LTFRB, and
MMDA, together with Froelich Tours, RRCG
Transport, and HM Transport, has successfully
attracted a number of car users to shift to
public transport.

Bonifacio Global City (BGC) Bus Transit System,
meanwhile, ferries office workers and other
people from a fixed terminal in Makati, which
is along EDSA and near the MRT, to seven

different points inside the new business
district. Buses also depart according to a fixed
schedule, ensuring that passengers arrive at
their destinations on time.

At the Ninoy Aquino International Airport,
Air21 and the Department of Transportation
run UBE Express, a premium airport shuttle
service that directly brings passengers
to the Makati CBD, Roxas Boulevard, or
Entertainment City. All of these buses are
brand new Mercedes Benz MCV 120 units,
which are designed to lower emissions and
have speed limiters or sensors that prevent
the buses from moving when their doors are
open. This new fleet also showcase low entry
doors and ramps to make them accessible to
people in wheelchairs.

Global Electric Transport (GET) has been
operating a fleet of zero emission, fully electric
vehicles called the City Optimized Managed
Electric Transport (COMET) in Quezon City
since 2014. COMET is a 20-passenger vehicle
that uses lithium ion batteries. It can travel
up to 80 km on a full charge, with speeds
capped at 60 kph. Fares are collected using
stored-value cards, providing passengers
the convenience of easily tapping in and out
along Mindanao Avenue, Congressional Road,
Luzon Avenue, and Katipunan Road. GET will
be rolling an all new fleet of airconditioned
COMETs in the last quarter of 2017 that feature
lithium titanate batteries that can be fully
charged in 20 minutes and couple this with a
QR code based mobile app ticketing and fare
collection system for better passenger service.

Finally, Bemac Electric Transportation
Philippines Inc. recently bagged a $30-million
deal to produce 3,000 units of electric
tricycles (e-trikes) under the joint project
of the Department of Energy and Asian
Development Bank. Shell Philippines for
its part is doing the Shell Eco Marathon to
challenge students to design ultra-energy-
efficient vehicles.

INVESTING IN ADVANCED
TRANSPORT SYSTEMS

With the advent of big data and modern
ICT technologies come intelligent systems
that speed up processes related to the
transportation industry. In use now, for
example, are innovative solutions, which
automate collecting fare and other payments
for the convenience of the riding public.

Beep is a reloadable contactless smart card
designed to replace the magnetic card
system used in Metro Manila’s three rapid
rail lines (LRT1, LRT2, and MRT3). Developed
and operated by AF Payments Inc., a joint
venture of Ayala Corporation and Metro Pacific
Investments Corporation (MPIC), Beep seeks
to unify these rail lines through an Automated
Fare Collection System. Further, the Beep

stored-value card aims to reduce time spent
queuing to buy tickets and to streamline train
line transfers.
At the Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX), South
Luzon Expressway (SLEX), and the Skyway,
riders use Radio Frequency Identification
(RFID) sticker tags to make cash-less and
queue-less payments at toll stations. CAVITEX’s
EasyDrive and the Auto Sweep RFID for
SLEX and the Skyway use a sticker affixed to
the front of a vehicle so that motorists pass
through dedicated toll lanes with ease.

Meanwhile, at the North Luzon Expressway
(NLEX), Easytrip Tag provides an interoperable
service for the electronic payment of toll
fees both in NLEX and Subic-Clark-Tarlac
Expressway (SCTEX) and other merchants.
Easytrip comes with a tap card that can be
used to pay for merchant services on the road,
such as restaurants, car parks, and gasoline
stations using the same Easytrip Account.

IMPROVING ROADS AND OTHER
TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE

Good quality roads are a must for effective
transportation. Metro Manila, for example,
only has 1 km of road per 424 vehicles, which
explains traffic congestion in high-density
corridors. However, roads and other related
infrastructure must be balanced to meet
the needs not just of trucks and private car
owners, but also of the public, particularly
mass transit passengers, bikers, and
pedestrians.

from major hubs. For example, transit stops
and public utility vehicle terminals serve an
average of 10,500 daily commuters in its Cebu
Holdings Inc. (CHI) estates.

Meanwhile, Manila North Tollways Corp.
(MNTC) is building additional lanes in three
major toll plazas along NLEX in order to
speed up toll gate transactions in high-traffic
exits. Similar initiatives are being undertaken
through Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).
These allow the private sector to finance the
construction, operation, and maintenance of
major infrastructure projects.

Ayala Land has also invested in developing
integrated public transport terminals in all
of its projects. All of its properties, including
its malls, are at most two to three rides away

Some completed PPP projects include the
Daang-Hari-SLEX Link Road, the Mactan-
Cebu International Airport, and the NAIA
Expressway Project (Phase II).

NON-MOTORIZED INITIATIVES

Business initiatives are less likely to be found
in the transportation industry. Yet this is an
industry that is profitable and has huge public
impact. For example, there are economic
opportunities that can be made in investing in
non-motorized transport infrastructure such
as walkways, safe footpaths, and bike paths.
From a sustainable standpoint, such initiatives
can reduce air and noise emissions, minimize
greenhouse gas emissions, improve human
health, create conditions for higher quality of
life, and cultivate social equity.

As such, Ayala Land is putting pedestrians
first in its estates, which is why all of its
developments are fully interconnected, easy
to navigate, and provide enough secured
pathways for people to walk free from
road-related harm or danger. Vermosa, a
700-hectare estate in Cavite with 60 hectares
dedicated to public use, has a 14 km greenway
and main roads with wide pedestrian lanes
and 1.5-meter-wide bike lanes. Arca South has
dedicated bike lanes and wide walkways, too,
plus an integrated parking system. Recently
acknowledged as the longest walkway in
the Philippines, the Dela Rosa Elevated
Walkway in Makati is a pedestrian bridge that
directly connects to office buildings, retail
establishments, shopping malls, and other key
stops along the city’s main business corridor.

Gaps and Opportunities

Expanding access to affordable means of public transport with good intermodal connectivity
and to a steady movement of goods and services will open up new market opportunities. These
expansions can be coupled with innovations like bus rapid transport, automated fare collection,
intelligent systems for traffic control, ride sharing and other on-demand services, and pooled
freighting to facilitate cost-effective movement of goods.

Companies can also choose to anticipate future demand and initiate the production of vehicles
and technologies that have low impact on the environment. This includes the development of
next generation biofuels or creating modes of transport powered by renewable energy. Low-
cost durable vehicles such as bamboo bicycles are suitable for use by people living in areas with
poor rural roads.

Public education is one of the biggest challenges in the transportation industry. Stakeholders
in the transportation industry should be encouraged to participate in developing solutions that
promote the use of more sustainable modes of transportation.

TOWARD
EXCELLENCE

in CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Good corporate governance is a hallmark of an accountable, responsive, and
transparent organization. According to the U.N. Global Compact: Guide to
Corporate Sustainability, good governance does not only bring prosperity to
shareholders, it also promotes financial, environmental, and ethical growth for
more people in and outside the private sector.

Good governance also has the power to make companies more participatory
and equitable, and thus also more effective and efficient. In the Philippines,
the onus of formulating governance guidelines and monitoring corporate
compliance falls on the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Philippine Stock Exchange.

Philippine companies that wish to pursue stronger governance initiatives may
look into the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (ACGS) and the Integrity
Initiative for initial reference and advice. The ACGS, introduced in 2011 by the
ASEAN Capital Markets Forum and the Asian Development Bank, is one of
the leading indicators of good corporate governance among publicly listed
companies in ASEAN states. The Integrity Initiative, meanwhile, is a network of
various companies that advocate good governance, transparency, and strong
integrity measures in the Philippines.

In recent reports, both organizations reveal that an increasing number
of Philippine companies are now aiming to increase their standards of
governance. The ACGS noted 50 Filipino companies as among the region’s top-
performing in 2014. In addition, more than 3,500 organizations in the country
have signed the Integrity Initiative Pledge—a formal statement vowing to
abide by ethical business practices and support a national campaign against
corruption.

In this final section, we quickly survey some examples of outstanding good
corporate governance practices, particularly with regard to inclusive decision
making, accountability, transparency, ethical behavior, and corruption.

The presence of more women and
independent directors in the boardroom is
one indicator of a healthy governance system
in a company.

But out of the 24 companies surveyed that
disclosed their ACGS, only 17 had a female
member of the board, translating to one
female board member for every 10 board
members. Deloitte, meanwhile, found that
women held only 7.4% of board seats in
the Philippines in 2015. A study by Dumlao
in 2014, however, found that boards in the
country are comprised of 6.53 directors on
average, two of whom are female. This places
the local proportion of women directors at
31 percent, higher than the global average of
27%.

While these mixed results already appear
promising, more must be done to promote
female leaders in the corporate world. A
study from MSCI ESG Research, Inc. revealed

that companies that had strong female
leadership generated a Return on Equity of
10.1% per year versus 7.4% for those without
(on an equal-weighted basis). Companies
lacking board diversity tend to suffer more
governance-related controversies than
average. Also, according to the Credit
Suisse Research Institute’s biannual report
“The CS Gender 3000,” companies that have
at least three women on the board have
three times higher market capitalization
compared to those who only have one
female representative. Yet in a recent survey
conducted by KPMG R.G. Manabat & Co.
among the top 1,000 corporations, very
few were led by women. “Of the top 1,000,
we contacted 770 and only 68 are led by
women. Clearly there is a need for more. This
was a disturbing statistic that drove us to
pursue our advocacy for the advancement of
women,” noted KPMG Vice Chairman and FCC
Founding Member Sharon Dayoan.

and around 20 percent have at least one

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

Alongside the presence of more female leaders, having independent board members is another
key factor to ensure inclusive governance processes. The presence of more independent
board members reduces conflicts of interest among a company’s top advisors. Out of the 24
companies that disclosed their ACGS, 11 companies had a good proportion of independent
directors in their boards, or around 50% of their board membership.

ACCOUNTABILITY
AND TRANSPARENCY

Companies that are truly accountable and
transparent are able to provide the necessary
information that engages stakeholders to
make informed decisions and participate in
key decision-making processes.

Having a separate CEO and Chair of the
Board is now widely acknowledged as a
good governance practice as it strengthens
the objectivity of the board and promotes
its ability to think independently from
management. This in turn brings about
greater accountability and transparency,
as vital decisions are not held by a
homogeneous few.

A review of recent ACGRs reveal that having
a separate CEO and Chair of the Board is a
growing trend, with 18 out of 24 companies
following this route. In addition, proper
auditing practices and mandatory guidelines
to promote integrity and transparency in
Related Party Transactions are being upheld
among this group.

ETHICAL AND LAWFUL BEHAVIOR

The ability to uphold ethical standards among
companies is a precondition to an inclusive
and equitable corporate landscape. As noted
in the Principles of Corporate Governance
of the OECD, a popular global benchmark
since 1999, high ethical standards should be
applied by a company’s board, taking into
account the interest of stakeholders.

Living up to this ideal, many local companies
are developing and disclosing their respective
Codes of Ethics, while creating measures to
encourage the reporting of unethical behavior
among their ranks.

Globe Telecom expresses its commitment
to proper business conduct through its
Employee Handbook on Code of Conduct and

Ethics. This manual, detailing various policies
on ethics, covers all regular employees,
officers, and directors of Globe and its
subsidiaries. Project hires, consultants, and
other personnel that are not considered as
regular employees, are also tasked to follow
the code.

For its part, Energy Development Corporation
communicates its activities pertaining to
ethics in its Corporate Governance Report,
annual disclosures and reports, and the
company’s Form 17-A, which it submits to the
SEC.

Aboitiz, meanwhile, has a Code of Ethics
and Business Conduct which has been in
place since 2002. This code applies to all
regular employees and summarizes Aboitiz’s
fundamental policies and directives on
abiding by ethical standards.

TRANSFORMATIONAL BUSINESS

BATTLING CORRUPTION
AND UNETHICAL PRACTICES

The ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard
considers bribery, fraud, extortion and money
laundering, as well as collusion and conflict of
interest, as corrupt practices and detrimental
to longstanding corporate growth. As such,
the scorecard places a high premium on
corporate policies pertaining to fighting
corruption and whistle-blowing.

Based on recent surveys, the solicitation of
bribes from private companies appear to be
dropping steadily. The SWS Enterprise Survey
on Corruption reached a record low in 2013
when only 44 percent of business people
surveyed said that they were actually asked
to participate in bribery. While still high,
this figure already marked a considerable
improvement from 2012’s 50 percent and
2009’s 60 percent.

Further, a study by Ernst and Young showed
that 72 percent of Filipino employees say
their respective organizations would support
whistle-blowers. About 37 percent of those
surveyed also indicated their reluctance to
use a whistle-blowing hotline, saying they are
concerned over its confidentiality and ability
to fully protect them legally.

In JG Summit Holdings, employees are
encouraged to communicate any knowledge
of illicit activities through the reporting
channels of its Conflict of Interest Committee.
The company has policies that cover business
conduct, whistle-blowing, and conflict of
interest, among other areas. New employees
are oriented on these policies and are
given periodic reminders to abide by these
guidelines.

Energy Development Corporation strictly
prohibits unethical and corrupt practices.
According to the company, “management
is primarily responsible in overseeing the
efficiency of its anti-corruption programs,
which go beyond detection and prevention
of fraud and other corrupt practices.” The
company’s whistle-blower policy, called the
Protected Disclosure Policy, enables not
only employees and shareholders, but also
customers and the public at large, to report
issues involving illegal and questionable
activities or omissions, unethical behavior,
fraud and other malpractices.

Globe, meanwhile, defines its procedures for
acting on illegal and unethical behavior in its
Code of Conduct and Ethics. The company’s
whistle-blowing channels are easily accessible
to any person using the hotline number and
email address.

FOSTERING
A CULTURE OF INTEGRITY

In signing the Integrity Pledge, companies
formally express their commitment to abide
by ethical business practices and support a
national campaign against corruption. They are
also urged to take an integrity self-test not only
to reveal areas of corruption that they are most
susceptible to, but also to create measures that
directly address these vulnerabilities.

Since 2010, more than 3,500 parties, including
government agencies, have already signed
the Integrity Pledge. This figure, however, only
represents a small fraction of the estimated
670,000 groups registered with the SEC , as well
as the over 40,000 local government units in the
country.

There is a need to promote greater private
sector participation in networks like the Integrity

Initiative, as the highest levels of integrity are key
to a truly sustainable society and environment.
This need becomes more crucial given the
continued perception and actual reports of
corrupt practices in the government.

To address this systemic problem, the Integrity
Initiative believes curbing poverty must be
done in both the public and private sectors
simultaneously. According to the group, doing
so would help regain public trust in both parties
and propel the country to greater economic
growth. They likewise urge corporate leaders
to lead by example and clearly communicate
policies against bribery and other illicit activities.

According to the American Chamber of
Commerce’s Integrity Handbook, four of the
best examples of outstanding integrity practices
in the Philippines are those managed by the
Manila Electric Company (Meralco), Manila Water,
SEAOIL, and Punongbayan & Araullo.

TRANSFORMATIONAL BUSINESS
143

DEMANDING INTEGRITY,
DIVERSITY, AND
TRANSPARENCY OF LEADERSHIP

Good governance practices attract the
right people, enlarge foreign investments,
and ultimately lead to a more sustainable
company. As such, stakeholders must demand
the highest levels of good governance from
their top executives and board members.

While the foundations for strong governance
measures are already in place in the Philippine
private sector, a good deal of work remains to
be done, particularly when dealing with the
government, to fill in gaps that threaten to
undermine advances already made.

In terms of corruption, for example, many
Philippine companies still do not have a
categorical policy on dishonest and fraudulent
conduct involving money or bribery. The
Integrity Initiative also found that there is
“no consensus on the range of acceptable
practices in giving gifts and other tokens
of hospitality” to government officials.
These grey areas most likely affect smaller
companies that do not have the mettle or
clout to fight bribery in both public and
private spheres.

In terms of transparency, companies
should be mandated to reveal the scores or

findings of the ACGS and Integrity Initiative
on their respective websites and reports.
This will greatly help investors and internal
stakeholders in assessing a company’s level
of maturity in terms of governance. It can also
motivate corporate leaders to become more
conscientious and accountable in dealing with
the government or managing their supply
chains.

Given these gaps, new linkages between
the private sector and the government can
be formed to further fight bribery and other
forms of corruption that have already become
systemic in many organizational cultures.

Other measures that are ripe for development
include the creation of national integrity
summits or awards that will push more
companies to join integrity and transparency
networks. The evaluation committee of
SEC should likewise be strengthened to
ensure that companies with strong integrity
measures are properly recognized. Further, the
SEC should encourage companies to disclose
their ASEAN Corporate Governance Scores for
the easy access of investors and the business
media.

Finally, diversity in boardrooms and at the top
levels of management should be encouraged
to develop a corporate landscape that is
inclusive and truly speaks on behalf of the
needs of all stakeholder groups.

The Road to 2030

Despite rapid economic growth across the globe, persistent development problems continue to
negatively impact millions of lives.

Social exclusion and inequities. The threat of climate change. Lack of access to public services
and infrastructure. Environmental degradation. These are just some of the enduring challenges
that the Sustainable Development Goals aim to finally resolve by 2030.

Given the comprehensive nature of the SDGs and the massive scale of their ambition, the private
sector’s contribution has become indispensable to our collective cause. According to the U.N.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, we need to activate business as never before: “We are spreading
the word far and wide that every business has a responsibility to improve our world.”

WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN DO

Integrate the SDGs into business. Companies must now recognize the need to incorporate the
SDGs into their core business strategies. This will entail developing new business concepts and
transforming philanthropic and CSR programs into actual business models that deliver value both
for society and the company.

Collaborate. An openness to collaboration and a strong spirit of inclusion have become essential
for doing good business today. Companies can reach a wider market base and achieve value at
scale by partnering with other companies, as well as the government and civil society groups.

Prioritize under-served areas. In partnership with the government, companies can significantly
address regional disparities and inequities through target-based solutions that also bring in
profit for shareholders. This could be achieved by re-allocating resources to under-served
municipalities and growing them into stronger markets, thereby enabling them to deliver
substantial returns on investment later on. This could also unclog urban centers and allow the
smoother and equitable flow of wealth into other locales.

Invest in monitoring and reporting. Several internationally accepted sustainability reporting
frameworks are now in place to guide companies in aligning their key business strategies with
developmental goals. These include the UN Global Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative,
among other frameworks.

Embed the SDGs across the value chain. Businesses should also integrate the SDGs not only within
their operations, but also across their entire value chains. By doing so, the private sector can spread
its influence from upstream suppliers and industries down to consumers and end-users.

WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO

Engage the private sector. It is critical to engage the private sector in development planning and
implementation. Although local government units and other state agencies are at the forefront
of services delivery, establishing synergies with the private sector could introduce efficiencies
and innovations, and enlarge the impact of public services.

Encourage private sector participation. To inspire more companies to help in development, the
government can create an enabling environment through fiscal measures, regulatory policies,
and legislative changes. Only 42% of businesses, for instance, engage with policy-makers. While
the need for businesses to focus on their customers and the bottom-line are obvious priorities, it
is also critical that policies are developed with input from businesses.

WAY FORWARD

The United Nations Development Programme and the Philippine Business for the Environment
are implementing the SDGs is Our Biz project.

Complementing the SDGs Portal and this annual publication, SDGs is Our Biz will be a landmark effort
to guide enterprises in integrating the Global Goals into their business models and CSR initiatives.

The project will create ways for the private sector and the government to follow evidence-based
decision-making processes, share best practices, and create knowledge among companies,
the government, and other key stakeholder groups. It also seeks to standardize SDGs reporting
across the entire private sector.

Please contact UNDP or PBE to know more about the project and what we can do to get you
started on your journey towards heightened entrepreneurship and sustainable development.

Annex 1

The United Nations Development Programme, in partnership with the Philippine Business for the
Environment, launched the SDGs online portal on 8 September 2016.

The SDG online portal (http://sdgreport.thepbe.org), is an online platform where companies
provided data and other information on their initiatives that contribute to the SDGs. A list of
business initiatives contributing to the SDGs and pre-filled form was made accessible and
downloadable for the reference of companies submitting their initiatives.

Companies were requested to fill-up the Project Information Form which includes questions on
project overview, key results and impacts, and other project details.

Based on the submissions, the criteria for inclusion in the report are as follows:

• Completeness of data
• Alignment of the initiative with the SDG targets
• Scale of resulting output of reported initiative which contributes largely to society
• Innovative approaches identified

It is worth noting that the investments data in this report are based on disclosed investments
submitted in the SDG online portal and varies in terms of timelines. The investments data provided
were aggregated to capture (1) the total amount of the reported investments and (2) the total
amount of disclosed investments per primary SDG which the initiative targeted. However, please
note that these amounts do not encapsulate the entirety of the investments of the reported
initiatives and the contributions of the private sector.
