> Title of the innovation

An environment for all generations to come

> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation is based on waste management that can help reduce climate change and protect our environment from harmful effects of poor waste management this can preserve many living creatures and save them from going into extinct and keep our environment green easily.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate money by collection of solid and biodegradable waste which will later be recycled. Solid waste such such a as glass bottles will be transferred into building quarry dust which will sold and biodegradable waste to bio and fertilizers which will be sold to the locals.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is designed in a way that will enable us collect waste from homes and industries and other business places. The waste collected will later be separated and processed into useful forms that will be packaged and ready for the market.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will improve the lives of many both our team mates and residents of our town. It will be able to generate income for our team mates that will improve the quality of our lives to grow into something big, aside that our environment will be waste free meaning we would have dealt with pollution. If our environment is waste free it means we can increase the number of people having access to clean water and non polluted lands. We can as well reduce climate change and have a green environment that will benefit the living creatures and human beings as well.
