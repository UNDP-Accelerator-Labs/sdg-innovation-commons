> Title of the innovation

e-Tandizo

> Brief description of the innovation

Drawing on the fact that students, especially in learning institutions face similar challenges. The goal is to provide an online platform for them to be able to converse and share knowledge with one another. This would help lessen the learning curve experienced by most students and allow them to have access to a wider pool of knowledge.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The primary target market for the business is students. As they well be the primary uses of the platform. There are three ways in which the traffic on the site will be monetized:

1. Digital ads, given the fact that the traffic will be consistent. This can be used to draw in sponsors for the app as well as the use of services that pay for ad space such as Google and Amazon ads. Universities and other learning institutions might wish to advertise their services on the platform as well. 

2. Premium services. While joining the platform and conversing with its members will be free. There will be special features that will be available only to premium paying users such as access to tutors and advise from specialists within your field of study.

3. Publications. The platform shall also allow students to publish useful articles for peer review at a fee. These articles will however need to be reviewed by experts within that field to ensure their accuracy and applicability. 

The secondary target market would be tutors. Individuals who seeks to be registered as tutors on the platform would be required to pay a monthly fee.

The money from the challenge would be used to hire a good team of developers as well as help market the platform effectively to students across the country.

> Technical Feasibility

The platform shall start off as a mobile app that users will be able to freely install on their mobile devices. Then will later expand to desktop versions and a web application. The goal is to eventually spread out to other countries on the continent.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Having been a student myself, I can say for a fact that some of the best help you can receive is from seniors, and fellow students. Covid 19 has shown us that relying on traditional means isn't always helpful. Right now students are struggling to find the information and help they need to participate effectively in school and understand their materials. Such a platform would be very useful for such eventualities. Further times are changing and most social interactions take place online, as such a platform like this would do greatly to help connect students with the help they need to succeed in their educational endeavors.
