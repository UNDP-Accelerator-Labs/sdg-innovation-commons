## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity aims to teach participants how to use environmental data (air, water, and waste) to develop innovative, data-driven solutions that inform public policies and increase environmental awareness. The goal is to improve participants' skills in data analysis, visualization, and collaborative problem-solving.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is important because it empowers citizens and experts to directly contribute to sustainability efforts by analyzing real-world data, fostering civic engagement, and generating actionable insights for better environmental governance

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF participants analyze environmental data (air, water, and waste) and collaborate to create data-driven solutions, THEN they will generate innovative products that raise public awareness and inform better environmental policies, leading to improved sustainability efforts in La Paz.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Data Analysis and Collaboration:

Participants from multidisciplinary teams will analyze environmental data (air quality, water resources, and waste) provided by the Municipal Secretariat of Environmental Management in La Paz.
Workshops and Training:

Conduct workshops and expert talks to equip participants with the tools needed for data analysis and innovation.
Location and Timeline:

The event will take place at Universidad Católica Boliviana on November 11-12, 2023.
Project Development:

Teams will create data-driven products (dashboards, infographics, maps) and present their solutions, which will be evaluated for policy impact​
