> Title of the innovation

Plastic Bank

> Brief description of the innovation

A sustainable system aimed at collecting recyclable plastic waste from urban areas, water bodies and rural areas.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The selling of recyclable plastic waste to processing companies for heating and transforming the plastic waste into usable goods to re-enter the public market.
This business will allow the employment of various members of society by involving them in the collection of plastic waste and processing to ensure a constant input of recyclable plastic to be sold to manufacturing companies.
The prize money, hopefully once received, will act as the first working capital of the company to purchase equipment and marketing allowing the company to grow and build upon. One of the first requirements that could be met by the prize money is the purchasing of land to act as a full scale Plastic Bank.

> Technical Feasibility

It's designed to involve a range of people from collectors to processing stuff and to marketing directors.
The collector will locate and collect wastes from city streets and place them into containers that are light enough to carry and transport this waste to the Plastic Bank. 
Once at the Plastic Bank a team of stuff will sort the plastic according to researched data on their contents from manufacturers to ensure it can either be easily processed by recycling units or not.
Once the plastic has been processed, it will be stacked in accordance to it's recyclable qualities and marketed to be sold and reused to become a new product.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This proposed system can provide raw materials required locally for the production of various products that require plastic as a form of storage or utilise the qualities shown by plastic.
It has the potential of addressing current poverty issues my country is facing by adding members of society to the workforce as collectors or processing personnelle.
This system also has the potential to clean up major cities and urban areas that have no proper means of waste disposal. 
The system can cause a huge impact on the environment by relieving water bodies of their plastic burden. Water bodies such as the Solwezi River have been considered to be highly polluted due to their waste content as test of shown.
