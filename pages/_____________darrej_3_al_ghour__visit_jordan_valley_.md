A community project that aims to empower the local farmers by providing a unique, authentic, life-changing experience in the Jordan Valley.  A start-up aiming to introduce many agritourism, eco-friendly, fun, non-touristic, and socially responsible experiences to those who live in concrete forests and search for a different meaning to life in Jordan Valley (from Irbid to Karak). I travel, explore, camp, and walk solo or with travel partners to see the countries through the stories of the locals. My curiosity takes me far away from my travel plan. Usually, these unplanned adventures end up being the best part of the trip. I believe that living the experiance of alternative traveling is probably the most natural way to learn and know things.
