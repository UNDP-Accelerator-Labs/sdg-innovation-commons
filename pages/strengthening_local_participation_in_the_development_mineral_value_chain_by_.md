## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Strengthening Local Participation in the Development Mineral Value Chain by surfacing local innovations
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in the Development Minerals Sector most Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASM) rely on importing the equipment required for their operations and value addition.  As a result, this has led to barrier for entry and growth as most operations are subsistent and not viable leading to the adoption of poor mining practices which has ultimately led to many ASMs being stuck in a poverty trap. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Zambia’s development trajectory has been shaped mainly by mining, with the extraction of copper contributing to   70% of the country’s foreign exchange earnings and 14% of the GDP.  Without exception, the firms that have dominated the sector have been large-scale, mostly foreign with access to huge capital outlays and have focused on copper mining. Zambia is well endowed with a plethora of mineral deposits beyond copper, which have primarily been mined by Artisanal Small-Scale Miners (ASM). These principally include Development Minerals such as limestone, feldspar, salt, gypsum, granite, flat stones and clay gemstones – emerald, aquamarine, tourmaline and amethyst. The Development Minerals sector is mostly done on a small scale, locally driven, has low barriers to entry, and involves different types of minerals beyond copper. In contrast to the large-scale tradable minerals, the ASM sector and the Development Minerals sector in particular, have implications on sustainable development due to closer links with the local economy and have potential to generate more local jobs with greater impact on poverty reduction. The Development Minerals sector represents an important and growing part of the mining industry in Zambia that provides an opportunity to diversify away from over-dependence on one mineral commodity. Although the sector has the potential to depend on the locally produced equipment and tools which in turn could provide a sustainable domestic supply chain in the country’s construction and industrial sectors, most ASM rely on importing the equipment required for their operations and value addition.  As a result, this has led to barrier for entry and growth as most operations are subsistent and not viable leading to the adoption of poor mining practices which has ultimately led to many ASMs being stuck in a poverty trap.  Due to the lack of a proper mechanism in the sector for providing support to artisanal and small-scale miners, other challenges faced include lack of access to and inability to generate geological information; lack of technical and business know-how of the sector due to unavailability of capacity building opportunities; lack of information and access to market linkages including tax incentives; and lack of access to proper technology due to capital constraints.   Therefore, addressing the constraints affecting the extractive sector would benefit local business enterprises, mining companies, government and the economy as a whole. At local business level, it would give rise to increased demand for local input production and supply. This would increase access to local business growth opportunities, trigger market-led capability, upgrade and increased access to capital, productivity, technology, and improve health, safety and environmental management practices.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP has been working collaboratively with the Government of the Republic of Zambia, through the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development to provide opportunities for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining projects through the ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme. The ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme is capacity building program that aims to build the profile, and improve the management, of Development Minerals. The program is an initiative of the Organization of African, Caribbean and Pacific (OACP) Group of States, financed by the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and implemented by UNDP. The programme, currently under a second phase of implementation, aims to enable ASMEs in the Development Minerals sector to achieve better livelihoods through higher employment and incomes from their mining operations. One strategy to achieving these objectives is through implementation and scale-up of inclusive business models in the Development Minerals sector in Zambia. Through the UNDP Accelerator lab, the project intends to expand the scope of this support to include supporting local innovators to participate in the Development Minerals Value Chain. Leveraging government’s deliberate focus on MSMEs and on innovation, there is potential to grow, explore and surface solutions that may already be on the ground. Harnessing the collective industrial capabilities of local innovators by supporting research and development will be key to supporting the sustained growth of the mining sector.
