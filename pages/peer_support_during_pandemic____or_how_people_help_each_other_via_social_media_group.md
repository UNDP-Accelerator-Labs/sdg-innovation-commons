Problem Statement: 


Due to the drastic increase in Covid19 cases Georgian government and medical sector failed to provide adequate services for all who are in need, the 112 emergency services  sometimes takes few attempts to reach the operators, when requested an ambulance it take 4-5 hours for an ambulance to reach the patient. additionally, those undergoing the treatment at Covid Hotels and at home are assigned with general practitioner  who is supposed to check on the patients on a daily basis, however due to the volume of infected, it becomes challenging to reach every patient for advice on treatment and procedures. Thus many remain uninformed on basic treatment procedures to tackle Covid19.  

Solution: 
In order to provide peer to peer support and inform everyone in need, one of the medical staff representatives in Adjara region of Georgia created an informal group on social media, where people who are either Covid infected and or know someone who is infected become members of the group. the group has already almost 13000 members. the purpose of the group is to provide support to those infected, share experience from those who have already recovered from the Covid, share information on the situations in different hospitals (from those who are undergoing the treatment) and share contact information of DPs who are volunteering to provide phone call advice to the Covid Patients. with this simple solution, citizens are supporting each other through hard times, since the medical sector is failing to provide adequate services and attention to all who are in need.
