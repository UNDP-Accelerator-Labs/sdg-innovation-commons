## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Grounding GESI in power instead of gender was feasible to remove bias attached to gender  - Having a focal point for GESI in projects was useful in terms of integration - GESI not being a core driver or necessarily led it to be under utilized and prioritized with other engagements taking precedence (COVID, cyclone, delivery) - The Gender indicators in UNDP have a 2 year cycle which didn't incentivize participation and hence alignment with project cycles is needed.
- A lot of buy in for GESI work came from individuals who were aligned on gender issues already and was driven by these personalities

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

COVID-19, Cyclone took away the attention from GESI as projects had to repurpose their programming. Change in project level leadership also impacted the momentum of the work

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We brought the project team together to discuss the integration of GESI and carried gender workshops where we co-developed the gender action plan. This gave us an opportunity to uncover the dynamics of the team towards gender issues and collect their past experiences and future aspirations. At the end we developed a portfolio of pilots which are soon to be tested.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Co-creation and participatory design was used to ensure ownership of the GESI pilots. Regular design sprints allowed for the team to step back and away from other tasks and engage on GESI. Visual thinking was critical for communicate our plans and intent to donors and within UNDP. Finally, pilots portfolio created a medley of opportunities that the team could pursue for integration
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We interviewed CSOs working in gender to understand best practice. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We interviewed with Fiji Women Fund on their grant disbursement process which could help us integrate GESI in our grants process

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Fiji Women Fund was an unusual partner as they are a feminist fund focusing on grassroots organizations which UNDP did not have previous experience with

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UN Women was one of our initial partners who guided this work and there was potential overlap explored in the project and the work of UN Women. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Create a safe space for exploration knowing that the topic at hand was sightly contentious and new
