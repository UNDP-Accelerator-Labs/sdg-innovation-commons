## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Supporting public innovation capacity development 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that there is a certain disparity between public organizations to face the challenges of development effectively and efficiently in a context of complexity and uncertainty of public challenges.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The need to innovate in the public sector has been recognized many decades ago in our country. However, innovation is not always incorporated at the core of governance and remains as something that outlies of what a government usually does. Outdated regulations, lack of resources and no short-term results operate as deterrents to embed innovation both at a strategic level and into day-to-day operations of public institutions. Complex development challenges require a new generation of institutional architectures of public policy and governance models. This represents challenges for governments where a reductionist approach usually prevails, resulting in communication problems, a lack of agility to respond to emerging problems, and a sub-optimization of the impact of public policies.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Uruguay Accelerator Lab is seen as a key partner to develop public innovation capacities within governments due to its expertise and potential nexus with other successful experiences around the world. What is more, UNDP´s role in the country has largely been identified with developing plans and capacity building with governments. The proposal aims to strengthen
capacities to activate an experimentation portfolio logic and achieve demonstrative actions towards new forms of management for sub-national governments that could demonstrate that strategic innovation can improve
effective governance. The Montevideo and Canelones municipalities are two relevant cases where innovation and experimentation are in an incipient phase. Through MVD Lab and the Dinamo’s space, they explore a new way to operate in
the field.  

 





> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



UNDP Uruguay AccLab is working on developing public innovation capabilities with governments. From strategic innovation platforms to open innovation contests, UNDP is strengthening national and subnational institutions for an effective and efficient governance in a world of high uncertainty and complexity. 
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.



<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the partner:



Subnational Governments (Intendencias de Montevideo, Canelones and Treinta y Tres)


</div>



<div class="group">


> What sector does our partner belong to?



</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



We want to work with subnational governments to help them to have a greater diversity of tools and approaches to face their challenges. We want them to rely on collective intelligence to design solutions to the great challenges of development. For instance:

-         Working together to implement their own innovation laboratories.

-         Working together to implement system thinking approaches.

-         Creating a national network within all the labs with focus on innovation, collaboration, co-creation.

Inau is the national institution of children and youth in our country. We will design an experiment to test whether an open

innovation challenge can improve public servants' motivation.

The University of Warwick, through the participation of researchers, will develop the practical component of the
experimental process with civil servants to determine the impact of innovation processes on worker performance.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can UNDP foster public sector innovation? Can we address complex development challenges through cooperation in public
innovation with governments? How to generate innovation capacities within public institutions? How to promote the effective participation of citizens in public policy?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



- Sensemaking: we aim to develop sensemaking exercises with subnational governments to connect current initiatives with
topics and new prototypes through a system thinking approach. 



- Ethnography: through creating personas we will transform contents from different deep listening channels into metanarratives to build prototypes.  




- Prototyping: we aim to cocreate a portfolio of prototypes to
understand how a complex system reacts with subnational governments 




- Randomized Control Trials: we are going to test with an RCT how an open innovation challenge can influence public servant's motivation to work.




- Regulatory Sandboxes: we aim to develop a regulatory sandbox to understand how a different approach to waste management and informal recyclers may work in the future. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Many different sources of data and listening channels are going to be used in order to develop a systemic portfolio or prototypes with subnational governments through a deep demonstrations process.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Both national and subnational governments will be the champions of this challenge. Financing institutions should be informed in order to collaborate on implementing prototypes. Successful experiences have the potential of being replicated in other countries and UNDP Country Offices.
