> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation is to bring authoship and publishing Services home. Many people that have written books have no idea on where to publish from within the country and the international Service providers are extremely expensive, often with unfair terms on royalties and payments of royalties. This innovation brings affordable services regarding book publishing, fairness and sencerity in managing clients work

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Many people in Zambia have no idea about starting to write a book and latter on have it published to international standards. This innovation is meant to bring confidence to book writers who want to have their work published and distributed world wide. At an affordable fee, we will help our clients to have success in their book writing aspirations.

> Technical Feasibility

We will receive not up to standard manuscripts, we will proof read, edit and correct all errors. We will design the book and it's covers, we will affix ISBN numbers and publish the books and distribute them to bookshops online. The writers can also print their work and sell them locally.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Books contain information, this information will not remain with the Author but be delivered to intended audience. Information is very vital to human life.
