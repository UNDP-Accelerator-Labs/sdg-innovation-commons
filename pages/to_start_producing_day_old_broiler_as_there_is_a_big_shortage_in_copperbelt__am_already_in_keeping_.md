> Title of the innovation

To start producing day old broiler as there is a big Shortage in copperbelt .am already in keeping broilers so if I can be funded then alot can benefit

> Brief description of the innovation

Am  based in copperbelt I have seen a big Shortage in day old broilers here for it takes about three months to get the birds when you order. I personally I keep  broilers but my vision is to start producing day old broilers which will really help alot of Farmers who are into poutry product.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Here there is a high demand of chickens in copperbelt specific luanshya. I started with 100 birds .I invested a k6000 and I earned k10,000 profit k4000 and I increased the number to 200 which am expecting to get k20000 which will give me a profit if k10000 . So if I can be funded to go commercial  I want to be producing day old  .and I need to buy a farm and continue with my journey of poultry farm. My vision is to grow the farm as a graduate in agribusiness management I have seen that I can make alot of money just from the few birds I keeped. I can employ my youths here who are doing nothing.

> Technical Feasibility

My plan like I said earlier is to solve the problem here about the shortage which is growing here in copperbelt .if I can be funded I want to continue with the journey I have started for poultry. Because few people are in day old broilers production .and that's my goal to what I have done I believe with God is it possible

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can improve the life's of people because alot of people want to go into keeping broilers but there is really a shortage so when we start producing alot of people will have access to day old and start their business
