## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We were unable to leverage large data sources, since it was important to work alongside the Namibia Statistic Agency - and the timing was bad for them as they were busy with a census exercise.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Understanding the challenges from a grassroots level helped us see the flaws in the system and the governance challenges.
## Partners

We worked with the community / vendors directly

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We were unconstrained by the bureacracy of UNDP and we were in the field actually engaging the community and observing the challenges.
