DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
This document is the Digital Readiness Strategy (DRS) to advance the use of digital resources and

technologies for disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) and climate change adaptation (CCA)

in the Philippines. The DRS draws from the findings of the Data Governance Study (DGS) organized

into two components: First, to measure the institutional capacity of the Prevention and Mitigation (P&M)

member agencies using the Digital Disaster Risk Reduction Maturity Model (DDRRMM). The DDRRMM

is an assessment tool that provides a vision of the mature or optimal level that Disaster Risk Reduction

and Management (DRRM) stakeholders can achieve using digital resources and technologies (DR&T).

The second component aimed to understand or “paint the picture” of the current digital DRRM-CCA

landscape in the Philippines by characterizing the flow of data and identifying potential gaps and needs

towards implementing data-driven decision-making. The significant gaps and issues confronting the

Philippines’ DRRM and CCA based on the findings of both components are: the presence of overlapping

functions across numerous digital platforms, data access, and sharing are not seamless, limited human

and financial resources capacities, and formulating DRRM-CCA plans and conducting assessments are

challenging for LGUs.

The DRS and its corresponding actions are intended to contribute to achieving the national DRRM

vision - safer, adaptive, disaster-resilient Filipino communities toward sustainable development,

outlined in the NDRRMP 2020-2030. The DRS supports Outcome 1 of the plan on Improved access,

understanding, and use of updated risk information, DRRM-related statistics, and research. The DRS is

consistent with Prevention and Mitigation Pillar Memo Resolution No. 1 signed in 2021. These outcomes

are: (1) strengthened mechanisms, policies, and institutional arrangements for promoting interoperability

of DRRM-CCA platforms, centered on the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council

(NDRRMC) through streamlined processes and informed recommendations for data code standardization;

(2) enhanced evidence-based decision-making support to NDRRMC, particularly for data management

and data flow-related matters, through a data roster and data flow diagram, among other products and

tools; (3) broadened stakeholder engagement and set up for future collaboration on digitalization of

DRRM-CCA; (4) advanced digital transformation through the accelerated use of technologies and media

in DRRM-CCA; and, (5) institutionalized national data infrastructure.

5

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
The DRS is composed of a three-pronged strategy for digital readiness. This three-pronged strategy

adopts the technology aspect of the DDRRMM, groups the business processes and enabling environment

of the DDRMM under governance, and includes a component highlighting people in the system. The latter

comes from the findings that there is a significant opportunity to build and strengthen the competencies,

capacities, and resources for agency staff and users within the DRRM-CCA ecosystem. Specifically, the

DRS highlights the following strategy: Technology refers to the technical infrastructure and data; people

refer to human capital, and governance refers to how the two other elements are managed or maintained.

All components work together to ensure that the proposed DRS can be sustained indefinitely despite

being dynamic with multiple stakeholders with different mandates or objectives. Under each strategy,

the DRS has specific workstreams. The key differentiator of the DRS is its holistic approach to addressing

problems. Unlike previous projects, which leaned into only one of the three prongs (i.e., Technology,

People, and Governance), the workstreams recognize that all three interact and affect one another. The

impact of solving the issues under one prong has historically been lackluster. Combining the outputs

of past initiatives, the DRS’ holistic approach, and the support of all stakeholders, the vision of safer,

adaptive, disaster-resilient Filipino communities toward sustainable development is achievable.

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
1.1 Background of the DRS

In 2021, the Prevention and Mitigation (P&M) Pillar of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and

Management Council (NDRRMC) in partnership with the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and the United

Nations Development Programme (UNDP) initiated a data governance study (DGS) to answer two

essential questions: How are we doing in the digitalization of DRRM-CCA in the Philippines? How and

where should digital transformation intervene to improve the country’s digital ecosystem?

To answer the questions, the study was organized into two components: First, to measure the institutional

capacity of the Prevention and Mitigation (P&M) member agencies using the Digital Disaster Risk

Reduction Maturity Model (DDRRMM). The DDRRMM is an assessment tool that provides a vision of the

mature or optimal level that Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) stakeholders in the country

can achieve using digital resources and technologies (DR&T). It enables DRRM managers, decision-

makers, and other stakeholders to be aware of where their institutions stand from the optimal utilization

of DR&T, help them identify the gaps, and enhance their understanding of the strengths, weaknesses,

opportunities, and threats (SWOTs) they face in harnessing the full potential of advanced DR&T for DRRM.

It also propels them to improve performance in the use of DR&T for DRRM by specifying the features and

functions they are currently lacking, identify best practices they want to adopt, and chart roadmaps to

achieve the next level of maturity. Lastly, the tool provides the first step for DRRM institutions to assess

where they stand from realizing the full potential of DR&T identify a path for improvement, transition to

the following steps, and measure their progress.

The second component of the DGS aimed to understand or “paint the picture” of the current digital

DRRM-CCA landscape in the Philippines by characterizing the flow of data and identifying potential gaps

and needs towards implementing data-driven decision-making in the country.

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
For the DDRRMM Assessment component of the DGS, a total of 15 P&M pillar member agencies¹1 and two

government partners² in disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) and climate change adaptation

(CCA) provided their institutional assessment. To complement the survey, interviews were conducted

with selected P&M member agencies³ to understand their respective digital platforms further. During

the interviews, the study team used the same assessment tool to generate further information and

validate their initial assessments. The agencies were selected based on the following criteria: DRRM

and CCA mandate; the business process for DRRM and CCA functions; enabling environment practiced

by the institution (e.g., data governance, institutional set-up, policy, data sharing arrangements); and,

technological applications (e.g. utilization of digital data & ICT systems for DRRM and CCA).

A data mapping was carried out to understand and “paint the picture” of the current digital DRRM and

CCA landscape in the country. The mapping covered the pre-disaster, disaster, and post-disaster phases,

including the CDRA process, real-time hydro-meteorological and geological hazards, the NLDR, and the

Rapid Disaster Assessment and Needs Analysis (RDANA)/Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). The

DGS consolidated the high level DRRM-CCA data requirements for the abovementioned elements. Part

of this component is conducting a non exhaustive DRRM and CCA Inventory to account for datasets

being collected, managed, or maintained by different stakeholders to have a baseline of existing data

assets. After the mapping and inventory, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) was developed to document and

trace the flow of DRRM and CCA.

In this component four types of stakeholders were engaged: the platform holders or stakeholders that

own specialized platforms/digital solutions that use datasets to generate value for stakeholders; data

users or stakeholders who receive or use raw/processed/analyzed data to generate value for themselves

or others without necessarily owning specialized/digital solutions; data generators or stakeholders

that capture and generate data/information that platforms or other stakeholders can use; and, process

holders or mandated agencies that influence data flow by control mechanisms such as needed datasets

to deliver a service, restricting data usage, or necessitating safeguards.

A total of 10 organizations⁴2 participated in the data inventory process. To enrich the information collected

from the DRRM and CCA data mapping process, the LGUs were engaged in a survey to get a picture

of their existing climate and disaster data to support their pre-, during, and post-disaster planning and

action. Furthermore, the survey intended to examine the LGUs’ experiences accessing and using DRRM

and CCA data in the existing digital platforms. A total of 72 LGU officials participated in the survey coming

from 3 provinces and 37 city/municipalities. For the regional coverage of the LGUs that participated and

a breakdown of LGU respondents, where almost 57.5% of LGUs were municipal-level⁵, 36% were city-

level⁶, and 7.5% were province-level⁷. Questions related to DRRM and CCA data were also integrated into

a nationwide survey on the readiness of LGUs for the Mandanas Ruling initiated by UNDP. A total of 549

LGUs participated in the survey. The DGS integrated the inputs of LGUs related to the scope of the study.

1.2 Findings of the DGS

The DGS revealed significant insights that provide more context on the current of the DRRM-CCA digital

ecosystem in the country at the time of the project undertaking. It is intended to be a static snapshot that

can be reassessed and updated by key stakeholders in the future.

As illustrated in the DGS, careful processing and analysis were done after gathering data from agencies’

DDRRMM assessment and data inventory responses. In particular, after the responses were collected

and collated, the back-end processing was automated to produce an output ready for dashboard

visualization. This visualization supported the analysis of areas that agencies are already mature in and

areas for improvement. For further contextualization, these opportunity areas were further illuminate

with the significant qualitative findings from the guided interviews and survey responses from these

agencies, allowing us to further understand the gaps and challenges that hinder their maturity journeys.

Figure 1 shows the significant gaps and issues confronting the Philippines’ DRRM and CCA digital

ecosystem and data governance, namely: i) the presence of overlapping functions across numerous

digital platforms, data access, and sharing is not seamless; ii) limited human and financial resources

capacities; and iii) formulating DRRM-CCA plans and conducting assessments are challenging for LGUs.

Figure 1: Gaps and Challenges in DRRM-CCA Data Governance in the Philippines

11

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Presence of overlapping functions across numerous digital
platforms.

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) produced in the DGS demonstrates an absence of a centralized/unified

data warehouse and sharing platform that contains all the needed information to develop plans and

assessments. In sum, the DGS identified 15 web applications, one local application, 13 websites, and 16

flat files for a total of 46 data interfaces. These platforms and applications have overlapping functions,

and the linkage between platforms is not clearly defined. Moreover, different platforms with overlapping

functions, if not resolved would result in serious problems such as worsening the existing problem, lost

opportunity cost, disjointed and unharmonized data exchange among DRRM-CCA stakeholders in the

country.

The abovementioned governance issues have significant implications for vulnerable individuals who are

differentially and disproportionately impacted by disasters. In a separate study commissioned by UNDP

entitled, Mapping and Analysis of Vulnerable Groups for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk

Reduction (CCA-DRR) in Support of the Digital Readiness Strategy in the Philippines, it was revealed that

how having little or no access to online services due to multi-dimensional barriers that hinder their use of

technologies. Also, the study found differing levels of technology access and digital literacy. For instance,

there are digital interventions available, but they are oriented more towards the general public, and

some resulting in widening the digital divide rather than closing it. The study highlighted that persons

with disabilities, women, farmers, and fisherfolk, among others, require government support and access

to life-saving and life-sustaining information. The study recognized that some might have access to and

control resources to increase their capacity to adapt; still, a significant segment of the population is left

behind and require further progress in this space, without intervention on approach, will only continue

to widen the gap.

12

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Data access and sharing are not seamless.

The second challenge is that data access and sharing is not seamless. The study revealed that data

required to develop plans and conduct assessments are not easily accessible. This concern is inevitable

given the presence of various platforms. Related to this point, the study found the lack of a central ledger/

document/agency that orchestrates/manages data access. Data sharing is sometimes not digital, and

much of the data is stored in servers that are on-premise, which is challenging to transfer because these

servers are not remotely accessible. An implication of this is that those who require the data stored in

those on-premise servers have to travel physically to the servers’ location to access the data.

At the same time, the issue of access and sharing is also evident in the prevailing practice where in some

cases, data collected lives within the agency that manages it and is not easily accessible to potential

users. This practice is prominent both at the national and local government levels. At the national

government level, stakeholders find it difficult to secure data from other agencies. Data sharing and

access are restricted in some local government offices at the local government level.

Similarly, the study found the lack of a unified data framework resulting in fragmented and inadequate

data management and cataloging systems within the agencies. The absence of such practices and

features makes it difficult for other users to contextualize the data and use it to unlock other opportunities

because protocols and routines differ from agency to agency. In addition, requesting data from agencies

is not standardized due to the lack of a data-sharing framework and strategy. It resulted in redundancy

and multiple data-sharing agreements (DSAs) created to access numerous datasets from other agencies.

While multiple DSAs are not necessarily a problem, in this case it can be a symptom of the problem.

Because the current ecosystem contains siloed and overlapping data flows and connections, the multiple

DSAs add difficulty and complexity in coordinating data sharing efforts across independent platforms and

agency-to-agency data flow relationships, especially when specific needs and data sharing methods are

required for each agency. This not only hinders efficiency, but requires more manpower in the process.

This is further supported by the DDRRMM framework, which cites “fragmented and uncoordinated

deployment” as a barrier in DR&T maturity. The study likewise revealed the limited familiarity with ISO

13

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
standards across all elements, redundancies, and duplications in datasets within agencies, the data

format is not standard across the agencies, and low capacity on big data capability - all making data

access and sharing a significant challenge.

Limited human and financial resources capacities.

The third significant challenge is the limited human and financial resource capacities. The study found

gaps that are common at both national and local levels: insufficient number of human resources with

knowledge and technical skills on big data and digital technology; high staff turnover; limited funding

for skills and competency enhancement and procurement of equipment; and insufficient data storage

and data management practices. Additionally, at the LGU level, both as data generators and users have

insufficient of human resources and the limited capacity of the current workforce are the primary factors

that hinder LGUs from accessing information from existing digital platforms and developing the Climate

and Disaster Risk Assessment (CDRA), Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDANA), and the Post-

Disaster and Needs Assessment (PDNA).

14

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Formulating DRRM-CCA plans and conducting assessments
are challenging for LGUs.

The LGUs play an important role as data generators. The exposure database they have could help

improve existing platforms if they will share data to platform holders. Apart from being data generators,

the LGUs are among the key data users. Thus, there must be an enabling environment to effectively,

efficiently, and appropriately assess to formulate and develop required plans. However, the study found

that for LGUs, preparing DRRM-CCA plans and conducting assessments are difficult. This is due to two

reasons: Absence of a centralized/unified data warehouse and sharing platform that contains all the

needed information to develop plans and conduct assessments; and, Multiple platforms display the

same data, and LGUs are unsure which platform to use.

Given this, LGUs face significant challenges in creating their own localized exposure database, which

contain granular data on their LGU, for the following reasons: Essential minimum elements needed are

unavailable to LGUs; and, Data sources are provided to LGUs through a guidebook, but the information

needed is scattered across multiple agencies and platforms, and there are numerous potential data

sources. With this context in mind, the current human resources have significantly limited capacity for

digital technologies. The study also found that only a portion of LGUs can formulate their Local Disaster

Risk Reduction and Management Plan (LDRRMP) and Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP) and

develop CDRA without external assistance. Finally, the study revealed that with regards to the alignment

of digital resources and technologies with DRRM coordination and collaboration, the combined overall

maturity level of the Philippines - planned but with no resources available to achieve the capability.

It clearly demonstrates the need to strengthen further institutional and individual capacities on using

digital resources and technologies to advance DRRM-CCA in the country.

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Following the findings of the DGS, this section presents the Digital Readiness Strategy (DRS) to optimize

the use of digital resources and technologies towards achieving the national DRRM vision of - safer,

adaptive, disaster-resilient Filipino communities toward sustainable development.

In October 2020, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) approved the

National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP) 2020 - 2030. The plan is the updated

version of the NDRRMP 2011 - 2028. The revised plan links disaster risk reduction and management

(DRRM), climate change adaptation (CCA), and human security by focusing on climate and disaster risks.

It aims to achieve the shared goals in risk reduction, resilience building, human security, and sustainable

development (NDRRMC 2020). As the primary blueprint for DRRM in the Philippines, the plan: provides

strategic direction and guidance to national government agencies (NGAs), local government units (LGUs),

civil society organizations (CSOs), private sector, and development partners on disaster and climate-

resilience actions in the Philippines; strengthens disaster and climate risk governance by clarifying the

roles, accountabilities, strategies, and activities of disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM)

stakeholders at all levels; strengthens linkages and interoperability of the DRRM thematic pillars; ensures

the convergence of and synergy between DRRM and CCA; and, contributes to the achievement and

coherence of global, regional, and national development and policy agenda (NDRRMC 2020).

17

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
During the review of the NDRRMP 2011-2028, data governance-related concerns such as the unavailability

of science-informed and evidence-based risk maps and lack of access to data and knowledge

management system are manifested as among the critical gaps and challenges in the implementation

of DRRM in the country. Further, the data access and awareness and the ability of communities to use

digital technologies and solutions were identified as crucial gaps. In recognition of the pivotal role of data

in risk governance, the NDRRMP 2020-2030 emphasizes strengthening the digital infrastructure and

ecosystem not only to address data governance issues but to ensure that vulnerable and marginalized

communities will experience the benefits of digitalization and technological solutions so that no one will

be left behind. In particular, the plan sets a clear mandate and direction to address data governance

issues and concerns through advancing digital transformation to achieve the NDRRMP’s vision. Increased

investments in digital infrastructure, digital readiness, data governance, and addressing the digital divide

are indispensable to achieving this. The NDRRMP 2020 - 2030 also promotes robust data governance

mechanisms to address challenges on the data source, access, quality, sharing, distribution, and use in

risk reduction.

As shown in Figure 2, Outcome 1 of the NDRRMP 2020 - 2030 - Improved access, understanding, and

use of updated risk information, DRR-related statistics, and research - prioritizes data governance-related

outputs such as Output 1 on Disaster and climate-risk information, Output 2 on Information management

and systems, and Output 3 on Standards of DRR-related statistics. Ultimately, upon effective and efficient

implementation of the plan, national stakeholders, including marginalized communities, are expected to

benefit from the following outcomes:

1. Strengthened mechanisms, policies, and institutional arrangements for promoting interoperability

of DRRM-CCA platforms, centered on the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management

Council (NDRRMC) through streamlined processes and informed recommendations for data

code standardization;

2. Enhanced evidence-based decision-making support to NDRRMC, particularly for data

management and data flow-related matters, through a data roster and data flow diagram, among

18

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
other products and tools;

3. Broadened stakeholder engagement and set up for future collaboration on digitalization of

DRRM-CCA:

4. Advanced digital transformation through the accelerated use of technologies and media in

DRRM-CCA; and,

5.

Institutionalized national data infrastructure.

The abovementioned policy pronouncements reflect the government’s commitment to optimizing the

use of digital resources and technologies in DRRM-CCA while considering the whole-of-government and

whole-of-society approaches.

The following sections present the DRS in detail as shown in Figure 2.

2.1 Three-pronged Strategy for Digital Readiness

As described in the DDRRMM White Paper, digital maturity is a function of technology features, business

processes, and an enabling environment. In the context of the findings of the Data Governance Study,

a three-pronged strategy was developed to more easily understand and group the identified gaps and

challenges as well as articulate the recommendations. This three-pronged strategy adopts the technology

aspect of the DDRRMM, groups the business processes and enabling environment of the DDRMM under

governance, and also includes a component highlighting people in the system. The latter addition

comes from the findings that there is significant opportunity to build and strengthen the competencies,

capacities, and resources for agency staff and users within the DRRM-CCA ecosystem.

Aside from utilizing the DDRRMM as a tool to measure the institutional capacity of agencies, mapping the

data through the data flow diagram also provided a different lens to analyze the ecosystem, particularly

the relationships and connections between and among the data generators and users. The investigative

approach and questions presented by the DFD added more qualitative context to the gaps and challenges,

20

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
and provided more information in developing the recommendations under the three components of the

strategy.

This chapter presents the said three-pronged strategy for digital readiness. Technology refers to the

technical infrastructure and data, while people refers to human capital, and governance refers to how

the two other elements are managed or maintained. All components work together to ensure that the

proposed DRS can be sustained indefinitely despite being dynamic with multiple stakeholders with

different mandates or objectives.

The strategy detailed in this chapter builds on the previous initiatives with similar objectives. The key

differentiator of the DRS is its holistic approach to addressing problems. Unlike previous projects which

leaned into only one of the three prongs (i.e. Technology, People, and Governance), the workstreams

recognizes that all three interact and affect one another. The impact of solving the issues under one prong

has historically been lackluster. Combining the outputs of past initiatives, the DRS’ holistic approach,

and the support of all stakeholders, the vision of safer, adaptive, disaster-resilient Filipino communities

toward sustainable development is achievable.

Governance

The governance component, as mentioned above, covers processes and the enabling environment

that encourage DR&T maturity. In this case, this captures the need to develop a unified interagency

Data Governance Framework, ensure data quality, identify and reduce duplications and overlaps of

datasets in the ecosystem, standardize and monitor LGU planning and assessment, and strengthen

institutionalization and partnerships for DRRM.

As previously discussed, these strategies are based on the findings of the DDRRMM results and the

DFD. In particular, there is a need for a unified interagency Data Governance framework to address

fragmented mechanisms in the system, which have resulted in siloed data platforms and redundancies

21

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
in datasets, data exchange and flows, and data sharing agreements. Part of this component is the need

to ensure data quality to address insufficiencies in quality assurance/assessment, data standardization

protocols, storage and management practices, and the absence of established feedback mechanisms.

As part of governance, there is also a need to better support LGUs to strengthen their roles as data

generators and users, as well as in their need to prepare and complete the CDRA and other planning

and assessment outputs. Related to this, the governance component emphasizes the need to strengthen

institutionalization and partnerships for DRRM to address the siloed initiatives and establish the feedback

mechanism for stakeholders. Because the seventh DDRRMM component on Alignment with DRR

Coordination and Collaboration is the lowest score for the Philippine agencies at the time of this study,

there is significant room to improve the collaborative efforts of the DRRM-CCA agencies.

People

Under the second component of the strategy, ensuring the availability and sufficient capacities of users

and staff are emphasized. In particular, this component highlights the need to build and strengthen the

human capital of national government agencies as well as the need to support and capacitate the human

resources of local government.

Based on the DDRRMM and DFD results of the DGS, these recommendations stem from the findings that

agencies have low capacity for big data capability and machine learning knowledge and skills, insufficient

human resources with expertise and technical skills on big data and digital technology. Additionally, it

was found that there was high staff turnover in multiple agencies and limited funding allocated for skills

and competency enhancement.

As for the local government units, the study also found limited funding for skills and competency

enhancement and only a portion of LGUs with the resources and capacity to formulate DRRM-CCA plans

and assessments without external assistance.

22

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
For both national and local government, the strategies in this component are meant to complement

those in the governance component as well. The right staff means identifying and onboarding critical

stakeholders with the right skills, experience, and motivation to establish and implement a unified

framework on data governance, access, and sharing. Capacitating the right people means providing

proper training and strengthening user competencies through a comprehensive and coherent human

resource capability-building framework and supported institutionalization and partnership programs.

The recommended strategies under the people ensure that people in the government can understand,

process, and communicate insights from data to other people regardless of their affiliations and

occupations.

Technology

Lastly, the third component is technology, which aims to bolster resources and improve the ICT

infrastructure in the DRRM-CCA ecosystem, and integrate and adapt the DDRRMM framework and

dashboard as a tool to monitor and guide the digital maturity of stakeholders.

It should be emphasized here that while the scope of the study’s findings emphasizes the digital ecosystem

of DRRM-CCA in the Philippines, technology is just one component of the system of solutions. The overall

framework aims to provide a more comprehensive view and approach to the gaps and challenges, with

technology as one of the three overall components as a means to bring the ecosystem to a higher level

of maturity.

From the findings of the DGS, it was found that there are insufficient funds that limit the procurement of

software and hardware as well as the enhancement of skills and competencies. In addition, the study

found that most respondents of the DDRRMM framework were not familiar with the relevant ISO standards

for DR&T–an indicator that an agency is nearing or has achieved its optimal state of digital maturity.

With that, one of the central recommendations in this component is the establishment of a DRRM system

with a centralized and interoperable data warehouse, which will require the allocation of sufficient

23

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
financial resources to bolster the agencies’ current information and communications technology (ICT)

infrastructure, each according to their present maturity levels. In achieving this and in taking the overall

strategy further, the DDRRMM Dashboard can be leveraged to support and guide agencies in improving

their maturity levels across the use of digital resources and tools. This way, government agencies can

not only direct their improvements towards compliance with international standards but also strengthen

their coordination, collaboration, and alignment with one another towards this goal. For example, the

DDRRMM results show that the current maturity score of the Philippines is 2.76 out of 5, based on

the agencies that participated in the study. Stakeholders can zoom in to see where specific agencies

can improve on. For instance, a cross-cutting issue for DOST-PAGASA, DOST-PHIVOLCS, OCD, and

UPRI is ICT infrastructure, based on their scores showing that there is insufficient implementation for

computing and network infrastructure. Boosting this through additional resources for full implementation,

performance assessment, and compliance with national standards will increase the score from the 2-3

range (Recognized or Defined) to 5 (Optimized).

2.2 Towards the Ideal High-Level System Structure for
DRRM Data

2.2.1 Recalling the NDRRMP Outcome Indicators and DRRM Ecosystem

Stakeholders

Outcome 1 of the NDRRMP is “Improve access, understanding, and use of updated risk information, DRR-

related statistics, and research.” Many of the indicators that demonstrate the achievement of this outcome

involve the active participation of LGUs as both data users and data generators and the accomplishment

of requisite tasks. These indicators, as stated in the NDRRMP, are as follows:

• Percentage of municipalities with an improved understanding of hazard and risk information;

• Percentage of the 42,045 barangays with improved access to accurate hazards and risk

information in online mapping platforms by 2022;

• Percentage of healthcare facilities/hospitals with improved access to hazard and risk assessment

data present in the area;

•

Integrated system for risk information and research to inform the planning process in formats

accessible to all stakeholders;

• Percentage of indicators aligned to international and national DRRM frameworks covering the

access, understanding, and use of updated risk information and research; and,

• Percentage of LGUs that align reporting to the international and national DRRM frameworks

covering the access, understanding, and use of updated risk information and research.

The DGS recognizes the role of LGUs and portrays their importance by establishing that LGUs are one of

the core data users within the system since access to information is crucial in crafting data-driven policies

and programs. Furthermore, as emphasized by members of the Technical Working Group, LGUs are also

data generators that play a critical role in providing information back to the NGAs. The DFD of the DGS

revealed that LGUs have not been able to serve as data generators due to constraints in resources and

25

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
human capacities.

Aside from acknowledging the role of LGUs, the DGS surfaces the involvement of other stakeholders such

as various NGAs, CSOs, the private sector, and the public. These stakeholders have been consuming

data through data interfaces accessible to them. This has resulted in the proliferation of various platforms

that fulfill their specific needs with limited options to give back to their providers of data. The proposed

system addresses this by granting potential governmental and non-governmental contributors (e.g.

scientists, mappers) a secure and automated avenue to provide data. All stakeholders are accounted for

in creating the proposed, ideal, high-level structure.

The NDRRMP also highlights the importance of one integrated information system between various

NGAs, including DENR-NAMRIA, DENR-MGB, DOST-PAGASA, and DOST-PHIVOLCS, among others. The

proposed structure extends this feature to other stakeholders to better facilitate the achievement of the

national vision mentioned above.

2.2.2 Connecting the DGS Findings to the Ideal System Structure

The previous chapters describe the aspects that characterize a mature DR&T system and how these

characteristics combined with the identified areas of improvement, evolved into three strategic foci. Using

the findings of the DGS, this chapter aims to provide a more detailed sequence of activities that bridges

the gap between the present situation and a more optimal setup, where a DRRM system containing a

centralized data warehouse and complementary data interfaces is the main output.

An optimal setup implies that a DRRM ecosystem in a country is mature which signifies that people,

technology, and governance aspects of the framework are harmonious working together. In the NDRRMP,

this is encompassed in Outcome 1 of Thematic Area I: Disaster Prevention and Mitigation. Combining this

component of the NDRRMP with the DDRRMM framework reveals a more concrete picture of the gaps in

the Philippines’ DRRM Ecosystem.

26

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
The identification of these gaps were done through the DGS, where four main barriers were identified.

• Presence of overlapping functions across numerous digital platforms

• Data access and sharing are not seamless

•

Limited human and financial resources capacities

• Formulating DRRM-CCA plans and conducting assessments are challenging for LGUs

To fill the identified gaps and achieve the national vision, there needs to be a sustained DRRM system

that ensures the quality and integrity of data, while facilitating data exchange and information sharing

for the benefit of government units, development partners, and non-government stakeholders. Table 1

provides direct high-level solutions to the gaps from the DGS.

A strategy involving a DRRM system that encapsulates the enumerated solutions in Table 1 is described

in the succeeding sections of this paper. The DRRM system needed is described through the ideal high-

level system structure and the high-level activities and timelines are presented in the workstreams.

Case Studies of National Digitization Efforts

The examples presented below are nationwide efforts that leverage technology as a means to solve
multidisciplinary problems covering applications in mobility, security, healthcare, education, manufacturing,
and governance among other areas. In all three examples, technology, when supplemented with the
appropriate systems and support in place, served as an enabler of solutions that harmonized different
facets of society.

• Estonia’s X-Road project is the backbone of the country’s digitalization. The ability to bridge
different information systems to service different parts of Estonian society is at the core of
X-Road.

• Thailand 4.0 is an economic model that aims to overcome several of Thailand’s most pressing
challenges through innovation, technology, and creativity as drivers of a value-based economy.
• The Australian Spatial Data Infrastructure (ASDI) is a national framework that aims to bridge

•

spatial data providers to all sectors of society.
Japan’s 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan which describes Society 5.0, “A human-centered
society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social problems by a system
that highly integrates cyberspace and physical space.”

2.2.3 The Ideal High-level System Structure

Based on the DDRRMM framework, every mature DR&T ecosystem has 6 characteristics: full support

to DRRM, a platform for development, scalability, shared geospatial infrastructure, adaptability, and

creditability. The high-level solutions found in Table 1 also present two additional requirements for the

ideal DRRM system.

• Presence of data interfaces or platforms that provide functions that fulfill the requirements of

specific users

• Availability of features to automatically consolidate, retrieve, and provide data to and from

different users and providers

The enumerated characteristics and requirements both point to a system that centralizes the retrieval,

storage, and provision of data to and from multiple data sources. Focusing solely on the technological

aspect of the system, three major components are needed in the system. One is for data storage, second

is the data processing components, and the last is the means to transport the data in and out of the

storage solution through a data interface.

28

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Two digital storage options can serve the needs of this system, a data lake and a data warehouse. The

latter is more scalable and more easily maintainable in the long run due to a data warehouse’s structured

nature. As for the data interface, this can be as simple as a form submission or as complex as a dedicated

web platform with cross platform functionalities. The feature that enables this is the data processing

component within the system. Different data interfaces will require different data processing components

and data interface features will vary depending on the needs of the high priority stakeholders.

Regardless of the more granular requirements, the ideal high-level system structure will remain the same.

Figure 3 shows the proposed ideal high-level system structure. Table 2 describes the components of

Figure 3.

Table 2: Components from the Data Flow Diagram

The data ecosystem portrayed in the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) of the DGS contained several components

as representations of real-world organizations, connections, and tools. The succeeding sections use the

same features to describe the ideal high-level system structure of a mature DR&T ecosystem for the

Philippines. Those components are streamlined and enumerated in Table 2 with descriptions of what

they represent.

29

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Figure 3: Ideal High-level System Structure of the Philippines’ DRRM System

At the center of this ideal high level DRRM system structure is the centralized data warehouse; particularly

DOST’s GeoRiskPH’s Data Warehouse. The data warehouse connects to different data interfaces

used by several users to fulfill their varying needs. They share a single source of data that adheres to

predetermined standards.

The recommendation to use GeoRiskPH comes from the DGS’ findings which revealed that GeoRiskPH

is the most connected data interface compared to all other data interfaces in the DRRM-CCA ecosystem

of the Philippines. GeoRiskPH also has the needed infrastructure, technology, and data management

practices based on the DDRRMM framework. An expansion of GeoRiskPH’s current features to

accommodate more data and data interfaces would be required to fulfill its mandate as the “central

source of information for accurate and efficient hazards and risk assessment.”

30

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
DOST and the DRRM System Administrators are two other entities crucial to establishing this structure. As

the overall steering and leadership of the NDRRMC’s Disaster Prevention and Mitigation pillar, DOST shall

serve as the platform holder of this technology. GeoRiskPH is already hosted using DOST’s resources,

which holds true today. However, scaling the platform may require a new data architecture and additional

resources. The ownership of the data warehouse comes hand-in-hand with their ability to generate and

use the data within the data warehouse.

The second entity is referred to as DRRM System Administrators. This would be a group of representatives

from different government agencies that partake in the DRRM-CCA space in one form or another. These

government agencies should include but are not limited to the OCD, DENR-NAMRIA, DENR-MGB, DOST-

PAGASA, DOST-PHIVOLCS, DILG, and PSA. The DRRM System Administrators are the primary process

holders of the central data warehouse. As the technical experts, the current developers of GeoRiskPH can

be absorbed into this team of DRRM System Administrators and lead the changes in terms of engineering

requirements. Their responsibilities include managing the data warehouse’s schema, facilitating access

and permissions to the data, handling data-sharing partnerships with stakeholders, and implementing

requested changes involving the data warehouse and its content.

The remaining entities in Figure 3 are arbitrary entities representing the stakeholders in the DRRM-CCA

ecosystem. They are all categorized as data users and data generators. This indicates that the entities

connected to the data warehouse can provide data or use the data from the data warehouse. The specific

permissions can be configured depending on the use case.

Lastly, the data interfaces in Figure 3 represent tools and mechanisms that fulfill the requirements of the

data entities. These requirements can include sending, storing, receiving, processing, transforming, and

visualizing data. The owners of these interfaces are the data generators themselves, except for Data

Interface 3, which DOST owns as a means of adhering to the G8 Open Data Charter, which categorizes

geospatial data, earth observation data, and energy and environment data as high-value datasets.

31

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
It is important to note that the indicated data interfaces broadly represent a means to connect to the data

warehouse rather than a representation of a specific platform or technology.

2.3 Workstreams

Based on the data collection activities of the DGS, many of the technologies required to have a mature

DR&T ecosystem are already present in some national government agencies. The DDRRMM scores

portrayed on the DDRRMM Dashboard support this. However, a holistic adoption of technologies, data-

sharing practices, multi-agency collaboration, and sustained capacity building and resource initiatives,

among other factors, are some of the missing attributes of the DRRM-CCA ecosystem in the Philippines.

The ideal structure proposed in the previous section addresses these deficiencies, but such structures

can only be attained once the proper foundation is established. The subsequent parts of this chapter

propose a high-level roadmap that bridges the gap between the prevailing system and a more optimal

arrangement. Requirements that serve as foundational pillars can also be found in the roadmap.

As shown in Figure 4, the roadmap is divided into two parallel workstreams. Both workstreams are

executed simultaneously while following the sequence denoted by the arrows.

The first workstream is the NGA workstream. The primary focus of this workstream is the creation of the

central data warehouse and populating this with data from sources that are already well established.

The second workstream is the LGU workstream which aims to capacitate LGUs to create and execute

DRRM-CCA plans easily. The goal is for LGUs to eventually contribute to the data warehouse as a data

source. Doing so will provide NGAs a more accurate understanding of the impact of disasters based on

the LGUs’ localized, on-the-ground data.

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
2.3.1. The National Government Agency Workstream

Step N1: Standardize the methodology used in creating DRRM-CCA plans.

The first step that initiates the entire plan is the standardization of the methodology used to create

DRRM-CCA plans. This is in line with the NDRRMP’s activity concerning the Standards of DRR-related

statistics output. To some extent, some recommendations and guidelines make creating the DRRM-CCA

plans possible. However, the process is still difficult due to the lack of specificity regarding the formulas,

units of measurement, data types, and data sources.

Example: Ready to Rebuild: Disaster Rehabilitation

and Recovery Planning Guide Workbook

The guidebook was created through a joint project between the NDRRMC, the OCR, and the World
Bank, to provide a rehabilitation and recovery framework to LGUs and NGAs. The guidebook
presents well-devised action points on pre-disaster and post-disaster rehabilitation and recovery.
However, Annex A, which contains the data requirements, lacks the specificity needed to be
database-friendly. Figure 5 provides a screenshot of this annexed table. The absence of a defined
formula, units of measurement, and absolute data sources can be seen.

Figure 5: Pre- and Post-Disaster Rehabilitation and Recovery Guidebook

38

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• Guidelines containing the standard minimum data requirements, methodology, metrics, units of

measure, and specific data sources

Step N2: Gather data user and data generator requirements, and draft and sign

DSAs, ensuring adherence to data privacy principles

For Step N2, the agencies will need to discuss and gather the data user and data generator requirements

for data sharing, which must adhere to the data privacy principles in the Data Privacy Act of 2012, its

Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), and all issuances of the National Privacy Commission (NPC).

These should then be drafted and signed into data sharing agreements. A data-sharing agreement (DSA)

refers to a “contract, joint issuance, or similar document containing the terms and conditions of a data-

sharing arrangement between two or more parties.” Because the process of drafting and signing can

take significant time, this step can coincide with the establishment of technical protocols for creating the

central data warehouse in Step N3.

As the lead agency and independent body with the mandate to administer and implement the DPA, the

NPC has expressed support for digitization efforts in DDR-CCA and can provide further assistance in

pursuing data-sharing agreements for this endeavor.

Some Prerequisites to Drafting Data Sharing Agreements

Refer to the NPC Privacy Toolkit. The NPC has developed and disseminated the Third Edition of the

NPC Privacy Toolkit in May 2018, which serves as a detailed guide for stakeholders to identify the

steps needed to ensure data privacy. This should serve as the main reference for the preparation and

development of the data-sharing agreements and steps after the signing of the DSAs.

Appoint Data Protection Officers. For each government agency, a data privacy officer (DPO) should be

appointed, where they are expected to have expertise in “relevant privacy or data protection policies

39

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
and practices” and “processing operations being carried out by the Personal Information Controller (PIC)

or Personal Information Processor (PIP), including the latter’s information systems, data security and/or

data protection needs.” Among the duties and responsibilities of a DPO listed in the NPC Privacy Toolkit,

highlights include but are not limited to the following:

• monitor the PIC’s or PIP’s compliance with the DPA, its IRR, issuances by the NPC and other

applicable laws and policies;

• advice the PIC or PIP regarding complaints and/or the exercise by data subjects of their rights

(e.g., requests for information, clarifications, rectification or deletion of personal data);

• ensure proper data breach and security incident management by the PIC or PIP, including the

•

•

latter’s preparation and submission to the NPC of reports and other documentation

concerning security incidents or data breaches within the prescribed period;

inform and cultivate awareness on privacy and data protection within the organization of the PIC

or PIP, including all relevant laws, rules and regulations and issuances of the NPC;

• advocate for the development, review and/or revision of policies, guidelines, projects and/or

programs of the PIC or PIP relating to privacy and data protection, by adopting a privacy by

design approach;

•

serve as the contact person of the PIC or PIP vis-à-vis data subjects, the NPC and other authorities

in all matters concerning data privacy or security issues or concerns and the PIC or PIP; and,

•

cooperate, coordinate and seek advice from the NPC regarding matters concerning data privacy

and security.

Conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. Another critical prerequisite to the drafting of data-sharing

agreements, which should begin at the early stages of the initiative, is the conduct of a Privacy Impact

Assessment (PIA). This pertains to the process of “assessing the potential impacts on the privacy of

a process, information system, program, software module, device or other initiatives which processes

personal information and in consultation with stakeholders, for taking actions as necessary to treat

privacy risk.” The results of this PIA report will inform the succeeding data-sharing agreements. The

conduct of a PIA requires the assignment of a designated PIC to conduct a PIA with possible support

40

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
from an assisting PIP.

Draft Memorandum of Agreements. Separate from the DSA, government entities involved are expected

to enter into Memorandum of Agreements, or contracts, where their respective roles are clearly defined

concerning the data sharing processes. The government agencies should define these parameters,

depending on the agreed upon structure and processes to be implemented and adopted.

Draft of Privacy Management Program and Privacy Manual. Aside from conducting a PIA, the NPC

Toolkit also highlights the need for a Privacy Management Program (PMP) to assist PICs and PIPs in

ensuring compliance with the DPA and that no data privacy violations are committed. Essentially, a PMP

ensures that everyone on board is aligned on purpose, expected results, benefits, and roadmap towards

achieving the undertaking. Key components to a PMP include Governance, Program Controls, Continuity

and Establishment of a Privacy Ecosystem and Oversight Plan, and Assessment and Review of Program

Controls.

Secondly, each PIP or PIC is expected to produce a Privacy Manual, detailed in the NPC Toolkit. This is

a guidebook for compliance with the DPA, its IRR, and other relevant issuances of the NPC, as well as

privacy and data protection protocols for specific circumstances (e.g., from collection to destruction).

Requirements in a Data Sharing Agreement

Once the prerequisites cited above and other more detailed information specified in the NPC Toolkit

have been discussed by the entities involved, the respective DSAs can be drafted. The NPC template for

which is attached in Appendix A.

Structurally, the NPC template contains the following information:

• Purpose

•

Identity of all PICs party to the agreement

• Term or duration of the agreement

41

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
• Operational details of the sharing or transfer of personal data

• General description of the security measures for the protection of personal data, including the

policy for retention or disposal of records

•

Inform how a data subject can obtain a copy of the data-sharing agreement

• Details on online access

• Specify the PIC responsible for addressing any information request, or any complaint filed by a

data subject, and/or any investigation by the Commission

•

Identify the method that shall be adopted for the secure return, destruction, or disposal of the

shared data

• Other terms and conditions

These are the parameters in which the government entities involved in the collection, production,

sharing, and processing of DRR-CCA data should be identified. In other words, it is critical that the use

and purpose of the data are clear and that whom the data is shared with is identified.

Data Sharing Agreements for the Centralized Data Warehouse

Based on the proposed high-level structure in Chapter 3, the many entities involved in the data sharing

processes can create separate DSAs to cover specific segments of the said processes.

Generally, there are connections in the proposed structure between NGAs (as data providers) and the

Central Data Warehouse (as a recipient). There are also connections between LGUs (as data providers),

represented by the DILG, and the Central Data Warehouse. Aside from these, there may be connections

between the Central Data Warehouse and other data sources (e.g., CSOs, private sector) that require

DSAs, especially if the data contains personal/sensitive information. After the data is stored in the

warehouse, these same data providers become subsequent recipients or data users of the datasets

stored in the Data Warehouse as the central repository.

The NGAs can opt to have one DSA for each distinct entity connected to the DRRM System Administrators,

42

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
as long as the agreements define the roles and parameters required by the NPC template, as mentioned

above. The same applies for LGUs, which the DILG may represent. Additionally, the DSAs can be amended

if additional use, purpose requirements, or types of data are added or changed later on.

Post-Data Sharing Agreement Requirements

After the DSAs are drafted and signed by the parties involved, there continues to be a need to ensure

compliance with the requirements of the DPA. These include the conduct of regular Privacy Impact

Assessments, the implementation of Data Privacy Policies and related activities based on the Privacy

Management Manual, and the registration of the Data Processing Systems, if applicable. These are

discussed in detail as well in the NPC Toolkit.

The expected outputs of Step N2 are as follows:

• Signed Data Sharing Agreements

•

List of DOST-approved User Requirements for Step N3

Step N3: Establish the requirements, protocols, and architecture needed to scale

GeoRiskPH’s capacity.

The next step requires the different NGAs who partake in the DRRM-CCA space to discuss and determine

the ideal arrangements of multi-agency concerns involving team composition, stakeholder management,

data access policies, and technical requirements. The scores shown on the DDRRMM dashboard can

help guide the technical requirements discussions in this step. Furthermore, this can coincide with the

drafting of DSAs in Step N2. The human resource capacities of different DOST agencies should also be

assessed to fill potential deficiencies in executing the activities in this strategy.

Overall, the output of these discussions shall be an interagency data governance framework that

promotes the accessibility of data and multidisciplinary collaboration. The DRRM system shall be the

application and product of this framework.

43

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
The discussion should at least include the following matters:

• Team composition and succession plans of the DRRM System Administrators;

• Roles and responsibilities of non-governmental institutions who wish to contribute to the data

warehouse;

•

Identifications of priority data users and data generators, and their dataset requirements;

• Data warehouse schema, data sources, ingestion tools, and ingestion schedules;

• Data warehouse architecture and table partitioning;

• Data access policies and permissions involving data users, data generators, platform holder,

and process holder; and,

• Stakeholder management.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• Final DRRM system architecture to be be adopted by GeoRiskPH

• NGA action plans with approved funding allocation from the Department of Budget and

Management

•

Interagency Data Governance Framework approved and validated by members of the NDRRMC

• An initial team of DRRM System Administrators composed of people from at least DENR-

NAMRIA, DENR-MGB, DOST-PAGASA, and DOST-PHIVOLCS

Step N4.1: Build additional data warehouse features and plan for the facilitation

of data interface connections.

After settling on the technical requirements, changes to the governance responsibilities, changes to

the data management practices, and the development of GeoRiskPH’s additional features and needed

connectors can be worked on. A priority list of data sources to connect to should also be determined to

ensure seamless data migration during the latter part of the project. The exact details of the resulting

outputs shall depend on the previous step.

44

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Nonetheless, the expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

•

List of data interfaces with prioritization approved by DOST and validated by members of the

TWG

• Final list of user requirements validated by DRRM System Administrators that the developers on

the project will work on to connect the data interfaces to the data warehouse

Step N4.2: Create an implementation plan and allocate resources for capacity

building activities.

While the data warehouse itself is being prepared, the less technical aspects of the project should be

developed. Once the data warehouse itself is established, users who are part of the DRRM System

Administrators should be onboarded on how to use specific components of the platform and how to

maximize its features. Similarly, external data users like those from NGAs, LGUs, and the private sector

will need learning materials as documentation to educate themselves on utilizing the available data

interfaces.

The Pandas library’s documentation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

Climate Data Online documentation are some examples of good documentation.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• Human resource capacity building plan

• Documentation and learning materials of DRRM System Administrators and other platform

holders

• Resource allocation and budget approved by government representatives and funding agencies

45

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Step N5: Connect priority data interfaces and execute the capacity-building

campaigns.

The data warehouse infrastructure has been set up, and the needed capacity-building materials are

complete. Data migration from the previously identified data sources, which NGAs own, can proceed.

Enablement activities can be launched according to the current competencies of the NGAs’ staff, along

with the data migration. Otherwise, the documentation created in the previous step would suffice. This

step also includes the signing of the DSAs, a prerequisite to connecting data interfaces to the data

warehouse.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• Data interfaces connected to the data warehouse with signed documentation to be kept by both

the DRRM System administrators and the data interface owners

• Manpower of specific roles and responsibilities with the needed skills to sustain the data

interface connections

46

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Step N6: Support the LGUs’ capacity building activities.

Under the assumption that the NGA workstream will be completed faster than the LGU workstream,

the people who are now available can support the capacity-building activities in the LGU workstream.

This will increase the speed project given its broad scope. This workstream is discussed in the next

section. In the long term, perpetually ongoing support shall be given to the LGUs by the DRRM System

Administrators.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• A formal and standard avenue of communication between DRRM System Administrators and

LGUs finalized by the DRRM System Administrators

2.3.2. The Local Government Unit Workstream

Step L2: Establish exposure database guidelines based on the standardized

DRRM-CCA methodology.

After establishing standard methodologies and guidelines on how DRRM-CCA plans are created,

exposure database guidelines can then be created. This sequence is essential because the schema of

the exposure database relies on the needed data fields that are established in Step N1. The exact output

of Step N1 will also dictate the minimum required frequency of data updates and the resources necessary

to comply with reporting needs. Overall, the expected outputs of this step are the following:

• The bare minimum database schema and data fields necessary to create local DRRM-CCA plans

•

•

in accordance to the metrics and formulas defined in step N1;

the guidelines on data management practices; and,

the benchmark of the minimum resources requirements to develop and maintain exposure

databases.

47

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
• Exposure database guidelines containing at least the ff:

• Minimum schema necessary to create local DRRM-CCA plans

• Guidelines on data management practices

• Benchmark of the minimum resources requirements to develop and maintain exposure

databases

Step L3: Determine the baseline LGU resource capacities needed to follow the

established guidelines.

LGU’s resource capacities and baseline resource requirements should then be assessed to determine

the most cost-effective implementation strategy. These resources refer to equipment, infrastructure, and

human resource requirements needed by LGUs to participate and maintain the DRRM system. Considering

that the minimum requirements have been identified in Step L2 and that insufficient resources have been

determined, the approximate cost of the entire project could be estimated, and an operationalization

plan can be constructed.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• Operationalization plan for implementation approved and validated by DOST and their

development partners

Step L4: Create shared learning documents for LGUs.

From the results of the DGS, it was evident that resources in the form of human resource competencies

were lacking on the LGU’s side. This implies that knowledge transfer methodologies and materials

were insufficient to aid the LGUs contacted. Hence, learning materials similar to what was described in

Step N4.2 shall be created for the specific use of LGUs. These materials shall go hand-in-hand with the

capacity-building activities at the later stages of this workstream.

48

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• A defined set of published learning materials for LGUs that can be accessed both online and

offline

Step L5: Select a group of LGUs that will proceed with the project’s activities.

The simultaneous participation of LGUs in the project can outpace the ability of the project team to

capacitate the participants properly, so only a select number of units should be selected based on the

implementation strategy considerations.

This step and those following it shall be repeated until the minimum requirements have been rolled out

to all LGUs in the country.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• A defined list of LGUs and their contact details to engage with in order of prioritization

• Signed Memorandum of Understanding between implementing body and each LGU

Step L6: Provide the needed resources to a group of the LGUs.

The needs of each LGU shall vary and will be subject to constraints unique to the locality. As a result, the

execution of resource provision shall change. A certain degree of adaptability is needed to achieve the

objective of this step successfully.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• All LGUs of current selection are equipped with at least the baseline required resources

49

DRRM-CCA DIGITAL READINESS STRATEGY
Step L7: Launch a one-time capacity building activity for the group of LGUs.

This entire project and guideline might be new to many of the LGUs. The assumption that the local staff

know to operate with the guidelines alone could lead to an unsuccessful rollout of the system. To avoid

this, a one-time capacity-building campaign shall be launched for each group of LGUs who participate

in this project.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• At least a 90% attendance rate for each cluster of LGUs being trained

Step L8: Facilitate help desk access.

The DRRM-CCA space is dynamic. Changes will inevitably be required as each locality adapts to the

challenges at hand. At such a junction, the system in place, under the management of the DRRM System

Administrators, should adapt to the changes. The prerequisite to such adaptation are communication

and feedback with the end-user. In this instance, the end-users are the LGUs. Such is the reason why

a ‘help desk’ or a communications channel of similar nature between the LGUs and the DRRM System

Administrators should be available. The avenue connecting the two entities will ensure that changes

needed by the users are communicated directly to the providers of the data.

The expected outputs of this step of the project are as follows:

• All relevant members of the LGUs’ DRRM team has been registered or added into the DRRM

System Administrators’ preferred communication channel

• The communication line between each LGU should pass a series of basic connection tests
