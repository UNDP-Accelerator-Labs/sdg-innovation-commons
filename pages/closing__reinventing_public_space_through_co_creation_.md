## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Bissau-Guineans do not believe it is their responsibility to look after public spaces. 
2. Public spaces are necessary and there aren't enough spaces in the city. 
3. There is a lack of citizen ownership of public spaces and their maintenance. 
4. Public spaces are used for economic gains and activities. 
5. Public spaces lack amenities that inviting to citizens, i.e. water, shade, seating or bins.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. The main challenge was working with the Local Council. Due to political instability, after our first meeting and agreement on what to do next, we were informed that the government had removed all members of the council.  This meant we had to set up meetings and get buy in from a new team before moving forward. This caused a huge bottleneck for our test, and indeed we will have re-test our hypothesis.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose the methods above because due to the lack of research in the area of public spaces in Bissau, user led interviews which focus on their experience were more likely to give insights necessary for designing a test. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

To achieve sustainable urbanization one of the components is to ensure that we create livable cities for everyone. Public spaces need to be open and accessible to all citizens as these places have a deep potential of inspiring interactions and collectivism, promoting innovation and well-being, and at the same time strengthening local identity and our sense of a shared history. The absence of participatory practices often leads to situations where public spaces end up being underutilized or abandoned and degraded. The adoption of such practices has not yet been widely adopted in Guinea Bissau, although many actors are working to introduce the methodology.  Top-down approaches to planning and decision-making by local authorities generates poor and uncontextualized design and the current trend is that the gap between decision-makers and residents is getting bigger, leaving many citizens with a feeling of disempowerment. A bottom-up approach based on co-creation, tapping into historical memory, local knowledge, and skills, has the potential of improving design, function, local ownership, and sustainability in public spaces. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In the beginning of 2022, the Accelerator Lab Guinea Bissau started a learning experience focused on public space, in collaboration with the Municipality of  Bissau, UN Habitat, Lusófona University, and the Architecture School of KTH The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The collaboration is exploring different topics such as the possibility to open an Architecture education in Guinea Bissau to contextualize the build environment from a local and human centered approach, how academia can play a role in generating proposals to improve housing and public space and how maintenance issues can be tackled by a greater involvement of the citizens.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Blufu SARL, they provided knowledge regarding waste management and trends in the city. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Municipality of Bissau, the council were our main partners who granted us permission and information on how to move forward in relation to the test in the public space. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Blufu SARL, this company, is unusual because they work in the area of waste management but have never partnered with an organization developing projects for public good. They brought new perspectives and ways of seeing things in the area of public spaces, things that were not apparent to us, such as prompts and ways to get the public to use the public waste bins in a more sustainable manner. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UN Habitat, given their experience in the use of urban space, we created a partnership for knowledge sharing in order to improve public spaces in the city. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay and use of collective intelligence was invaluable in this learning cycle because we were able to bring together knowledge and experiences from different perspectives in order to make this test work.
