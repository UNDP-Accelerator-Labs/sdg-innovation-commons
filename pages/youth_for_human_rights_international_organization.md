Since the mission of the Organization worldwide is to advocate tolerance and peace, thus our vision is by 2030, whereas, we need to reach out to half of our country's population by mobilizing and sensitizing the same message to our fellow citizens starting with the youths so as to reduce corruption and GBV in communities, regions and the country at large.
