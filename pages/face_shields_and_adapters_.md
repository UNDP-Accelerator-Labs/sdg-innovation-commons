> Brief description about the identified local solution:

Because of the pandemic, the demand of ventilator devices has increased and here where the Ministry of Industry and Minerals took the initiative to respond through manufacturing Ventilator’s Adapters and 3D Face Shields. The Adaptors are for the purpose of connecting more than one patient on one ventilator device inside the hospitals, and it is one of the quick solutions that are used in the absence of access to the ventilators. The process of making these adaptors was done through using the 3D printers with specific features. These connections are an effective solution to reduce the load on the available ventilation devices. For example, 10 ventilator devices can cover 20 patients with these adapters. The adapters got the approval from the Ministry of Health – Nineveh Health Directorate and asked to provide them with these adapters. The same for the Face shields that made from 3D printers with international standards.
