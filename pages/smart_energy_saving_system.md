Common use spaces are usually areas of great energy waste. Faced with this reality that they had been observing in their own field of work, a team of researchers from the City of La Plata, province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, developed a smart energy saving system. It is a smart system capable of obtaining information on energy consumption in the different sectors of a building with the aim of carrying out actions to save energy.      This system was conceived based on Local Intelligent Processing Units (LIPUs) that control different rooms, using a set or network of sensors capable of capturing events in the room (presence of people, temperature, appliance connection, etc.), and based on a set of actuators to control electrical appliances. Each device allows to obtain data from different sensors and generate actions in a certain electronic device. On the other hand, the system facilitates the control of electrical components through relays and infrared waves emitters.
