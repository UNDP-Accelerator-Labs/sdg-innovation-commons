Wildlife Conservation and Science (WCS) Malaysia works to protect the habitats of orangutans, tigers, elephants, sharks and rays in Malaysia.  Through their project, “Empowering Orang Asli Jakun in Johor and Iban Communities in Sarawak towards Environmental Stewardship”, it empowers local communities via conservation education towards the survival of endangered animal species. The project focuses on the site's importance for remnant orangutan populations, elephants and tigers.   Solutions:  1. Connects communities with agencies for patrolling efforts by implementing an effective first line surveillance on the ground.   -A Siren fence system was introduced to solve Human-Elephant conflict. An early warning system will alarm the farmers when elephants try to enter their crop fields, reducing crop-raiding problems.  The siren fence consists of a thin, horizontal steel wire supported by wooden poles along the perimeter of the crop field. The alarm kit consists of a switch, car siren and 12 volt dry-lead acid battery attached to the wire which will trigger the siren when elephants come in touch with it.  Local communities are also able to operate GPS devices, satellite phones and digital cameras on their own though patrolling training. Allowances are given to participating patrols.

2. Pilot Eco-tourism program  - The eco-tourism program is a community-based eco-host project through nature education.  To ensure the program runs smoothly and materials as well as seminars can be conducted online, they introduced an Internet booster initiative that will help the community to participate. The success of this tourism plan will allow replication on other sites and promoting tourism at indigenous village sites.  3. Publishment of a folklore book entitled ‘Wildlife Tales and Iban Myths from Sabah and Gunung Lesong’ - The book consists of 21 folklore stories originally in Iban language and are translated into English language.  As of now, 200 copies of books are ready for distribution.   4. Radio program  - Poor phone and internet coverage in the villages lead to the hosting of a radio program consisting of 9 episodes of 3 minutes weekly. Radio program is one of the suitable ways in getting communication and information to learn and share knowledge.
