> Description of the solution

The NextGen Agroadvisory is a location-specific, tailored, and season-smart agricultural decision support tool (DST) designed to help farmers make informed decisions about fertilizer application, planting timelines, and other agricultural practices. The tool uses machine learning algorithms to analyze crop responses to different fertilizer inputs and spatial co-variants, providing recommendations tailored to specific locations and growing conditions.
