Lifting Gender Barriers to Build Food System Resilience

Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) such as Mauritius and Seychelles, continue to face hardships and vulnerabilities to external shocks in the aftermath of the pandemic and the ongoing global crisis. These traditional domestic markets are being significantly affected by the uncertain economic settings, which impact their access to food resources(link is external). With limited land resources, Mauritius and Seychelles must adopt novel sustainable agricultural pathways to achieve food system resilience targets and this also involves addressing barriers that limit women’s involvement in the agribusiness sector.Building the Food System ResilienceMauritius and Seychelles have traditionally relied heavily on food imports, with 77% and 90% of their food requirements being imported, respectively. This dependence on imports makes these countries extremely vulnerable to economic shocks and disruptions in food supply and prices. To achieve food system resilience, it is essential to assess and enhance domestic food production. Joint programs, such as the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) Mauritius & Seychelles' Joint SDG Fund Programme, have explored innovative solutions to support small farmers, fishers, and small and medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in building resilient food systems. These solutions include the use of seaweed as fertilizers and the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices such as aquaponics, hydroponics and sheltered farming. However, achieving island food resilience also requires the active participation of women entrepreneurs in the food value chain.

Women play a crucial role as key agents of change in agriculture, nutrition and development and their involvement can lead to more sustainable and regenerative food systems.
Women – The Silent Driving Force of the Agricultural Sector Globally, there are approximately 187 million women-owned enterprises(link is external), many of which are in the agricultural sector. In developing countries, women constitute 45% of the agricultural labour force, and this figure is rising to 60% in most parts of Africa and Asia. Despite their significant contributions and presence along the food value chain, women in agriculture face numerous challenges in accessing land, finance, resources, training and assets, limiting their contribution to food security. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) highlights that if women could reinvest up to 90% of their earnings back into their households, they could break the cycle of intergenerational poverty.

Challenges Faced by Women Entrepreneurs in the Agricultural SectorThrough the UNDP Accelerator Lab, the UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles has closely collaborated with local partners to explore the food system resilience. Adopting a sense-making approach, the team has identified five recurring challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector in SIDS:1. Securing Finance: Women entrepreneurs often struggle to secure finance, particularly due to a lack of collateral or credit history. Without adequate financial backing, women cannot invest in their businesses and expand their operations. Support and guidance are needed to help these entrepreneurs tap into diverse financial sources such as loans, grants, equity and crowdfunding(link is external).2. Access to Markets: Women-led enterprises face challenges in accessing markets. They require assistance and training to build market linkages and value chains that enhance their competitiveness and profitability. Connecting with other actors in the agribusiness sector, such as traders, processors, retailers and consumers, can help women increase their market share, diversify their products and services, and improve quality standards.3. Networking and Mentorship Opportunities: Women entrepreneurs lack networking and mentoring opportunities on small islands. Establishing relationships with successful women-led entrepreneurs can provide valuable information, insights and support. Women need new platforms and programs that facilitate networking and mentoring to access best practices and new opportunities.4. Community engagement plays a pivotal role for women entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector, particularly in small island networks. Beyond mere networking, engaging with local communities enables the development of social capital and facilitates access to crucial resources such as information, skills and opportunities. This connection cultivates a sense of ownership and responsibility within the community, instigating a drive to actively participate in decision-making processes and advocate for social change. Moreover, community engagement empowers women entrepreneurs by amplifying their voices and increasing their influence in decisions that impact both their lives and communities.5. In addition to community engagement, building resilience is of paramount importance for women entrepreneurs in small islands which encounter a multitude of challenges and pressures, including economic shocks, climate change and natural disasters. Developing resilience to overcome these obstacles is vital for the long-term survival and success of their agribusinesses.

Looking ahead, bridging the gender gap in the food system is essential for enhancing the resilience of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the face of climate change and economic shocks. Islands like Mauritius and Seychelles must prioritise strategies that dismantle barriers faced by women entrepreneurs in accessing finance, markets, technology, training and networks. Championing women entrepreneurs in agriculture, is not only about supporting their business aspirations, but also towards fostering a more balanced and sustainable world.
