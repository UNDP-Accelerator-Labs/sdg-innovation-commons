> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

100% involvement of Head of Exploration for 5 months, laboratory equipment supported by Pokhara Metropolitan City (PMC) Office which is worth USD 1,000 and technical backstopping by the technicians and engineers from the PMC Office for 3 months.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

If 1% of the non-recyclable waste can replace concrete in one brick then around 40,000 MLPs can be used in constructing 1 small rest-room, diverting the plastics from landfill sites.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We initiated the test for both hot and cold processes but had to stick to cold process only since chemical fumes were emitted while applying heat.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

5 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

around USD 6,500.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not yet

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

-

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1. There are requirements of local level guidelines and national policies to promote the potential of waste to energy and upcycling of plastic waste through recyclable and non-recyclable materials. 2. There are potential markets on waste enterprises but they require support on creating business model to promote waste upcycling business as a dignified enterprise. 3. There is a possibility of promoting Refused Derived Fuel in cement factory clinkers from the non-recyclable plastics. However, national approval and guidelines are essential. All our exploratory studies and test results on plastic bricks and Refused Derived Fuel have been submitted to the Department of Environment under Ministry of Forest and Environment to initiate the dialogue on creating feasible environment on bringing waste plastics into circular economy. 4. We explored the possibility of plastic mixed bricks and tested its viability in comparison to normal bricks. The compressibility test has been approved by the lab of Pokhara Metropolitan City office. As a result, a demonstration toilet was constructed from these bricks and handed over the lab of Metropolitan City. However, the cost is almost similar to normal bricks and it might be challenging for these bricks to compete with the already existing market. 5. There is a whole lot of exploration yet to be done on the effects of micro-plastics, especially after being upcycled. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The local governments are eager to work but reluctant to invest and test the idea at the same time. It took us lots of efforts and series of bilateral discussions to bring the LGs on board. Since the process was too time-consuming while bringing onboard local government formally through agreements, we partnered with the local organizations and private sectors to initiate the coordinating and mediating roles. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP projects within Environment Portfolio since there are few ongoing and upcoming programmes that is planning to incorporate green jobs, circular economy and waste recovery.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Local government and waste enterprises might benefit since this has high potential of minimizing plastic waste and at the same time creating new enterprises and generate employment.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. We did few iterations during the prototyping phase especially on the ratio of plastics to be mixed so that the compressibility test result is as per the national standard for normal bricks.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

To follow the national guidelines and ensure that it is approved by the government.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

It depends on the type of the waste

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This experiment is part of exploration and testing of the explored options together with the local government and private sector
