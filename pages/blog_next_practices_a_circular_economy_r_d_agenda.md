Circular Economy
An R&D agenda built
by UNDP and partners

Co-building the Accelerator Labs as a joint venture with:

UNDP
Core
Partners

Circular Economy

Covering 113 countries in the Global Majority,
including the majority of Least Developed
Countries and Small Island Developing States,
UNDP Accelerator Labs test, explore and create
new value for people and planet.

Through globally distributed research and
development (R&D), the UNDP Accelerator Labs
create value through experiments in hundreds of
countries in the Global Majority. Bottom-up R&D
means we map and learn from local experimentation
across many sectors to point to where there is tracti
on, what can be scaled and how innovation can
accelerate sustainable development.

What you will see in this document are
“next practices” for circular economies: R&D
activities ready to scale globally, future areas for
collaboration and a theory of change to drive
experimentation for SDG acceleration. Based on
patterns we see across Africa, Latin America,
Asia, Europe and beyond, these next practices
demonstrate how communities, businesses
and governments can work together to build
circular systems.

From Local Experiments to Global Value
UNDP’s innovation network, the Accelerator Labs,
has prototyped a new kind of R&D: learning from
signals of change to see patterns that create global
development intelligence. As we evolve into UNDP’s
open, globally distributed R&D capability, we’ve built
coalitions in three high potential niches to show new
ways to accelerate job creation, entrepreneurship
and sustainability: digital financial inclusion, food
systems and circular economies.

An R&D agenda for action
Circular Economy

Global circularity is in decline from 9.1% in 2018
to 7.2% in 2023—a 21% drop over the course of
five years. Municipal solid waste generation is
predicted to grow from 2.1 billion tons in 2023 to
3.8 billion tons by 2050.

Meanwhile, in just the past six years, we have
consumed over half a trillion tons of materials—
nearly as much as in the entirety of the 20th
century. If we persist on this trajectory, we will
require resources equivalent to nearly three Earth-
like planets by 2050.

Research shows that the circular economy could
unlock US$4.5 trillion in economic growth and
create 6 million jobs through activities such as
recycling, repair, remanufacturing and sharing.

Additionally, it could reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 6% to 7%, translating to cumulative
savings of 67 to 76 gigatons of CO2 equivalent
between 2026 and 2050. Also, less plastic waste
in the ocean would benefit industries like fishing
and tourism, as plastic pollution currently leads to
US$13 billion in costs and economic losses per year.

Circular Economy

R&D
theory of
change

The Labs’ R&D approach to circular econ-
omy positions waste as a key entry point
for driving transformative change. By
focusing on waste, we engage communi-
ties and local stakeholders in developing
solutions that create value from the
bottom up, by:

Weaving a Collective of diverse actors
to create ecosystem networks for col-
lective ownership of circular solutions
(seeing circularity).

Focusing on Incentives to encourage
the adoption of circular practices while
unpacking the disincentives that hinder
circularity (enabling circularity).

Connecting Grassroots to Policy by
linking community innovation and
grassroots solutions with policy makers
who are ready to drive systems change
(leveraging circularity).

This approach takes entry points in
immediate waste challenges to probe
systems by connecting our pro-
grammatic activities to the “middle
ground”—the enabling environment
of policies, infrastructure and market
mechanisms that support a circular
economy.

Positioning UNDP on
circular economy in
Pasig City, Philippines

In the Philippines, UNDP tackled Pasig
City’s growing plastic problem with a
systemic design approach, bringing
together local government, communities
and the private sector. A key achievement
was the establishment of the Innovation
for Circular Economy (ICE) Hub. Equipped
with waste processing and upcycling
machinery, this Hub empowers circular
entrepreneurship and the development of
local circular value chains. This experiment
has scaled from a single-city prototype
into an EU-funded Green Economy
Portfolio currently covering 20 cities and
local government units. Further expansion
is underway to 60 localities by 2028.

Citizen Science and
sustainable brick production,
Bihar India

To address pollution and labor rights
violations in the brick manufacturing
industry, UNDP India harnessed AI,
geospatial analysis and citizen science
to map over 47,000 brick kilns. This
initiative led to the inspection and green
transition of 1,000 kilns in Bihar, reducing
CO2 emissions by 500,000 tons annually
and supporting families in transitioning
to greener livelihoods. This experiment
brings together coordinated action
from diverse stakeholders—regulators,
government agencies, civil society and
volunteer groups to tackle inaction
on environmental commitments. The
platform demonstrates the value of
automated approaches for improving the
efficiency and scale of compliance moni-
toring efforts.

Circular Economy

Which indigenous
practices can we
bring back to support
circularity?

Many indigenous cultures have
long-standing traditions of sus-
tainable resource management
that align with circular econ-
omy principles. This R&D area
explores how these practices can
be integrated into modern circu-
lar systems, potentially offering
culturally appropriate, locally-
adapted solutions that enhance
resource efficiency, promote
biodiversity and strengthen com-
munity resilience in the transition
to a circular economy.

How to overcome
“trust” barriers
with multinational
corporations on data
sharing?

Data sharing is vital for opti-
mizing resource use and closing
material loops in a circular econ-
omy. However, corporations often
hesitate to share data due to com-
petitive concerns. This R&D area
seeks to identify strategies to
build trust and facilitate transpar-
ent information exchange, which
is essential for tracking material
flows, improving supply chain
efficiencies and fostering collab-
oration across sectors in circular
systems.

Understanding the waste life
cycle for decision making

Panama’s waste collection service currently
reaches only 65% of the population. To
address this gap, the Lab is employing
interactive workshops and data visualiza-
tion to better understand and engage with
waste management challenges. By leverag-
ing digital tools and GIS technology, the Lab
maps waste collection routes and visualizes
waste generation patterns. Mobile appli-
cations and online platforms are also used
to gather data and collect feedback from
the community. This digital-first approach
fosters collaboration between local com-
munities and policymakers, enabling them
to co-create solutions to the growing waste
problem. It also raises awareness about
recycling. For instance, in the San Felipe
Neri market, the Lab discovered that 99% of
food waste could be recycled.

Panama

Detecting waste hot spots

The Lab in Viet Nam took a two-pronged
approach to understand solid waste man-
agement in Da Nang City. First, they dove
deep into the informal waste sector, com-
bining participatory sensing, GIS mapping,
and interviews with informal workers. This
created a detailed map of the informal
waste management system, highlighting
its crucial role in the circular economy.
Second, the Lab conducted a pilot using
satellite imaging data and spectrum anal-
ysis to detect and map waste hotspots in
Da Nang City. This data provided valuable
insights for Da Nang’s waste manage-
ment strategies and its Circular Economy
Roadmap and showed potential for scale
in other urban environments striving for
sustainable waste management and a
circular economy.

Focusing on incentives...

This opportunity space explores the crucial role of
incentives and disincentives in shaping behaviors and
driving (or hindering) the adoption of circular practices.
It recognizes that while technological innovation and
infrastructure are essential, they are not enough to motivate
widespread change. We need to understand the complex
web of motivations and barriers that influence individual
businesses and collective choices. This could involve:

Designing and testing
innovative incentive
schemes: Developing and
piloting new incentive
mechanisms that are
tailored to specific contexts
and target specific
behaviors.

Evaluating the impact of
incentives: Assessing the
effectiveness of different
incentive schemes in driving
behavioral change and
achieving desired circular
economy outcomes.

Identifying and analyzing
existing incentives:
Exploring the effectiveness
of various incentive
mechanisms, such as
subsidies, tax breaks,
rebates, recognition
programs and how different
types of incentives influence
the adoption of specific
circular practices.

Unpacking disincentives:
Identifying and analyzing
the factors that discourage
or prevent the adoption of
circular practices. These
disincentives can be
economic, social, cultural, or
regulatory.

From Waste to Livelihoods

The Lab in Tanzania partnered with
Jubilee Insurance to create TakaBima,
a microinsurance product for informal
waste pickers. By delivering waste to
designated Waste Banks, pickers have
their contributions weighed and logged
into a digital system via mobile apps
and GIS technology. This waste data is
then tokenized to establish their credit-
worthiness allowing access to insurance
coverage for medical emergencies and
income loss. With over 10,000 waste
pickers estimated to be working in
Tanzania, this initiative has the potential
to significantly increase recycling rates
and provide financial inclusion and
social protection to informal workers.

Incentivizing waste sorting
in Indonesia

The Lab in Indonesia is tackling urban
waste management by mobilizing com-
munities through GRADASI, a behavioral
change campaign launched in part-
nership with various ministries and
faith-based organizations. Leveraging
the strong religious values in the
country, the Lab is promoting waste
sorting and recycling through places
of worship, incentivizing participation
by offering rewards and recognition
to those who actively contribute. Their
experiments show that combining
religious messaging with incentives can
significantly increase the number of
recyclables collected. To date, the cam-
paign has resulted in over 143,000 kg of
waste donated across various institu-
tions in 24 provinces, demonstrating
the potential of this approach to boost
urban resilience and promote circularity.
