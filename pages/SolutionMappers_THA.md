# Solutions Mapping for Inclusive Tourism in Thailand.

### [[0:02]] So can you tell me a little bit about yourself, your name, your position?

Hi, I'm Pattamon Rungchavalnot from the Accelerator Lab, Thailand\. I'm the head of solution mapping\.

### [[0:16]] Do I have consent for this interview?

I consent to give the interview\.

### [[0:21]] OK\. So you know this is about the open R&D toolkit that we're developing\. So we also wanted to do you have a, you know, given your experience being in this space for quite some time, do you have a story title for your for the for the the story that you're going to share with me today?

Definitely for the R&D story from the Accelerator Lab Thailand\. I would like to share about my work on inclusive tourism, particularly community based tourism for all the type of committee based tourism that can accommodate people from all backgrounds or physical and mental disabilities\. That is something that we have been working on in the past two years\. As you imagine that Thailand as you sorry if I, if I say something correctly, I just stop and start over again\.

### [[1:08]] No, you just keep on rolling\.

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Innovation management]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
Oh, OK\. But you edit it after that and I can cut it out\. So OK, as you may know, Thailand is very famous for tourism\. It's a very popular tourism destination\. So is the task of the lab to help the country rethink its tourism? How do we make tourism benefit more people, more local communities, beyond just the big businesses? And one of the things that we do is to help them tap into changing trends\. And if you look at the population trends of the world and, and in Thailand in particular, we have growing aging population\. So when we talk of inclusive tourism, people often think of people with disability only\. But if you really think about it, when we develop inclusive tourism for all, it's actually benefits so many other group of people, not only people with disability, but the elderly people that are coming with babies, families and so on\. So we're really trying to achieve the narrative on inclusive tourism to be a win for everyone in the country\.

### [[2:09]] Could you give me a little bit of profile on the, on the, the, the place where you've actually targeted where, where you're actually implementing this?

[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
Definitely\. So last year when we started this journey on inclusive tourism, we picked together with our government partner, the city of Sukhothai and Wuhan in Sukhandra province\. These two locations are very unique historical destination\. Sukhothai is actually one of the UNESCO World Heritage sites\. So it's popular touristic destination, but the local community there, they are helping to supply activities that are more community based and tap into the tourism market\. So we work with these two community to rethink how they can accommodate again, tourism from disability background as well\. So what are some of the tools and methods that you've actually used to use a part as a part of featuring in there for the tools we use Co creation approach as our main tools\. We bring in people with disability, the wheelchair user, the blind to Co create together with the local communities, the solutions that community themselves may not be thinking of at first\. Because when we talk about inclusive tourism, people are like, oh, it's going to require a lot of investment, going to be a lot of infrastructure development\. So they overlook the fact that inclusive tourism is actually a lot more about attitude and mindset and service skills as well, of course, along with the infrastructure\. So we try to develop this whole package together with people with disability themselves, rather than seeing them only as beneficiary, but shifting them to become the Co creator of the solution\. And we benefit so much from that because there are so many details that outside there like us might not be able to understand that say, for example, if you build access RAM and it's too steep, a few degree too steep and it's not become not usable by the user themselves\. So this is something that we need to engage the users, the people with disability to Co create together with the local community\.

### [[4:11]] So when you actually implementing, adopting or using those tools and methods, I'm sure there were some elements of surprise there\. So what are some of the tools or the methods that you sort of like developed yourself as a part of the journey?

[[tools:How might we]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
I think it's part of the co\-creation journey that they are twists and turns and things that I did not expect but came out\. I would like to give an example of the design of the RAM, the house or the venue owner that in the local community already tried to develop some ramp by himself because he see the importance of this, but it's way too steep\. So when we redesign it, we actually redesign it in the way that the length of the ramp is extended, but it goes to the back\. So the entrance have to be from the back\. But by engaging with the people with disability themselves, one of the team member who's the view share user raised the question\. So why do I have to go to the back to enter? That's really divisive\. If you want to be included, then we should make the main entrance, the front entrance an inclusive pathway for everyone\. So that's how we arrive at the final design and that's something that it's such a detail that I did not think of at first\. But through the co\-creation process, we are able to design the way that it's truly inclusive\. Another example that I think was really cool is the digital accessibility\. When you have a destination, you need to promote it online, right? You need to make this information accessible\. So the first thing that come to mind is usually new platform, new application, new website\. Of course, from the user perspective that is not friendly at all because they often times do not aware of this new application, new platform at all and it takes up space in that mobile phone and stuff\. So it's not really user friendly\. What they need is information on existing platform for things like Google Maps that everyone is already using\. Why can't we have information, evidence like photos, videos of how the venue look like? What are the activities being offered on those existing platforms? At the end we have a training for the local community to do shot clips, shot video clips, taking photos and upload onto Google Maps\. So that way it's an accessible solution for the real users\.

### [[6:19]] That's interesting\. I was also wondering when you're looking at inclusive tourism and you were engaging the, you know, the different sections of the society, particularly the presence with disabilities, were you also looking at them as service providers or also were you when you're looking at tourism, did you also look at, you know, how do you attract these different, you know, cohorts of, you know, users then?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
So that's actually something we learn along the way as well\. Last year when we started off, we see people with disability as co\-creator of the solution, reflecting the perspective of the tourists of the visitor who come as a client\. But as we work on this, we actually evolving our views that they should be the service provider as well\. So this year, as we continue our work in the different province, this year we'll be in some cloud province in the South\. We're actually looking for opportunities where people with disability can be served provider within the tourism sector\.

### [[7:10]] So I hear that what are the key tool or method that you use this co\-creation? So as a as a, you know, as someone who has actually implemented this with the community themselves, what do you think are some of the skills that you, you know, that is required of, you know, implementers like yourself?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
7:27  
I think the main skill is the communication and convening skill to bring together different stakeholder and really shape the narrative in a way that is a win win for everyone\. If the local community already have some interest, but they think, oh, it's too complicated, too much an investment to do this, then we have to show them that from the user perspective, these details matters and it needs to be done in the correct way up to the standard of say universal design and certain attitude that need to be in place\. So it's a win win for everyone\.

### [[7:58]] So you already went into that space with certain set of skills, but during the entire journey has there been new skills that you developed?

For NIL skills, I think it's the depth of the skills that we already have\. So we are quite familiar with all this convening coordination\. But with co\-creation, I think it's required the intensity of those skills and to be really patient to know that what the time, the extra time that we're taking the extra details that we did this we are discussing is making the difference when we go into this, you know, into this space, we do not sometimes necessarily have all the skills\.

### [[8:40]] So have there been, did you experience any skills gap, you know, in the process of this and you know, if you did, how did you actually manage to overcome those challenges gaps?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
In terms of gaps, I would not say skills per SE, but I think perspective of the market, that's something that we do not have and we cannot have because we are not the business sector\. So to close that gap, because it's really important for the community to develop inclusive tourism, they need to see that there is a market for it\. So to close that gap that UNDP as a development organization cannot provide, we cannot bring customer, we cannot bring tourism to the local community\. We really need to bring in the private sector\. In our case, we engage with the social enterprise that has been an early adopter, I would say has been engaging on inclusive tourism for the past seven years\. So they have received foreign, foreigner groups, people with disability that come to Thailand\. So by bringing this company in to develop together the solution with us and with the local community, with people with disability, they help to convince the local community that they have real experience welcoming this traveler with disability\. And the market is there\. If we can build trust of the traveler with disability, the market will come to you\. So I think that's the gap that we ourselves are not able to close\. But by bringing in partner from the private sector, from social enterprise that really help complete the picture\.

### [[10:05]] So when you first ventured into this, you know, inclusive tourism project, did you have very clear theory of change in the sense of like the results that you wanted to achieve? And were you able to, you know, while you were implementing it, were you able to achieve that? Or did you face some challenges like you, you know, mentioned around, you know, what you and DP can do and cannot do? So were there some challenges where you felt like, oh, you know, it's not really going as per, you know, what we intended to do? And did you have to, you know, what kind of agility and adaptiveness did you have to bring into to achieve the results that you were that you intended from the very beginning?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tools:Design]]
I would say we start up quite open\. We don't have like a fixed solution in mind\. We know that we want to do something to foster inclusive tourism in the community based tourism context\. And we recognize that the challenge is the attitude that people have regarding this type of tourism because it's usually require a lot of investment\. So we're going in trying to use co\-creation approach to change this mindset, bringing in people with disability to interact directly with the local community\. OK\. So I think I think it works out pretty well in the way that the Co creation approach is helping us to arrive at the solution that are needed based on the need of the users themselves\. So not much of a challenge there, but I think the challenge lies in the, the details of some solutions that from the perspective of the project team, we did not think that we could overcome that\. For example, certain activities in the community that we at first, we think it could not be transformed into inclusive tourism activity\. Like in Sukkotai, they have this traditional drawing of the, the fish, Sankalo fish that relies on watching the, the, the models and then following copying in the drawing\. So that's an activity that at first we think it's not possible to adjust, for example, blind people, how can we make this activity available for the, for the blind? So we sort of like, I personally gave up\. I thought, OK, let's leave out this activity is not doable, but through the power of co\-creation, the local communities, when they understand the concept, they actually keep on trying to think of the solution and innovating a way to create equipment\. Acrylic frame together with the clay jigsaw that make up the Sankalo fish that the blind can actually touch and draw according to the frame of the jigsaw and the acrylic frame\. So that's something that I think is a big surprise for the project team and myself\. That is something that we thought some activities might not be possible to transform into inclusive tourism activity\. But through co\-creation we witnessed the power of the local creation there\.

### [[12:58]] So what do you think you know, now that you reflect back on the journey, what are some of the principles do you think really helped you take this work forward?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
I think the principle that is really key here is the belief in collective intelligence\. To not think that we have all the answers, but we try to bring people who are the key stakeholders in this issue to work together and look at it from different perspective\. From the user perspective, meaning the tourist perspective is really important because they are the end users\. But from the local community also very important because this is where we want the benefit to happen, right? Tourism come, the local community should benefit\. So it has to be something that they're comfortable with and they are agree upon\. To develop perspective of the private sector, the company, the tour agency that bring in the tourist, also important\. The government agency that has to scale this work forward also important\. So I think collective intelligence is the heart of this work\.

### [[13:54]] You shared a lot of rich insights in terms of, you know, the learnings from the field, you know, when you were in the due process of implementation\. So I just wanted to hear more in terms of, you know, you said you implemented it in two communities\. So how did you, you know, what was the plan in terms of diffusing it to, you know, for making this more catalytic and scaling up?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
I think the two community that we work with serve as the pilot area and to show people that it's not impossible even when we work in the community context, that resource are so limited\. But with the new mindset, with the new attitude and understanding, we can do so much\. And I think this is the knowledge product that we are able to share with other communities, with the government agencies\. So this is the reason why this year we are moving to a different province, the Song Cloud province in the South and working up to the next level\. So last year was community level\. This year we're trying to elevate to the city level\. So Sokha Old Town is the target area for this year\. Implementation on tourism for all, not only the local community, but ecosystem in the town\. Restaurant, accommodation, guest house, souvenir shop, they all have to buy into this idea of inclusive tourism development\.

### [[15:08]] Oh, that's very impressive\. So thank you very much for your time and for sharing the very rich insights on the project\.

Thank you so much\.
