## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Zandile Mthembu

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

9 May 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Digital transformation 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

This activity responds to challenge that Judicial systems in Eswatini are non-digitization. Within the judicial ecosystem, this leads to: 1. Overcrowded remand facilities and inadequate resources to accommodate inmates. 2. Challenges in

providing legal aid promptly 3. high expenses in transportation and security to transport detained persons weekly to appear before the magistrate for sessions that can be as short as 10minutes, in the period awaiting trail. 4. During covid, this manual procedure limited access to justice particularly for the vulnerable . 

In UNDP Eswatini, Governance is one of programme pillars in the CPD (2021-2025). The programmes under this pillar look at strengthening governance systems particularly within the judiciary. Government duty bearers are capacitated to better provide efficient services that improves access to justice. Digitalization has been identified as a catalyst or an enabler and as such, the governance portfolio has identified the establishment of an Electronic Case Management System (ECMS) as central to the improvement of access to justice. The system has a multifunctionality that cuts across all departments of the Judiciary, including courts. For example; during the Covid19 lockdown period, courts had to grind to a halt, the consequence of this this was a backlog and inefficiencies in remanding offenders.  The need for electronic systems unlock the inefficiencies and to speed up the trials of alleged offenders became apparent than ever before.   

The background of the challenge is that Eswatini courts were still using ‘traditional’ and manual methods of managing cases including remanding.  Remands in the case of Eswatini refers to detention of individuals who are awaiting trial or court proceedings. These individuals are held in custody during the pretrial phase, either because they are considered a flight risk, a danger to society, or to ensure their appearance in court. Defendant is expected to appear before presiding officers on a weekly or biweekly basis. The appearance before the judge is to be maintained by the defendant through the period of pre-trial and through the remand phase. This requires physical transportation of held person throughout the process for a session that can can last approximately only 5 to 15 minutes. The nature of remote remanding  allows for the efficient appearance of held persons remotely, a cost saving measure and also helps to observe COVID 19 regulations.

Addressing this frontier challenge was very much in line with the UNDP Eswatini 2021 – 2025 CPD where UNDP aims to ‘support the deployment of innovative digital solutions to specific areas of fiscal management, aid coordination, regional integration and strengthening of regulatory functions’.  To enhance government efficiencies, UNDP will support the deployment of innovative digital solutions to specific areas of fiscal management, aid coordination, regional integration and strengthening of regulatory functions. Through the Accelerator Lab, UNDP will support and promote the use of innovative digital solutions to enhance efficiencies.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Does digital transformation play a role in improving efficiency in judicial processes and increase access to justice?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a digital system is put in place in the remanding ecosystem, then remanding procedures would be more efficient and cost effective.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The hypothesis was tested by:

1. Procurement, Installation and testing of virtual courts equipment

Remote remand site inspections were conducted to take stock of equipment required for setting up the systems. The system was already set up, but over the years some equipment items had been obsolete. The supplier then installed and commission the system in collaboration with Judiciary and correctional services IT teams. Items required were:

- Video Conferencing Systems and cabling

-  testing of microwave links transmission systems.

- installation, configuration and commissioning of server room

2. Drafting and review of Virtual remand Practice directive

Held extensive consultations with the office of the Chief Justice of Eswatini. He endorsed the set up of a team to support the activity of drafting procedures (practice directive). In English law, a practice direction is a supplemental protocol to rules of civil and criminal procedure in the courts – "a device to regulate minor procedural matters" – and is "an official announcement by the court laying down rules as to how it should function." This document was key in the experiment as it provided guidance on the virtual remands protocols for the digitalization of the remands experiment. The judiciary team  supported in the roll out and monitoring of the directive so that any changes that need to be considered are communicated to the relevant structures.

3. The judiciary and correctional services teams were consulted to design the experiment activities. And the Human rights commission was engaged to ensure no rights of held persons are infringed during this digitalisation transformative activity. The teams supported in providing a roaster of cases that can be remanded virtually during  experiment period. The IT team in the high court was also participating in supporting with technical issues, and taking record of the use of the system.   

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis, is: Qualitative data ;consulting with the officers to confirm the use, pros and cons of the system. Quantitative data; record from the IT team on the dates and times in which the systems was used. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data collection technique was:

1. Holding biweekly catch up meetings with the judiciary colleagues in both the high court and remand centers to share observations of the experiment.

2. Data from the IT backend system recorded the duration and use of system.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

18months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

$15000
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

we had a research question that said: Does digital transformation play a role in improving efficiency in judicial processes and increase access to justice?

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology was fit for purpose. The experiment was long enough for us to be able to make changes along the way. On the the changes we made was the data collection tool which was a questionnaire that was to be filled by the clerks for every virtual remand sessions. This did not work and we changed to using focused interviews with the core team at the High court and remand centers. For data, we used the system reports instead of manual records.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

It took us 18months. 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Monetary expenditure was mainly for the equipment purchased to complement the existing virtual remanding system that had been previously donated to government of Eswatini. However over the year the infrastructure got damaged and the lab supported in resuscitating it for the experiment. Approximately $10 000, was used. 

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes,. After the experiment was closed the team is still in touch with the focal persons in the judiciary to follow up on the growth phase of the experiment. The colleagues have confirmed that a new remote remand site has been commissioned. From the learnings of the experiment conducted in the capital city, the judiciary is not duplicating it in Manzini (the most populated remand center).

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The experiment has scaled up on its own without the push of pull from UNDP. Government judiciary is scaling it post the learnings of the experiment starting from early this year.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> None

NA

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Systems thinking is key in transformative initiatives. This experiment took some time to set up. This was mostly due to the delicate and highly political delegations that we had to meet to get permissions and support to conduct the experiment. There were several external factors that also occured during the period i.e. covid 19 lockdowns, Civil unrest an the incarceration of political figures in the country. We were unable to work out loud about the experiment due to the sensitivities brought by the political climate in the country.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The challenges were getting buy in from high officers in government, getting appointments to meet them and finding the right suppliers for the equipment.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Governance unit. They can add this work to the results and further resource mobilisations for similar initiatives. This experiment was reported in their results outcome and further enhanced their value offer to government.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The correctional services, courts, magistrate. They can now monitor the proceedings occurring at the courts virtually, the government now has results and proper working equipment to confidently scale this work knowing that it does work.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. Data collection tools and method had to be adjusted to reduce the amount of paperwork that the clerks complete per session. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

This is not an easy and short experiment. It took us almost 2 years to design, set up and test. Political will and support is key yet not so easy to achieve. Its also a very ethically sensitive experiment as the persons held are a key participant that doesnt have too much lee-way to comment or express their views adequately remotely about the system and other sensitive issues they may wish to share with the judge in the court.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

No

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

with the Explorer - i could have conducted more research on government's progress on implementing such as system. We learnt during the experiment that vital equipment was procured by another donor, but got lost. The security and sustainable use of the equipment is still a concern as it seems the security does get compromised.  

Solutions mapper - I believe that there are other alternative solutions out there that can be tested to achieve the same outcomes. 

> What surprised you?

What surprised me was the ease to adopt the virtual system once it was up and running. The technicians reported 100% efficiency and no technical glitches.
