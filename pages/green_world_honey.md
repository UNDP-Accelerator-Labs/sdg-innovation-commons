> Brief description of the innovation

Green World Honey is a non-governmental initiative based in Kabompo district of Northwestern province in Zambia.
 It is premised on the (3PM) model-produce,procure,promote and market organic honey.
 Production of this organic honey is done using a natural environment sustainable approach(Top Bar Hives) as opposed to Back Hives,no cutting down of trees.  This is because bees needs flowers from  trees to make honey.
Our target markets are local supermarkets in Zambia,South Africa and China where this product has insatiable demand. 
When fully developed,the project will provide employment opportunities to more than 10 youths.
Honey is not only nutritional but medicinal and a substitute of chemically based sugar.

In summary Green World Honey will promote good health, sustain natural environment provide employment and contribute to economic growth of  the national GDP through its exports and maintain  natural environment for sustainable development.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Green World Honey will generate a projected income of more than K300 000 per season. This is due high demand of natural and organic both locally and internationally.
Locally one tonne of processed honey is fetching not less than K60 000.This project is capable of producing more than 5 tonnes is a single season. 
Kabompo has two honey seasons. The first one starts in May-July and the other one from Late October - December. 
Organic honey now sells like hot cake and slowly it is assuming a new name "Liquid Gold".The bye-products of honey are also used to make wax and local beer, making it a viable money spinning activity. 
Being a substitute for sugar, honey is now fetching a comparative high price than sugar per kg and it's slowly gaining a large market share in the food industry.
If scaled up, this project can have a positive ripple effect of promoting rural industrialisation which will translate into job opportunities for many youths and contribute to economic growth.

> Technical Feasibility

This project is doable.It can kick start with a start up capital of K100 000.This money can be used in the initial stage of procuring plastic containers and distribution to the prospective honey farmers whom we have already identified. 
The next stage will be acquiring a pickup van to help in the collection of the comb honey from the outskirts of rural Kabompo where most honey farmers are premised.
After doing a market research,it is found that 
Organic comb  honey in Kabompo is costing K15 per kg and when processed it fetches a much higher value per kg of not less than K50 giving a profit margin of more than 100% excluding other logistical expenses which can actually be controlled and brought to a minimal level. 
Organic honey is selling very well over the counter in many small retail outlets in Kabompo and has potential to sell in bigger supermarkets in towns if produced and supplied in large quantities.
Already we have alot of middlemen traders with pending contracts of supplying organic honey to shopping malls within Zambia but we lack capacity to supply this product at optimum level due to financial constraints.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Socially, this project will impact the society positively especially in terms of improving the standard of living of the local people around the immediate environment where the project is located. 
Many honey farmers will be empowered financially and will be able to fend and provide neccesities for their families. They will afford accessing quality health care, take their children to schools and afford to acquire some basic utilities that improves human stay. 
Honey products have a variety of utility.Its is used for making wax which industries require for manufacturing of candles and other products and as well locally the bye product of honey  is used for making a local beer brand commonly known as "kasolu".Honey beer has two advantages.It is not only low in alcohol content but also improves the immunity system of those who partake it. In short it is both liquor and medicinal at the same time. 
All these above are income generating activities that honey production can and is already providing.
