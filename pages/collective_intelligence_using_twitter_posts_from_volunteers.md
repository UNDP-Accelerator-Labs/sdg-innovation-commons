## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The learning intents from this

activity are twofold. On the one hand, building on the capacity developed

earlier to analyze conversations in social media around a hashtag, we wanted to

test the concept of using twitter to generate collective intelligence with the

help of volunteer organizations. On the other hand, from the collective

intelligence generated we want to learn in which ways people see that it's

possible to improve wellbeing and at the same time protect nature.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we volunteers collect data

about nature-based solutions in twitter, THEN we can use data analysis

techniques to generate collective intelligence. 



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Before launching the project, a

brief proposal explaining the challenge was written and sent to the

environmental program officer in the UNDP country office to validate. Then we

reached out to our strategic partner in civil society (Centro de Voluntariado Guatemalteco), requesting their collaboration. CVG helped recruiting

volunteers, and we ran an initial pilot to test the instructions to participate

through a WhatsApp group. With this, we refined the instructions and launched

an open social media campaign with the hashtag #DesarrolloConNaturaleza, which

was led by volunteers and requested people to post photos of examples of things

that help improve people's economic and social wellbeing and at the same time

protect or repair damage in nature. Data was monitored daily from the Twitter

API using the software R. We ran a couple of complementary workshops with

volunteers to increase the content generated. Afterwards, we used ShinyApps.io

to publish a library of the data collected.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

There are two levels of analysis, the campaign as a whole, and the individual tweets generated. 



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We collected data from the Twitter API



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

About a month



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

To run the experiments, we need

expertise in the collection and analysis of social media data. Also, we used

the open-source software R. We also needed time to organize the workshops with

volunteers, and time to collect the observations. All the exchanges were done

remotely so we needed Zoom and Mural to coordinate. We also needed Twitter

accounts and a Twitter developer account to set up the API communication.


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partially proven



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It was difficult to gain access

to the location of the posts, because of user's privacy. Using text within the

tweet makes it easier to parse and analyze later, but it can be messy, with

errors, and requires training. Young people in Guatemala are less enthusiastic

about the use of Twitter. It is the easiest platform for data analysis in terms

of accessibility. However, people prefer Instagram or Tik Tok for sharing

content.



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

About a month



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

No additional costs to normal operations. Nothing was needed to be procured or bought as we used open source data and software. 



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. The next stage is to transfer the capacity to use these tools. However, it has proven difficult to implement due to lack of people with required skills. 



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. It is planned that collective intelligence methodologies using social media data be scales to other topics within the country office. 



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

- This experiment led to partnerships
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

There were many learnings from

this activity. Regarding nature-based solutions, we identified several themes

where grassroots solutions are abundant: (1) waste management including

plastics; (2) production and consumption; (3) tourism; (4) community projects;

(5) mobilization; (6) environmental protection; (7) food; (8) household habits;

(9) sharing time with others; (10) use of water. We also learned that Twitter

is a viable way to generate collective intelligence using citizen generated data,

although Twitter is not the preferred platform for users. We also learned that

showing that something works is not enough to transfer capacity, because people

see a product, they are interested in not with the intention of doing it

themselves, but something to be done for them.



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Several challenges. Some included that it's not easy to gain access to location data from twitter (as it's not default). Also, Twitter is not the preferred platform for young people in Guatemala. Moreover, it's difficult to find people with the technical skills to replicate the exercise. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All the programmatic areas within

the country office, as well as the strategic unit. Social media data is an

abundant source of citizen-generated data that can help understand perspectives

from the conversations of everyday people, and this can be considered for

making decisions.



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Volunteer organizations that want

to generate collective intelligence, as well as other civil society

organizations. Government agencies that are looking for low-cost ways to learn

from the perspectives of citizens. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

This was the second iteration to develop the social media analysis, now it included some automations and public access to analysis in (close to) real time. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

See if there are conditions to use instagram, try to get location data turned on by users, be aware that it requires technical skills to access social media data. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely, it's mostly a test on a methodology that is agnostic topic-wise. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense helped narrow down the topic to nature-based solutions, exploration initiated the interest in the use of social media data as a source of information. 



> What surprised you?

There is a large demand to take

advantage of social media data, but projects are not looking for in house

solutions but rather readymade commercial services that can be purchased.

Capacity building within projects is difficult, because people are recruited

with product-oriented responsibilities, rather than for problem solving skills.

Waste management is one of the most accessible ways to improve economic and

social wellbeing, when at the same time protection or repairing damage on

nature.
