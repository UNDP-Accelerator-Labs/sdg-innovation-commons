How to use more natural light and less artificial light in interior spaces? This question was the trigger that planted an idea in three young people, a 17-year-old student and two 18-year-old boys. As a solution to the problem of electricity consumption, a prototype was developed that "captures" sunlight and transmits it to an interior space, prioritizing natural and ecological-sustainable energy.    The prototype is an interior lighting system that captures and transports sunlight to closed and dimly lit environments. It does not consume electricity, which makes it friendly to the environment and represents a reduction in energy costs. The system consists of three stages. A solar tracker measures the angle of incidence of light on the platform. With this signal, it controls two engines that manage to direct the base in both axes until it is perpendicular to the incidence of the sun. This system manages to track the sun throughout the day just like sunflower plants do. Then a lens on the oriented platform focuses the solar radiation at a point where the entrance of an optical fiber (Core) is located. This circuit can be replicated as many times as necessary depending on the lighting required. Finally, the light concentrated thanks to the collector is transmitted through the fiber towards the environment to be illuminated. At the fiber optic outlet, a diffuser is placed, responsible for distributing the light evenly.
