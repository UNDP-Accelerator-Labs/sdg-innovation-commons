## Overall goal

Jointly monitor the air quality with students and teachers from Buenos Aires primary and secondary schools in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and analyze the differences between the communes of Buenos Aires. 
## Description of citizen participation

Students and teachers from Buenos Aires primary and secondary schools measure the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air using diffusion tubes installed in schools. The participants observe the same protocol, and the teachers were trained by the professionals of Instituto de Química, Física de los Materiales, Medio Ambiente y Energía (INQUIMAE, by its Spanish acronym) [Institute of Chemistry, Materials Physics, Environment, and Energy] to appropriately place and take samples. The analysis is carried out in specific meetings organized in the form of a workshop in which students, teachers, and professional researchers participate. As a result of these workshops, proposals for each commune will be co-designed. 

Diffusion tubes are installed in schools selected from 50 sampling points, and at least four measurement campaigns are conducted per year, one per season. In each campaign, the tubes remain installed for 21 days, which provides an aggregate measurement of vehicular air pollution, in addition to the dose received by an individual during that time.
