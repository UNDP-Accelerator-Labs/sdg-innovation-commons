## Title

SMEs Growth and Resilience
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in times of uncertainty and pandemic shocks, we see that Serbian economy and society need a future-proof and resilient SMEs sector for further sustainable human and economic development in Serbia. With already established many players and stakeholders in the field of the SMEs, we want to explore potential approaches, solutions, partnerships and insights that can inform SMEs portfolio design and help position UNDP in this field.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As witnesses of the COVID-19, we see that this pandemic has exacerbated Serbia’s private sector challenges, whereby many businesses have drastically reduced their productivity, and more than 90 percent of Serbia’s businesses are expecting difficulties in covering liabilities. To overcome these challenges and to prepare for emerging trends in the future of work, climate change, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Serbia requires robust structural reforms and innovation. This includes fostering a reskilled and more fluid labor market, improving access to finance and the ease of doing business, and encouraging private sector-led export growth beyond domestic consumption.​​In addition, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which account for four percent of businesses but 35 percent of national employment and gross value added, should be at the forefront of such efforts. In addition, recent data indicates that challenges related to COVID-19 continue for SMEs, with 75% of SMEs reporting lower revenue than expected in 2020, and only 3% of SMEs reporting higher than expected revenue (UN COVID-19 SEIA, 2020).​ These trends show us where weak points could be found, but also, give us signals where opportunities for SMEs resilience and further growth might be - eCommerce as a potential solution for business and market expansion as well as generators of additional business streams. As stated in our Lab learning cycle closing for 2020/202, during our Innovation Facility work with Chora, the Accelerator Lab has designed a problem space around future-proof work to induce 3 system wide effects (Adaptive Human Capital, Agile Public Policies and institutions and Future-Proof Private Sector). In the later stage, we narrowed down the topic and continued our work with Deloitte on building a portfolio on future-proof private sector and creation of an enabling environment for SME sector growth, resilience, and innovation in a rapidly changing world. First draft of the new UNDP Serbia SMEs portfolio has been created and now we are in the stage of validation and further exploration of possible solutions. To date, the Accelerator Lab has engaged with Deloitte and a CO team on overall portfolio design, as well as leading a stream of work around e-commerce as an element in the SME resilience space that has become particularly relevant with Covid-19.

Quantitative: Projected eCommerce market user penetration in Serbia will be 52.7% in 2021 and is expected to hit 61.4% by 2025.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

While SME development is a traditional development area, UNDP in Serbia has had very limited experience working in the field. Emphasizing the “future-readiness” of the sector (in light of Covid-19 especially) potentially calls for a new understanding of the entire private sector resilience space, stepping out of the CO’s comfort zone and engaging with unusual partners. This portfolio is seen as “nested” within the depopulation portfolio, which has been led by the Accelerator Lab.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

By using innovative approaches and alternative data, we want to support serbian ​SMEs to be at the frontier of technological and green transformation that accelerate sustainable human and economic development in Serbia.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we build a coherent portfolio for Serbian SMEs growth and resilience?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

System Thinking - bearing in mind that we are currently in the phase of exploration, we see system thinking as a core methodology necessary for dealing with complex issues.   Solutions Mapping - through our work, we have applied solutions mapping methods in order to identify what’s the current state in the field of SMEs resilience and growth but also to understand what are the emerging trends in some other economies and environments.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Customer research and market research data gaps can be filled using new/alternative datasets (such as social network/media data, open data, etc.). In addition, new data sources can also boost customer outreach marketing.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

 How might we support further growth of eCommerce in Serbia?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation - to join the efforts, knowledge and experience from different stakeholders and industry players in order to validate ideas, approaches, and potential partners, as well as to gather valuable feedback for further adaptation of the set of potential solutions.  Human-centred Design - through design thinking workshops with SMEs we want to use this methodology to create potential solutions that are made based on real users’ needs.   Positive Deviance - to learn from those groups who have already “hacked” the system and created shortcuts (e.g. successful digital-born companies who are operating in the eCommerce environment). We want to use a positive deviance approach for further exploration of potential solutions and approaches

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Most of the existing data is based on the official statistics or other quantitative sources such as reports on financial transactions by the commercial banks, credit card issuers or the Central Bank. Through more in-depth research we aim to paint a much more nuanced picture of the ecosystem and its pressing issues
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Immediate beneficiaries include Serbia CO and colleagues working on design of SMEs portfolio. This includes our CO colleagues as we are planning to use our findings from the eCommerce study and further inform and shape our newly established SMEs portfolio.
