DEMONSTRABLE VIRTUAL TEACHING OF SCIENCE EDUCATION - TO HELP TEACH ABSTRACT CONCEPTS OF SCIENCE AS THOUGH IT WERE IN THE LABORATORY

> Brief description of the innovation

The title of my innovation is "DEMONSTRABLE VIRTUAL TEACHING OF SCIENCE EDUCATION - TO HELP TEACH ABSTRACT CONCEPTS OF SCIENCE AS THOUGH IT WERE IN THE LABORATORY". As the title suggests, this innovation is for the ministry of education and it is aimed at making the teaching and learning of scientific phenomenon understandable even in the remotest area of the nation where laboratory and apparatus are not available for the proper teaching of science. So this innovation comprises of virtual teacher and virtual experiment presented in form of PowerPoint or video. So the individual who is going to use this innovation is just going to watch the presentation and be able to understand the concept. This is because, there visual presentations of experiment which are done in such a way that the teachers and learners are going to be stimulated to the new way of learning science.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation is given in the description above, it is going to improve the delivery of science education in Zambia and its going to affect the performance of education in a positive way. The reason why i say so is because teaching shall no longer be confined in a classroom situation only. This is because these video presentation of science lessons shall be posted on educational portals which shall be made accessible to all Zambians. In the area of GCE (general certificate of education), student undergoing GCE examinations shall find such an innovation helpful because they will be able to learn and understand science phenomenon anywhere else provided there is internet. 
In a nutshell, the overall performance of education shall be improved and it shall bring a new paradigm shift in the way we deliver science education. All in all this innovation does not stand as a teacher replacement but a consolidation of the science education in schools.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed in such a way that, it brings almost all science practicals performed as if they were being performed in a real world. It uses PowerPoint 2019 which comes with 3D images. There is also a voice over and an image of a teacher explaining every part of the concepts. Whenever experimented are needed, the animated experiments have been incorporated hand in hand with notes and voice over from the teacher explaining every concept. So this brings in the need of a teacher, the need of notes and the need of experiments all in one package with such easy.
The prototype of this innovation exist like in online teaching courses. However, the different with those online is that this innovation targets specifically the Zambian education curriculum. It incorporates all the concepts and experiments as outlined in the science syllabus.  
So this innovation is proposed to be implemented by way of using smartphones as platforms on which such an innovations can be accessed and as stated earlier, this innovation is proposed to under ministry of education. It is proposed that the ministry of education is supposed create a national education resource portal for free science education resources where everybody who has access to the internet can go and download or watch the presentations. Apart from that, it is proposed that such an innovation should be distributed in all schools alongside smart TV screens where teachers can view the presentations to the learners especially in areas where certain science practical experiments cannot be performed.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can improve the lives of others because they are going to find it easy to assimilate science concepts and this is going to affect their pass rate and progression to higher levels of education. In should, this will help people attain their education goals.
