## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn what role academia can play when it comes to develop innovative, participatory and viable proposals for public spaces.  The KTH architecture students spendt time in the public space of Alândega together with the environmental students form the local Lusófona University, interviewing users of the public space on their perceptions, needs and ideas for improvement. Together with the Design Thinking interviews conducted by the Lab with focus on the same topic, this laid the basis for the student proposals of how to re-think and improve the public space of Alfândega.    Data will be collected by comparing the student proposals in terms of innovation and contextuality, with existing ideas and proposals normally developed by the Bissau Town Hall.  

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H2. “ IF… academia is involved and students are allowed to create proposals of how to improve public spaces, THEN… more innovative and viable proposals will be developed” 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Data will be collected by comparing the student proposals in terms of innovation and contextuality, with existing ideas and proposals normally developed by the Bissau Town Hall.  

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Accelerator Lab and Bissau Town Hall

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

> What is the estimated sample size?

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

2 weeks from the Lab, KTH School of Archutecture got an Erasmus + grant which supported the students with a part of the expenses of the trip
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

N/A

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months beacuse the students needed time to develop their proposals 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

From our side 0 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, we are planing to impliments one of the student´s proposal together with Bissau Town Hall

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, possibly with Bissau Town Hall. 

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1. Academia has the potential to play a role when it comes to developing innovative, viable and sustainable proposals: Comparing the student proposals in terms of innovation and contextuality, with existing ideas and proposals developed by the Bissau Town Hall, it is clear that academia has the potential to play a role when it comes to developing innovative, viable and sustainable proposals for public spaces. 

2. Language barriers are always present when working with participatory methods in an international team, but these barriers can be overcome tapping into sources of bi-lingual team members

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Political instability during the experiment where the main team of the Bissau Town Hall was exchanged, it is now a challenge to build up a new relationship of trust and see how we can continue to work together. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All clusters because it demonstrates the potential of working closley with academia. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministries and the Town Hall because it shows how they can continue to use storytelling and nudging to create behavioral change.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Not at this stage.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Make sure you create close relationships with the Municipality and the national and international partners. To ensure scalability and continuation of initiatives, it is crucial to work closely with the other programmes inside UNDP and well as building on their existing relationships with national partners. We did not work with any of the clusters in this ativity, making the continuation and scalability of this activity unsure.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, I believe it can be replicated in almost any of the other SDGs. Bringing in students as Think-Tanks has proven to be a viable way to generate new ideas and solutions around development challenges.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The team was trying to optimize time working on multiple learning cycles during the same time. Next time I would like to work closer with the Solution Mapper and Explorer for a deeper and more dynamic process.

> What surprised you?

How fun this activity was and how much potential the student´s ideas really had!
