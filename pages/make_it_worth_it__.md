This innovation is going to help street kids as they can be involved in obtaining there materials instead of just always asking ,they stand a chance to have a decent income and also increase job availability for those passionate about recycling ,and those that make good mediators and sales person's.

> Technical Feasibility

I do not have a prototype per say as at now ,but,the implementation plan is such that as long as the matrials are made available together with the materials used to make cement,all that is needed is a machine to shred the bottles,a mixer machine to combine the two , knowledge of what proportions should be added and ideas on what should be made.
