Circular Economy- Optimising private sector investment in Mauritius
OCTOBER 17, 2021
This report is the product of a partnership between Business Mauritius and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with financial support from the Government of Japan as part of efforts to facilitate the socio-economic response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in Mauritius.
The successful implementation of the Circular Economy will require an integrated approach that coordinates the efforts of all stakeholders in collaboration with the private sector. We are hopeful that the insights contained in this report will be a useful guide for policymakers and actors in the private sector.
