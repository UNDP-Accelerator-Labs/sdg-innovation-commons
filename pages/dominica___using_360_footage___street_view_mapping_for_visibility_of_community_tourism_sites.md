## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

30th May 2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Innovative technology in Tourism 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Various establishments in Dominica are based on Tourism. Dominica has attractions such as hot springs and other areas which are located outside of the central area. This therefore means the tourist would need to be able to find these locations. Unfortunately, some roads were damaged after the passage of hurricanes and Google Maps does not sure the paths to these establishments. This therefore means that such businesses could loose income and tourist could miss out on the attractions Dominica has to offer.

Community and heritage tourism plays a key role in Dominica. Many sites such as Indian River and Cabrits are key parts of the history of Dominica. However, there are tourist who prefer to visit sites on their own may find it difficult to navigate. Such occurrences may be a result of incomplete Google Map routes to the location and limited knowledge on the significance of some of these areas.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can 360 cameras be used to determine the roads which are missing from Google.

Can the missing roads be uploaded using Google Street View (GSV) and be used as a guide for tourist to access these locations?

Can the addition of missing roads using Google Street View (GSV) be used to increase the visibility of community tourism sites?

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

360 mapping and Google Street view along with digital signage and Kiosk can be used to increase visibility of remote community tourism sites.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If Kiosk and billboards with downloadable routes to community tourism sites are placed in accommodations and at terminals then visibility and visits to remote community tourism sites will increase.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Stage 1: Capturing of one (1) community & heritage tourism site in 360:

One community & heritage tourism site will be selected and captured using 360 cameras. The aim of this stage is to capture initial footage on a site which can be used to influence the design of the portal and kiosk display.

Stage 2: Creation of a splash page portal for the kiosk:

Using open-source software, the 360 footage will be uploaded and displayed on the portal for viewing by tourist.

Stage 3: Placement and implementation of the kiosk and QR code Boards.

A suitable location (place of accommodation) will be selected for both the kiosk and QR code boards to be placed. The portal will give the tourist the opportunity to email the Street View route to themselves enabling them to find the location of the site.

Stage 4: Collection of viewing information.

Information will be collected on the number of persons who view information on the sites using the portal both from the kiosk as well as from the boards. Such an approach would provide information on if tourist are using the approaches provided.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Views and downloads of the Street View routes to the Community Tourism sites.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Insights and usage of the boards as well as use of Kiosk will be used  to collect data on persons viewing the information on the sites.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
