Ethio Locate is a travel guide platform, that helps users find locations information and events for free with just simple clicks. This initiative intends to achieve a central database where travels or tourists or anyone seeking valuable information’s and locations of services providers on the digital world. The methodology that will lead us to a successful outcome is there is lack of information’s and locations of hospitality services providers in every city in Ethiopia and a high number of information seekers and services providers wanting to have a digital profile will lead us to a successful outcome.  Providing our country Ethiopia on a digital world and giving services providers a digital profile of their information’s and location is the outcome to be achieved. Our country Ethiopia has a lot of tourism destination places in different cities, currently we started to gather data from Addis Ababa but we are growing to different cities like Bahir dar, Gonder and Lalibela trying to replicate and so far we have good attraction and building network. The initiative is sustainable as long as the services providers are available. Given there is a gap of information in the service center, this product will be highly replicable.
