Control and Management of Single Use Diapers in eswatini
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the lack of an adequate waste disposal systems in peri-urban and rural areas results in the inappropriate disposal of sanitary waste, used single use disposable diapers. Diapers are currently disposed of indiscriminately in environmentally sensitive sites such as waterways, rangelands, etc where they clog waterways, flooding and are ingested by livestock thus affecting the livelihoods of small-scale livestock farmers. Additionally, the lack of more sustainable options that are higher up in the waste hierarchy as well as the lack of adequate solutions or technologies for appropriately disposing off single-use diapers, magnifies this challenge.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Since the invention of disposable diapers in the 1960s, consumption has skyrocketed. Along with the increase in use of disposables come numerous environmental consequences. The pollution of water systems caused by used diapers is becoming obvious in Eswatini where disposable diapers create large quantities of waste. While in many countries, the challenge of disposable diapers has in part been driven by the rise in incomes, in Eswatini we found that access to single use diapers has also been promoted by the availability of cheap options and innovative ways of selling them where for instance one can simply buy a single use diaper as opposed to buying the whole package. Additionally, the rise in working women who must still have to balance reproductive roles at home has led to the increased uptake of single use disposable diapers which reduce the need for washing of nappies. Currently the lack of an adequate disposal system for single use disposable diapers in peri urban and rural communities makes the proper collection and disposal of diapers very difficult. This is exacerbated by the lack of solutions/ technologies  for dealing with this type of waste even at disposal. Rural and peri-urban communities have reported that the available waste disposal systems they have are not suitable for this type of waste mainly because of the high rate at which it is generated as well as its low propensity to either decompose or be destroyed, for instance, it does not burn down using normal methods, it quickly fills up pit latrines (as it is hydroscopic  o), and it also quickly fills up waste pits which are normally used for waste disposal in rural areas.

Additionally, diapers are imported in high quantities and used at very high rates. Data from the Eswatini Revenue Authority shows that over 70 tonnes of single use disposable diapers were imported in the last 2 years (SRA, 2021). Furthermore, data from the 2017 census shows that there are about 130,000 babies of diaper wearing age in the country, and studies have shown that one baby produces at least one tonne of waste diapers in a year (https://realnappies.co.nz/, 2021) This challenge produces a lot of undesired effects. For instance, used disposable diapers may contain viruses and microbes which can cause public health problem if they are leached out from illegal dumpsites into the soil and water. Additionally, when ingested by livestock, they may result in their death, thus affecting the livelihoods of small-scale farmers who make up about 70% of the Swazi population. Improperly disposed of diapers can also clog waterways and result in flooding as seen during the high rain season in many parts of towns like Mbabane.  The main parties involved in this challenge include caregivers (mostly women), retailers (who distribute the diapers), municipalities (involved in collection), government, local community leaders, etc.

This, plus the high number of inappropriate single use diaper waste disposal sites across peri-urban and rural areas speaks to this challenge. https://www.facebook.com/1432638913625038/posts/2902514986637416/

This can be established from the number of illegal dumping sites in all peri-urban settlements for single use diapers, which unfortunately has not been done. However, evidence from the perception survey done under the Phatsa Sakho initiative including social media engagements during that experiment reveal the magnitude of the challenge based on people’s perceptions. https://www.facebook.com/1432638913625038/posts/2902514986637416/

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The work that the lab is going to be doing on this challenge is not necessarily new, hence our efforts will build on some existing work that has been started by local communities and partners. The added value being brought by the lab will be to use the lab protocols to unearth under the radar solutions that may be outside mainstream discussions. We also plan to leverage on the power of collective intelligence to bring in the wider community in finding solutions that have evaded mainstream development work around this challenge. The lab is also planning to promote solutions that are higher up the waste hierarchy, (i.e., those that promote waste avoidance, minimization, re-use, recycling, etc.) and aims to promote a circular as opposed to a liner economy around waste.

Unlike other actors within UNDP and other stakeholders in the country, the acc lab has the flexibility to explore and experiment with uncommon, or unorthodox solutions that other actors may find risky (i.e., in terms of resources needed, time, etc.). the single use diaper challenge is one that has been without sustainable solutions for a while, especially at disposal stage. Many solutions that exist within the country remain at idea or prototype stage, and the lab has the flexibility to experiment with these and bring them to the mainstream of development interventions. Past UNDP and EEA initiatives have revealed the need to work on this challenge. The results of the perception study undertaken as part of the Phatsa Nawe campaign on single use plastic bags showed that this was considered as a priority challenge especially for peri-urban and rural communities. Other work done by UNDP in the past including a Waste Indaba (conference) pointed to the need to find sustainable solutions to the waste challenge. Consultations doe as part of developing community development strategies among 33 communities under the Strengthening Protected Areas Systems Project (SNPAS), showed a bias of communities towards this challenge as one that existed with minimal sustainable solutions. This, among other things, motivated the work that the lab is ding on this challenge. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Eswatini AccLab is working on finding sustainable solutions to the challenge of single use diapers in the country with the aim of providing evidence that waste should not just be considered as a burden, but that sustainable management can create jobs and cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The Ministry of Health is a key partner in sanitary waste issues and will form a major stakeholder for our interventions. In Ludzeludze we will work with bagcugcuteli from these five areas to undertake the experiment. Since they work with caregivers on a frequent basis, they present an unusual data source on sanitary issues within communities and will be used by the AccLab to assist with mapping and monitoring activities of the experiment. Under the current political instability and COVID 19 environment, they present an opportunity for undisturbed access to target participants within these areas as they will be working in familiar surroundings and with their usual target audience
