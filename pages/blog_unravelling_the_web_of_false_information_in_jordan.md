Unravelling the Web of False Information in Jordan

Unravelling the Web of False Information in Jordan Insights from Our Think Board
November 29, 2023

Have you ever found yourself mindlessly scrolling through your social media feed, shaking your head at a news headline, and thinking, "Well, that can't be true"? If so, you're among the fortunate few who still question what they encounter. In Jordan, research conducted by The Rased-Hayat Centre (2023) has revealed alarming habits exhibited by the general population while interacting with news on social media platforms. Addressing the epidemic of false information in Jordan is crucial, and the UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab has recognized this troubling trend and embarked on a mission to find innovative ways to address it.

Reasons and motivations for sharing news via social media as reported by The Rased-Hayat Centre
Understanding the Impact of False InformationFalse information has become a tremendous challenge in our society in the current digital age. It refers to the unintentional but potentially harmful transmission of inaccurate information. False headlines, viral hoaxes, and manipulated photos infiltrate our news feeds, distorting our perception of reality and influencing our knowledge. One of the reasons behind the spread of false information is confirmation bias, where individuals tend to seek information that aligns with their beliefs while disregarding contradictory evidence. This bias is particularly evident on social media platforms, exacerbating polarization on critical issues like climate change.False information can have dire consequences, as recently seen in the case of vaccination hesitancy in Jordan. False narratives and misleading information about the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccines circulated on social media platforms, leading to doubts about their safety and efficacy, while contributing to decreased vaccination rates. The incident highlighted the urgent need to combat false information and promote accurate information to protect public health.

Effective Approaches to Combat False InformationAddressing false Information requires a multifaceted approach, acknowledging that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, certain strategies have shown effectiveness in combating false Information. Promoting media literacy and supporting fact-checking organizations helps individuals critically assess information and verify the accuracy of news and content. Transparency in algorithms is essential for reducing the visibility of false content on online platforms. Furthermore, fostering critical thinking skills empowers individuals to question and verify information before accepting it as true. Recognizing the context and nature of the false Information problem is crucial in determining which combination of strategies will be most effective in combating it.Introducing the UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab FrameworkThe UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab is implementing its process to tackle false Information in Jordan. This process allows us to understand, assess, map solutions, run experiments, and scale successful interventions. By following this framework, the lab aims to address the prevalence of false Information in Jordan and develop context-relevant interventions.Understand False Information:The first step is to delve into why false Information happens and explore previous effective methods in combatting it. By studying the underlying causes and successful approaches, the lab gains valuable insights to inform its strategies.Assess False Information in Jordan:To gain a comprehensive understanding of the false Information landscape in Jordan, the lab utilises AI analysis of online platforms and conducts primary research. By collecting data from Twitter and other sources, it identifies trends, sentiments, and instances of hate speech. Map Solutions:Using the information gathered from online research and primary investigations, the lab maps out possible solutions and interventions tailored to address false Information in Jordan. This stage ensures that the solutions proposed align with the specific challenges and context of the country.Run Experiments:To test the effectiveness of potential solutions, the lab conducts experiments within the Jordanian context. These experiments allow for iterative learning and refinement of interventions to maximise their impact.Scale Solutions:Once successful interventions are identified through experimentation, the lab focuses on scaling those projects to reach a larger audience. Scalability ensures that the solutions have a broader impact and contribute to mitigating the risks of false Information across Jordan. The UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab recognizes the urgent need to combat false Information in Jordan. By understanding the underlying causes, assessing the prevalence of false Information, and mapping context-relevant interventions, the lab aims to develop effective strategies to address this issue. Through its innovative framework, which includes research, data analysis, experimentation, and scalability, the lab endeavours to contribute to building a more informed and resilient society in Jordan.

Key TakeawaysFalse information poses a significant challenge in Jordan, with various motivations for sharing false or unverified information on social media platforms. The consequences of false Information can be real and far-reaching, as seen in the case of vaccination hesitancy in Jordan, and it erodes trust in reliable sources and institutions. Addressing false information requires a multifaceted approach, including research, data analysis, and tailored solutions that consider local contexts and sentiments. The UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab is actively working on innovative solutions to combat false information, utilizing machine learning, primary research, and other methods to better understand and address the issue in Jordan.
