In Ho Chi Minh City, it is estimated that there are about 4,000 visually impaired people, many of whom have become role models for their energy, passion and contributions to society. Despite their own efforts and the support of the government and community organizations, visually impaired people still face many challenges in learning, employment, community integration and creating a stable life. Part of this is social stigma, and part is the lack of caring for blind and visually impaired people in general. Job training and creating stable jobs for blind people is limited in Ho Chi Minh City. A current survey revealed that in Vietnam, just only 6.3% of visually impaired and blind people are employed. However for many other blind and visually impaired, the “work” is still mainly unskilled labour and the average monthly income remains low. We at Noir. Dining in the Dark, have opened the door to another career for the blind and visually impaired. Through our innovative training techniques, we improve these talented individuals’ self confidence and career trajectory. We are proud to put them in a position where they assume responsibility for our guests and a transfer of trust is the norm. Since we began this business, we have been inspired by visually impaired and blind people and we are dedicated to the blind community. A certain percentage of our profits will be donated to charities which work with local blind and visually impaired people, including organizations which provide operations to restore sight to visually impaired children.

Think of modern society and images of shining cities and glowing screens come to mind. Every facet of daily life depends on sight. How would your other senses react to being in complete darkness? At Noir. Dining in the Dark, you will embark on a sensory journey into a different world and savour exquisite tastes and textures in complete darkness. This multi-sensory dining experience will stimulate your senses and open your mind. The experience begins in our pitch black dining room where you will be guided and served by blind or visually impaired staff who have been specially trained to assist and reassure sighted guests who are in complete darkness. Transfer your trust to these skilled guides they lead you to experience a new way of sensing the environment around you. After a few moments of adjustment, the darkness will kill off any shyness or trepidation and bring about an open-minded atmosphere. Our unique menus are a symphony of flavours. And will stimulate your other senses as you are deprived of the dominating sense of sight. Textures and subtle flavours will come to the forefront as you dine your way through unique dishes that have not been described beforehand. You will discover the stunning truth that people tend to experience food with their eyes, rather than with their palates. At Noir. Dining in the Dark, it is more than just a meal. It is a sensory journey that will make you re-evaluate your perception of taste and smell. Be one of the first to try this one-of-a-kind dining experience for a unique date or group outing in Saigon.

OUR TEAM
This has been an experience of people's lives and values.


It has been around four months since we got connected to our future team through the Blind Association Centre. During the job interviews, they have completely eliminated our original concerns about starting a new career in hospitality. They told us inspiring stories of their extraordinary energy, tenacity; about faith, optimism and their values.


They have indeed motivated and inspired us to develop this concept, a concept to help people experience their other senses through dining. This social business will help and boost awareness toward the visually impaired and blind community in the region. And then the first restaurant with the concept Dining in the Dark in Saigon was born, called Noir. Dining in the Dark.


From the first days of training until today, we have learned to live and to experience their world for a better understanding of their lives. For them, it is a doorway to the field of hospitality service excellence. What is wine? How wine is fermented? What is the shape of an artichoke? What does it smell like? What colour is it? Why there are so many types of glasses? Why is a dessert spoon smaller than a tablespoon? In the dark, why do we need to smile when talking with guests? Or why do we need to iron the napkins when the guests cannot even see it? Why does a dish have so many spices and herbs?


Thousands of questions, hundreds of hours of training, and a new world gradually opened up to them and also to all of us. Now, they are fully equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their job and are ready to welcome the first guests with a most positive attitude and excitement.


We are really proud of our team, because they are the ones who make the difference.
