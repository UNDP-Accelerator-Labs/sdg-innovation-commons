The stickers are designed based on the solid waste regulations of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and aim to help people identify what type of waste they discard, and in this way, help waste collectors to classify in an easier way, increasing recycling.  


It is a frugal method and is replicable in different communities, thanks to its low cost and ease of manufacture.
