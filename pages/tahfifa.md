Description: 
The first mobile hairdressing application in Algeria for men and women. Tahfifa is the easiest way to get the services of a professional hairstylist, anytime, at home, in the office or at the salon. The client can finally book an appointment with his personal hairdresser or the closest one to his home. The feedback provided by our app also allows customers to choose the hairstylist they want.

Origin of the solution: 
Algeria Startup Challenge/Coronhackathon. A partnership between UNDP Accelerator Lab. and Cap CoWork Incubator.
