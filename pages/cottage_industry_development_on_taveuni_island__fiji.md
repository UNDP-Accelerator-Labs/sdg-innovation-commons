Tutu Rural Training Centre on the island of Taveuni has established a food development unit to encourage cottage industries on the island. Cottage industries are small-scale, home-based manufacturing businesses. This innovative initiative has allowed for new forms of income generation, self reliance, improved nutrition, opportunities for women entrepreneurs, and reduction of food wastage through food preservation methods such as dehydrating and pickling.
