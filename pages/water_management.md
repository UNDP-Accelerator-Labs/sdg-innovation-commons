The solution consists of both hardware (IoT) and software: the hardware is a device that connects to water meters, reads the consumption information, and sends it to the database. 


The software is the user interface, through which the user will be able to receive continuous information about water consumption. Total and monthly consumption (both in m3 and manat), monthly limit, statistics, etc. are displayed in the interface. 


Ideally, it can be integrated into the Azersun system (i.e. the state agency that regulates the supply of the water in the households), which will lead to manage it optimally by automatic restriction of water supply for highly indebted users, and restoration of supply shortly after the debt is repaid, etc.
