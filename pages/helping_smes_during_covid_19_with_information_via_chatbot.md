During the Rapid Impact Assessment on SMEs in Ukraine in mid-March, we realized that the anxiety was growing, making it more difficult for businesses to solve a snowball of issues. One of the reasons for anxiety was uncertainty about rental agreements- SMEs did not know whether they will be able to protect their offices/shops/production facilities during the quarantine. They were getting curious about obtaining a Certificate of Force Majeure that is supposed to protect them from any action of a landlord. The only organization that is authorized to issue such certificates is the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce, so we reached out to them and asked whether they are able to meet the growing demand and issue enough certificates. They said that the storm of requests is coming, while not every business needs the certificate and there is a lot of confusion about it. To support the Chamber, we studied the flow of their conversations with SMEs and designed the chatbot that could answer most of the questions and "take the hit". 



This turned out to be an innovative solution for the Chamber of Commerce of Ukraine that helped to take the increasing workload off the staff shoulders and provide SMEs with the necessary information and recommendations.
