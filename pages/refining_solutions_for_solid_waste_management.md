Refining solutions for solid waste management
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is that&nbsp; Malawi has one of the fastest urbanization rates at 4.19% per annum. Like all fast urbanizing cities, Malawi’s cities – namely Blantyre, Lilongwe, Zomba and Mzuzu – are challenged by accumulation of waste due to high urbanization and limited resources and coordination of their public services. On average, these cities produce a high amount of solid waste estimated at around 300,000 metric tonnes, of which a very small percentage is collected (12%), processed or treated.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The city councils are struggling to collect waste from residential areas, institutions and other communal points within the city. Inadequate financing limits the council from investing in equipment and vehicles to achieve adequate waste collection and disposal. There's a plethora of small scale private waste collectors and recyclers who do not always officially work with the council. Financing and collaboration are some of the challenges facing the private players.&nbsp; Support from UNDP Malawi and other donor agencies introduced waste transfer stations in some communities to empower communities to reduce and manage waste that goes to dumpsites and create employment for youth and women through recycling and compost manure making. Challenges of foul smell, poor quality of compost and poor waste collection and management of the transfer stations has left the project unattractive to communities. Waste management privatization has been partially done in most of the city councils although private waste collectors (largely informal) are only filling part of the gap due to technical and operational challenges. Coordination among waste generators (households, institutions), waste collectors and recyclers who create and sell products remains very weak. Technology, innovations and behaviour change interventions to create critical mass for shifting civic perceptions and action in reduction and management of waste are inadequate. Lastly, we lack structured markets for organic waste products like composted manure. Opportunities exist however for innovative recycling of waste

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Leveraging on the convening power of the CO-able to bring diverse players together.


Ability to tap into other sources of funding to revive discussions on waste being a challenge that has already attracted enormous funding, donor interest without much gain.&nbsp;


Ability to tap into the global lab network for solutions and strategies to enhance learning at local level.&nbsp;

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP Malawi #AcceleratorLab is leveraging its global network of learning labs and ability to collaborate across silos to test solutions for managing waste in Lilongwe.&nbsp;&nbsp;


The solutions include mobile apps, improved composting and community action.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We want to know if mobile-based tools for waste management stakeholders, thermophilic composting, and applying community action to sensitize communities on best practices for waste management and implementing behaviour change strategies can reduce the amount of unmanaged waste in a community.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral Insights: to learn what nudges people in the communities to start segregating waste at source and if digital systems can nudge waste collectors to collect waste timely.&nbsp;


Participatory Design: to involve communities in identifying and designing local interventions for improving waste management.&nbsp;


Pilots: tests the efficacy of compost manure on plots; observe Smart trashcans in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;


Prototyping: develop iterations on Smart Trashcans based on feedback from the pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;


MVP: Iterations on Smart Trashcan will lead the development of a minimal viable product for city councils.&nbsp;

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

To understand quantity and type of waste generated at each households and analyze trends. Also check the response rate of the service providers.&nbsp; Understand what strategies / policies lead to behaviour change especially around segregating waste at source&nbsp;


Sensor and sensor network data: Internet of Things (IoT) devices with sensors detect level of waste in trash cans.&nbsp;


Mobile phone data: Level of waste in trash cans is transmitted to a dashboard using 2G mobile network.&nbsp;


Geospatial data: Location of the bin is recorded and sent to a dashboard for monitoring and management.&nbsp;


App data: households and waste collectors will use a mobile app to request and respond to waste services.&nbsp;


Observation: Field visits to observe status and operation of Smart Trashcans.&nbsp;


SMS Surveys: data collected from a SMS survey will be analysed to understand how households handle waste.&nbsp;


Scientific research: A university will research the efficacy of compost manure and analyse attitudes and perceptions for farmers.&nbsp;
