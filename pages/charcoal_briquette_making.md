> Brief description of the innovation

To make briquettes, you need organic waste that is rich in 
carbon. Wood, dry, brown organic waste is rich in carbon in addition
dry leaves, twigs, straw, groundnut shells, coconut shells and 
sawdust can also be used
To make charcoal briquettes you need to carbonise the material. 
If you are using sawdust you can just mix it with a binder to make it adhere to the coal. 
The raw material is burnt to black powder but its not allowed to turn to ash. After adding the binder to the powder, the briquettes are then made to the desired shapes

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will be selling these briquettes to poultry Farmers as well as households and this is how we will generate income.
This in turn will make these people's businesses easier. The challenge prize will help us grow the business as it will help us get  advanced machinery, which will help us make enough briquettes at a faster rate.
The value addition is that this is an environmentally  friendly process in that, unlike the regular charcoal, briquettes are not made from cut wood. This means that there will be a reduction in deforestation as well as landfills as household waste will be used too . This in turn would repair the proper ecosystem and help curb global warming as well as land pollution

> Technical Feasibility

We use a metal drum to burn the raw materials and a manual hand compressor to shape up the briquettes.
We plan to work for ourselves since this is when we are starting.  We are currently funding ourselves and the funds aren't enough. We have a bank account in which we put the little savings. This is what will help us save.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is very relevant in that, when we use these raw materials, we help keep the environment safe for everyone.
