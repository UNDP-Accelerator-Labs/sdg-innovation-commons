Small scale farmers are limited from increasing production due to high cost and inaccessible equipment required to improve efficiency in harvesting and processing of the crops. The innovator has designed a multi purpose equipment that has functions to grate, grind and shell crops to help farmers reduce agro processing costs and provide easy access to equipment within the local market.
