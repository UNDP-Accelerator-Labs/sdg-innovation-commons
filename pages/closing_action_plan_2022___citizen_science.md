## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Citizen science is a versatile tool with multiple effects at different levels and can be utilized for various purposes.  

Promotes inclusion and diversity by democratizing knowledge production through the involvement of a greater number and diversity of actors and types of evidence. It recognizes the value of local, experiential, and ancestral knowledge, expanding discussions on what to investigate and for what purpose. This enriches the research processes by incorporating different logics, motivations, and voices. 

Furthermore, citizen science fosters learning and behavior change. It enables the acquisition of new knowledge, attitudes, and dispositions and serves as an educational tool for holistic teaching and interdisciplinary learning. It also influences the government agenda by channeling and reinforcing activism in territories, supporting the claims and concerns of civil society. Large-scale data collection and visualization can draw attention to important issues and generate evidence to address emerging or existing problems. 

Citizen science promotes democratic governance by allowing the participation of individuals who typically lack a voice in other spaces. Citizens can shape the topics and objectives of research, and their sociodemographic diversity requires segmented strategies. Additionally, it provides governments with a more comprehensive understanding of the issues affecting citizens, enabling them to develop interventions tailored to their needs and accepted through consensus. 

Another significant aspect is that citizen science drives innovation, adoption, and the use of diverse technologies. User-friendly tools empower citizens to collect data, increasing the likelihood of their utilization by governments. Low-cost sensors, mobile applications, drones, artificial intelligence, among others, are leveraged, expediting data collection, diversifying sources, and facilitating information exchange. 

Moreover, citizen science promotes evidence-based public policies by enriching management and decision-making processes. Government officials can utilize citizen science to obtain a large amount of data within a short period, from a pluralistic perspective, facilitating the formation of alliances and consensus. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that the evidence is effectively utilized in decision-making.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

This learning cycle had significant growth during 2022. It was a challenge to generate the time to consolidate this learning cycle, keeping spaces for other new cycles. In 2023, we hope to forge new alliances, consolidate growth paths at the national public sector level. And we aim to explore opportunities to internationalize our experience, through collaboration with other countries. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Citizen science is participatory by definition; however, the experiments gave a new meaning and allowed varying the participation of citizens in different experiences to single out its effects. We had to take a good amount of time and resources to get information from direct sources. The collaborative mapping of solutions, in continuous growth. It allowed consolidating the knowledge of solutions and, in turn, the learning cycle. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The selected methods allowed us to increase our understanding of collaborative dynamics in Citizen Science and learn about new examples, which in turn allowed new articulations with partners. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Collaborative actions were developed with non-traditional partners, such as El Gato y La Caja (a participatory group and a research, communication and design platform reaching hundreds of thousands of Spanish-speaking people, https://elgatoylacaja.com/). We also co-organized with FARN a workshop to bring citizen science practices closer to the design of environmental public policies to clean up the Matanza Riachuelo Basin. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Many of the projects that we mapped and subsequently experimented with are overseen by professional researchers who led citizen science projects. Among these teams of researchers, there were two from La Plata and Buenos Aires Universities who oversaw two different solutions and led the design and fieldwork of both of the experiments conducted.  

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We would be interested in seeking out funds from the private sector to promote a future portfolio of actions.   

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The citizen science solutions mapping was co-created with the Argentine Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MINCYT).  Along the way, we built and iterated our mapping cards where we included descriptions of the initiatives, the purpose of which is to systematize the information collected and enable comparisons. All the information was validated by the leaders of each of the initiatives.. Now, the solutions mapping is currently growing collaboratively. In October 2022, MINCYT created a nationwide program of federal promotion of local citizen science. This program, in 2023, will finance citizen science projects; expand mapping and set up permanent initiatives monitoring, identifying opportunities, challenges and lessons learned at different stages, according to the diversity of participants and methodologies used; promote civil society participation in these types of initiatives; foster citizen science training, participatory research methodologies and other related areas of expertise; and encourage studies and research related to citizen science in Argentina to feed public policies in various areas of intervention. In 2022, we continued our partnership with the National Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation and the cities of Buenos Aires, Quilmes, San Antonio de Areco, Balcarce and Mercedes, in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The stakeholders involved in the development of the mapped solutions typically lack previous connections with UNDP. The Lab has established partnerships with various stakeholders, such as government entities focused on science, technology, and innovation, as well as civil society organizations. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In 2023, we plan to work with areas of the CO that allow consolidating the growth of the learning cycle, to take the dynamics of Citizen Science to new jurisdictions; collaborating particularly with the Inclusive Development Cluster and strategically with the Communication area to ensure the dissemination of the impact that these initiatives can generate.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We have worked through a portfolio of actions to foster the growth of citizen science in Argentina. For those who have been developing citizen science projects, mainly based on their conviction and commitment, we  promoted and supported the creation of a national program that recognizes their work and allows them to compete for funds. This program is a significant milestone. Plus, we were able to work with local governments by means of alliances that allowed us to test and scale different citizen science experiences. These experiments showed that citizen science is a versatile approach to address complex problems in their different dimensions, individual and collective, behavioral, and public policy, from a systemic perspective. Thanks to these, we identified effects on citizen commitment to environmental issues, on innovation in environmental policy, on greater coordination between areas to address environmental issues, and on environmental governance.
