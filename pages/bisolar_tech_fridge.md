> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

More than 780 million people worldwide do not have access to reliable electricity, the FAO has estimated that around 50% percent of food products in Cameroon are lost between harvest and consumption due to inadequate conservation and storage. The necessary infrastructure for cold storage for vaccines and other medical goods remains insufficient in many of these areas. Our solution, Bi-Solar Tech Fridge is a 100% solar fridge that can work 24h a day without  using batteries. Made to create solar-powered cold storage units  for multiple applications, including pre-cooling, cold storage and charging a cold storage unit.
