> Title of the innovation

The agricultural and food industry is an important economic sector in many African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, it has the potential to drive economic development and contribute to food security and income generation.   Innovative solutions are the key to boosting productivity, income and employment. New digital ideas for the agricultural and food industry are coming from the growing local start-up scene more and more. With their digital innovations, Maize farming is one key factor

> Brief description of the innovation

The agricultural and food industry is an important economic sector in many African countries Zambia in particular has the potential to drive economic development and contribute to food security and income generation. 

Innovative solutions are the key to boosting productivity, income and employment. New digital ideas for the agricultural and food industry are coming from the growing local start-up scene more and more. With their digital innovations, young companies often address well-known challenges, including the availability of advisory services, market access for small farmers and improving the quality of cultivation and harvesting methods. Additional challenges include organising storage, logistics and processing, and access to financial services for the rural population. 

However, despite beneficial innovations and viable business models, most start-ups fail to achieve a wide-impact and therefore also fail to drive forward the modernisation and development of the agricultural and food industry. The solutions developed reach only a limited number of users. A key challenge is therefore to distribute the available digital innovations for the agricultural and food sector in a way that generates secure incomes.  

Objective
Proven digital innovations for the agricultural and food sector have been distributed in selected markets in a way that generates income.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

One of the major benefits of innovation is its contribution to economic growth. Simply put, innovation can lead to higher productivity, meaning that the same input generates a greater output. As productivity rises, more goods and services are produced – in other words, the economy grows.

Innovation is important to the advancement of society as it solves these kinds of social problems and enhances society's capacity to act. It's responsible for resolving collective problems in a sustainable and efficient way, usually with new technology.

From agriculture to transport, technology is changing the way we live our lives and interact with those around us. ... As well as technology, innovation is also helping in terms of jobs and economic growth. It's estimated that the world economy could more than double in size by 2050, due to technology-driven improvements

Promoting innovation allows you to achieve, politically and practically, more ambitious policy goals. It allows organisations to see a way to meet the environmental goals more cheaply, and it creates winners - creating new markets, business opportunities and exports.

> Technical Feasibility

As the human population continues to grow, our demand for food increases. Farmers are under continuous pressure to produce more food, faster. Environmental sustainability in agriculture is an equally important topic to discuss in parallel with mass food production.

Overproduction is a severe issue in our world, and daily harms the environment. Currently, agricultural pursuits take up almost half of the world's habitable land. Millions of hectares of natural habitats are lost, leaving thousands of species homeless.

As it is, agricultural activities already contribute around 10 percent to the Zambia total greenhouse gas emissions.

It's simply not sustainable to increase agricultural land at the expense of nature. Wild spaces help maintain the Earth's fragile grip on healthy ecosystems. In turn, these natural ecosystems assist in reducing global warming and maintaining clean water systems.

Farmers are slowly, but surely, realizing how crucial sustainable agriculture practices are to increase yields and ensure the future of their industry and food security for all.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Perhaps the biggest impact innovation has had on society is regarding technology, which is, in effect, embedded in almost everything we do. From agriculture to transport, technology is changing the way we live our lives and interact with those around us. 

For instance, we use agriculture to raise animals and grow food, such as tomatoes, carrots, meat and eggs. The importance of agriculture make us less dependent on other foreign countries, provides food and shelter and also provides us with income to the farmer and revenue to the government.
