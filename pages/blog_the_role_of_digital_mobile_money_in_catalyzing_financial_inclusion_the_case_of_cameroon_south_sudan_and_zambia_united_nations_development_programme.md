Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
Background

In Cameroon, digital financial inclusion
has emerged as a powerful tool for
enhancing economic participation
and reducing poverty, particularly in
underserved regions. With mobile phone
penetration reaching approximately 90%
of the population and the widespread
adoption of mobile wallets, companies
like MTN and Orange are spearheading
this transformation. However, significant
challenges remain, especially in
rural areas where access to energy,
infrastructure, and financial literacy are
limited. Integrating renewable energy
solutions into digital financial initiatives,
such as Orange’s Digital Houses ,
presents an opportunity to create self-
sustaining communities. This approach
not only addresses energy deficits but
also empowers local populations by
promoting education, enabling access
to digital financial services, and fostering
economic resilience.

Despite the rapid growth of mobile
wallet usage in urban areas such as
Douala and Yaoundé, rural regions
face a significant digital divide.
The disparity between urban and
rural access highlights the need for
comprehensive solutions that address
both infrastructure limitations and
gender disparities in mobile wallet
adoption

Objectives

This report aims to:
● Assess the current state of mobile
wallet usage and financial inclusion in
Cameroon.
● Analyze regional and demographic
disparities in mobile wallet adoption.
● Highlight successful strategies and
challenges in promoting mobile financial
inclusion, particularly in rural areas.
● Propose policy recommendations to
enhance financial inclusion across the
country.

Methodology

A comprehensive desk review was
conducted, focusing on the state of
digital financial inclusion in Cameroon.
This review synthesized data from a wide
range of sources, including:

● Research Papers: Key academic studies
on digital financial services in Cameroon.
● Government Reports: National financial
inclusion strategies from the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications .
● International Organization Publications:
Reports from the UNDP , World Bank , and
IMF on digital finance.
● Industry Reports: Market research
from mobile wallet providers, focusing
on private-sector innovations driving
financial inclusion.

In addition to the desk review, a survey
was conducted to gather primary
data from mobile wallet users across
Cameroon, with a focus on understanding
usage patterns, satisfaction, and barriers
to adoption.

Desk Review Findings
Definition

Digital Mobile Wallets
An e-money account which is primarily
accessed using a mobile phone and which
is held with the e-money issuer. In some
jurisdictions, e-money accounts may
resemble conventional bank accounts,
but are treated differently under the
regulatory framework because they are
used for different purposes (for example,
as a substitute for cash or a stored value
used to facilitate transactional services).

Financial Inclusion
Financial inclusion ensures that adults
have access to a variety of appropriate
financial services that they can use
effectively. These services must be
delivered responsibly and safely to
consumers, and in a manner that is
sustainable for providers, within a well-
regulated environment

Financial Services
Financial services are broadly defined
as the economic services provided by
financial institutions, which include
banking, investment, insurance, and
wealth management. These services
play a crucial role in managing, growing,
and protecting the financial resources of
individuals and businesses. They facilitate
key functions such as accepting deposits,
providing loans, enabling payment
systems, managing assets, and offering
insurance solutions

Mobile Payment
The use of a mobile phone to access
financial services and execute financial
transactions. This includes both
transactional and non-transactional
services, such as viewing financial
information on a user’s mobile phone.
Mobile money, mobile insurance, mobile
credit and mobile savings are mobile
financial services

Digital Financial Inclusion:
Digital financial inclusion entails using
cost-effective digital technologies to
provide formal financial services to
populations that are currently excluded
or underserved. These services are
tailored to meet the specific needs of
these communities, ensuring they are
delivered responsibly and are affordable
for customers while remaining sustainable
for service providers

Financial Products
Defined as instruments or services
offered by financial institutions that
allow individuals and businesses to
manage their financial resources. These
products include savings accounts,
loans, investment funds, and insurance
policies. Financial services also encompass
activities like facilitating payment
systems, managing assets, and offering
credit or loans.

Internet of Things (IoT) integration with
mobile wallets can facilitate seamless
transactions across multiple devices.
Smart devices linked to mobile wallets will
enable automatic payments for utilities,
transportation, and other services, greatly
improving convenience for users in urban
areas.

Biometric Authentication methods, such
as fingerprint and facial recognition, will
further secure mobile wallets in all three
countries. These technologies ensure that
only authorized users can access their
accounts, reducing the risk of fraud and
identity theft, particularly in countries
like Cameroon, where security is a key
concern for mobile wallet users.

These advancements are expected to
play a critical role in expanding financial
inclusion and improving the overall
efficiency of digital financial services
across

Financial Services
And Products

Future technological advancements are
set to significantly influence the evolution
of digital mobile wallets in Cameroon. Key
areas of development include:

Blockchain Technology could enhance
security, transparency, and efficiency
in digital transactions. By utilizing
decentralized ledger technology, mobile
wallets in these countries can offer more
secure and tamper-proof transactions,
reducing fraud and boosting user trust,
especially in regions like Center and
Littoral, where security concerns are
heightened.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
Learning (ML) have the potential to
improve user experience by offering
personalized financial services and
detecting fraud. AI and ML can analyze
transaction patterns to provide
customized financial products and alert
users to suspicious activities, thereby
enhancing security and increasing user
engagement, particularly in Center, where
digital finance is more established.

5G Connectivity is expected to
revolutionize mobile wallet transactions
by improving speed and reliability. The
introduction of 5G in these countries
will lead to faster data transfer and lower
latency, enhancing real-time payment
processing. This is particularly important
for rural areas, where connectivity issues
remain a barrier to widespread mobile
wallet adoption.

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
Data Collection
Trends

The comprehensive analysis of MTN and Orange data in Cameroon,
contextualized within the broader scope of digital financial inclusion, unveils
distinct patterns that illuminate both opportunities and obstacles in expanding
financial access. MTN demonstrates a robust penetration among young adults,
particularly within the 20-30 age bracket. Compared to Orange, which primarily
attracts middle-aged users, MTN’s growth is driven by a youthful demographic
actively seeking accessible and cost-effective financial solutions. The observed
annual growth rate, ranging between +2% and +3%, indicates a positive
trajectory that aligns with the broader objective of expanding affordable
financial services to a younger population segment, which might not have
substantial sources of income yet but is highly engaged in digital finance.

In contrast, Orange’s user base is predominantly concentrated in the 40-50 age
group, exhibiting an annual growth rate between +4% and +5%. This trend
suggests that middle-aged users, likely with more stable financial resources,
gravitate towards Orange’s offerings, which appear to cater to more sophisticated
and comprehensive financial needs. The higher costs associated with Orange’s
services imply a preference for quality and diversified financial products among
this demographic, distinguishing it from MTN’s appeal to a younger, more cost-
sensitive audience. This indicates that Orange’s financial services are possibly
more diversified and perceived as premium offerings in the market, which
contrasts with MTN’s strategy of targeting cost-sensitive younger users.

UNDP Report Accelerator Lab
Beyond mobile wallet services, financial inclusion in Cameroon encompasses traditional
community-based systems such as “Tontines,” particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. These
collective savings mechanisms, augmented by digital solutions like Orange’s “Digital Houses,” reflect
an annual growth rate of +3% to +4%. This integration of traditional financial practices with modern
technology enhances access to financial services for marginalized populations, offering a scalable
model for inclusive growth. Such initiatives build on existing infrastructure and local customs,
providing a replicable framework for other financial institutions aiming to broaden financial
inclusion

Partnerships between mobile operators and
microfinance institutions are further accelerating
financial inclusion. These collaborations have increased
access to credit and insurance services by +5% to +6%
through mobile platforms. This synergy is crucial for
extending financial services to rural areas, contributing
significantly to poverty alleviation and broader
economic integration. The presence of financial service
points in areas affected by crises, inferred through
the presence of Mobile Wallet Sale/Withdrawal Points
during such events, underscores the resilience and
adaptability of mobile financial services in maintaining
economic stability during periods of disruption. This
method of leveraging crisis-related data to identify
potential financial service infrastructure highlights
an innovative approach to ensuring the availability of
financial services, even in less visible or high-risk areas.

In conclusion, while MTN and Orange
command substantial market shares,
the progression of financial inclusion in
Cameroon is characterized by a holistic
strategy that blends technological
innovations with deeply ingrained
community-based financial practices. This
approach facilitates balanced growth,
enhances economic empowerment, and
plays a pivotal role in mitigating financial
disparities across the nation.

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
Mobile Money Service Usage by Region and Area (Urban vs Rural) An analysis of the data
collected shows a marked regional disparity in mobile money service adoption. The Centre region,
with its better infrastructure, exhibits the highest number of users (33), followed by the Littoral (19)
and the Far North (17). These regions show a clear preference for MTN Mobile Money and Orange
Money services. In contrast, regions such as the East and North-West demonstrate significantly
lower levels of mobile wallet adoption.

Urban areas present the highest adoption rates of mobile financial services, while rural areas
lag. The graphs show a clear clustering of mobile money service users in urban and semi-urban
regions, reflecting better network access, greater financial literacy, and a more diverse set of
financial services. By comparison, rural areas exhibit limited usage, highlighting the infrastructural
and educational gaps that need to be addressed to improve financial inclusion in these areas.
The graph also reveals that there is limited knowledge and low usage of other innovative finance
mobile wallet opportunities. There is dependency across the 10 regions on the wallets of the two
main telecommunication networks, MTN and Orange, due to their wallets’ attachment to the
mobile communication sim cards, and, the significant coverage of these mobile networks across the
Country.

11

UNDP Report Accelerator Lab
Mobile Money Usage by Age and Gender Data on mobile money usage by age
group reveals that the majority of users are aged 26-35, with 35 male users and 19
female users in this demographic. The 18-25 age group follows, with 19 male users and
16 female users. Usage sharply decreases in older age groups, with only 2 male and 2
female users aged over 45.

This pattern reflects a generational divide,
with younger adults more comfortable
with mobile technologies and digital
financial services. Men, across all age
groups, are more likely to use mobile
money services than women. This trend
further accentuates the gender gap in
financial inclusion, particularly among
older populations. It is vital to address
these gender disparities to promote
inclusive economic participation.

Mobile Money Usage by Occupation
The analysis of mobile money usage
by occupation reveals that students
and employed individuals are the most
active users of mobile financial services.
Students (37 total users) and employed
individuals (30 users) show high
adoption rates. Entrepreneurs exhibit
lower adoption rates, and unemployed
individuals are the least likely to use
mobile money services.

12

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
This correlation between occupation and mobile money usage underscores the
importance of stable income sources in facilitating financial inclusion. Those who
are economically active have greater access to mobile financial services, while those
without stable employment face more significant barriers.
Mobile Money Usage by Area and Gender disparities in mobile money usage
extend across geographic areas. Urban areas display the highest number of users,
with a notable divide between male (43) and female (24) users. The gender gap
persists even in rural areas, where male users (10) significantly outnumber female
users (4). This data suggests that women, especially in rural areas, face substantial
barriers in accessing mobile financial services.

13

Preferred Mobile Money Services

Orange Money leads as the most
preferred mobile financial service, with
90 users, followed by MTN Mobile Money
with 50 users. Other services, such as UBA
Mobile Money and Sara Money, exhibit
much lower usage rates, suggesting that
the mobile money market in Cameroon is
concentrated around these two dominant
providers. These figures highlight the
need for fostering competition and
encouraging the diversification of service
providers to increase financial inclusion.

To encourage the adoption of mobile
wallets from providers outside of telecom
operators, several approaches can be
explored. First, it is essential to promote
strategic partnerships between these
non-telecom players and local businesses
or financial institutions. A notable
example is M-Pesa, which expanded
its influence in East Africa through a
strategic alliance with Safaricom . A similar
approach could be implemented in other
regions by fostering collaborations with
local banks or fintech companies.

Moreover, hackathons and innovation
competitions are excellent ways to stimulate
the development of local solutions tailored to
market needs. In India, such initiatives have led
to the creation of digital payment applications
like PhonePe, demonstrating how these contests
can generate innovative ideas in the financial
sector.

Additionally, raising awareness campaigns to
educate the population about the benefits
of alternative mobile wallets is crucial.
Rwanda successfully boosted the adoption of
services like Airtel Money and MTN Rwanda
by organizing targeted outreach programs,
particularly in rural areas. Finally, financial
incentives, such as reduced transaction fees, can
play a key role in encouraging the adoption of
these solutions. Kenya has effectively used this
approach to promote digital services, thereby
driving their widespread adoption.

By combining these strategies, it would
be possible to diversify the mobile wallet
offerings and strengthen financial inclusion in
underserved regions.

14

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
We recommend to the policymaker to advocate for a multi-pronged approach to boost the
visibility of these lesser-known mobile wallet providers like Ejara and Sara.

First, leveling the playing field through
regulatory frameworks that promote
healthy competition is essential. This
would include ensuring that telecom-
based providers don’t monopolize
infrastructure like mobile networks,
allowing for equal access to critical
resources for all players.

Second, public-private partnerships
could be initiated to create a national
financial literacy campaign, targeting
both urban and rural areas, to raise
awareness of the benefits of non-
traditional mobile wallets. This was
successful in Ghana, where collaborations
between government and fintech led
to a broader understanding of digital
finance among the population, increasing
adoption of multiple service providers.

Third, we would encourage tax incentives
or subsidies for fintech startups that focus
on financial inclusion and innovation.
For example, Nigeria’s fintech ecosystem
has benefited from such support, leading
to a surge in adoption of local digital
financial solutions. Additionally, sandbox
environments where these fintech companies
can test their products under less stringent
regulations could facilitate innovation, much
like the model in Singapore.

Finally, there could be a push for open
banking frameworks, where data-sharing
policies allow for seamless integration
between different financial institutions and
mobile wallets. This would ensure that users
have more flexibility in choosing providers
based on service quality and cost, not just
convenience.

By adopting these measures, we could foster a dynamic and competitive mobile wallet
ecosystem that not only increases financial inclusion but also empowers consumers with
choice

Challenges Faced By Mobile
Money Users By Region

Survey respondents in different regions highlighted several challenges when
using mobile financial services, particularly in rural areas. The most common
problems include poor network coverage, high transaction fees, and lack
of access to mobile devices. These issues are more prevalent in regions
like the East and North-West, where digital and financial infrastructure is
underdeveloped. Addressing these challenges is key to closing the financial
inclusion gap between regions.

16

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
Proposition And
Creating The
Financial Inclusion
Indictor (ISIF)

To enhance financial inclusion in
Cameroon, a holistic and integrated
approach is essential, taking into
account the country’s geographical,
social, and economic challenges. An
innovative proposal involves improving
the infrastructure of “Digital Houses”
dedicated to tontines by making them
autonomous in terms of energy and
education. This initiative could be
spearheaded by major telecom players
like MTN and Orange, who would benefit
from increased adoption of their mobile
services in underserved areas.

Integrating renewable energy solutions
into these Digital Houses will address
one of the primary barriers to financial
inclusion in rural and semi-urban areas:
limited access to electricity. Through
solar-powered autonomous systems,
these infrastructures would not only
serve as financial centers but also as
digital education hubs, offering training
on the use of mobile wallets and
basic financial management. This dual
function of energy and education would
strengthen the economic resilience of
communities, reduce regional disparities,
and encourage the adoption of digital
financial services.

The methodology we developed, based
on the presence of Mobile Wallet Sale/
Withdrawal Points in crisis areas, reveals an
often-overlooked dimension of financial
inclusion. The geographic analysis of
crises and financial flows shows that
even in remote regions where traditional
banking infrastructure is absent, mobile
wallet transactions continue to occur.
This observation suggests a “geostrategic
likelihood” that where a crisis occurs,
a certain level of digital financial
infrastructure is already in place, enabling
the continuity of economic transactions
even under adverse conditions.

Cameroon, with its geographical diversity,
requires a differentiated strategy that
considers local dynamics. In urban and
semi-urban areas, investments should focus
on expanding digital financial services to
capture the massive and often informal
financial flows. In rural areas, the focus
should be on establishing autonomous
infrastructures such as Digital Houses,
combining renewable energy with
financial education. This approach not
only addresses immediate transactional
needs but also prepares these populations
for broader integration into the national
financial system.

17

UNDP Report Accelerator Lab
By adopting a geostrategic approach, leveraging analytical data to identify hidden opportunities in
underserved areas, and promoting autonomous infrastructures for digital financial services, Cameroon can
make significant progress in financial inclusion. This strategy, supported by actors like MTN and Orange, can
not only strengthen economic resilience but also transform the country’s geographical dynamics, deeply
integrating rural and semi-urban populations into the digital economy.

18

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
3.1 Context
Of Financial
Inclusion In
Cameroon

In Cameroon, the emergence of mobile financial services such as MTN
Mobile Money and Orange Money has redefined access to formal financial
systems, especially for underserved populations. Financial inclusion,
driven by mobile wallets, has been an essential enabler for enhancing
economic participation across various regions. While these services have
expanded rapidly, they have not reached all population segments equally,
with certain groups facing significant barriers due to factors such as
regional disparities, gender, education, and access to technology. These
insights, highlighted in the literature review, call for a robust, data-driven
indicator to measure financial inclusion across these diverse groups.

3.2 Defining
The Financial
Inclusion
Indicator (ISIF)

The indicator of Financial Inclusion (ISIF) is designed to capture the level
of access to mobile financial services across various demographic and
geographic dimensions. Its purpose is to create a comprehensive measure
that allows for comparability across regions, age groups, genders, and
occupations, reflecting the actual state of financial inclusion in Cameroon.
The ISIF aggregates various aspects of financial inclusion such as:

3.3
Methodology

Access to Mobile Money Services: Whether individuals use mobile
money services like MTN Mobile Money or Orange Money.
Service Diversity: The number of distinct mobile financial services an
individual uses (such as transfers, payments, and savings).
Sociodemographic Factors: Variables such as age, gender, education,
occupation, and region that contribute to the overall level of inclusion.

This indicator enables policymakers and stakeholders to identify key gaps
in financial inclusion, ensuring that interventions are better targeted, and
progress is monitored effectively.

The ISIF was constructed using a multivariable approach that integrates
categorical and numerical data, making use of techniques such as one-
hot encoding for categorical variables. The process of creating the ISIF
involves:
Normalizing financial services usage by calculating the extent to which
an individual uses mobile financial services relative to the maximum
number of services available.
Measuring the diversity of services used, normalizing this value between
0 and 1 to account for service engagement across multiple categories.
Combining financial services usage and service diversity into a single
composite index that serves as the ISIF.

The following section outlines the specific steps involved in constructing
the indicator.

19

UNDP Report Accelerator Lab
3.4 Construction Of The ISIF

The ISIF is built upon multiple components, each reflecting different aspects of financial inclusion.
The formula for the ISIF is as follows:

where:
K is the Number of variables (such as access to services, age, gender, region etc.).
w_k is the Weight assigned to the k-th variable.
I_kis the contribution of the k-th variable to the indicator

To ensure the contributions of each variable are balanced, the eigenvalues of each variable are
normalized using the following formula:

This normalization step ensures fairness and comparability between different variables, producing
an indicator that reflects true financial inclusion levels.
The final Indicator of Financial Inclusion (ISIF) is scaled between 0 and 1 to facilitate easy
interpretation and comparability across different demographic groups:

where:
I_(i,j) is the calculated value of the indicator for individual i for modality j.
I_min∧I_max are the minimum and maximum values of the indicator.

Each variable can be converted into a binary indicator depending on the presence or absence of a
particular modality. For example, mobile money usage can be represented as:

This binarization simplifies the inclusion of categorical variables in the model.

20

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
3.5 Application
Of The ISIF To
Survey Data

In practice, the ISIF was calculated using data collected from a survey
conducted in Cameroon. The indicator integrates multiple variables
representing the diversity of mobile financial services and user
engagement across different demographic segments.

Access to Mobile Money Services: Usage of mobile financial services like
MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money was a key variable.
Service Diversity: The number of distinct financial services (e.g., fund
transfers, payments, savings) was measured and normalized.
Sociodemographic Variables: Age, gender, occupation, education level,
region, and mobile technology access were included to capture financial
inclusion across different population groups

3.6 Results And Visualization Of ISIF By
Demographic Features

The ISIF model was applied to analyze financial inclusion trends across several
dimensions, including region, age, gender, and occupation. Below are the key
findings:

3.6.1 ISIF Across Regions
The Center region (0.23) and the Littoral region (0.13) show the highest ISIF
scores, while regions like the North, East, and Far North exhibit much lower levels
of financial inclusion.

This reflects the reality that urban regions, where infrastructure is better developed, offer better
access to financial services. The ISIF confirms that financial inclusion is linked to the availability
of financial infrastructure, underscoring the importance of investments in digital and banking
infrastructure in underdeveloped regions. Also, digital mobile wallets have proven their relevance
even in difficult or crises related context as an effective means of reaching out to vulnerable
populations or individuals in need. A technology which could very well be leveraged by
international organizations and others working with disadvantaged communities.

21

UNDP Report Accelerator Lab
3.6.2 ISIF by Age
Young adults aged 26 to 35 exhibit the highest financial inclusion, with an ISIF score of 0.38,
followed by the 18 to 25 age group at 0.24. Older age groups, particularly those above 45, have
significantly lower scores. This trend illustrates that younger adults are more inclined to use financial
services, particularly mobile services, compared to older demographics.

This aligns with existing literature that suggests younger populations are more comfortable with
mobile technology and digital financial services. The indicator demonstrates a positive relationship
between age and financial service adoption among younger individuals, which is consistent with
trends observed in other developing markets.

3.6.3 ISIF by Gender
Men have an ISIF score of 0.46, which is notably higher than that of women, at 0.28. This indicates
that men experience higher levels of financial inclusion than women.

These results highlight the gender disparities in access to financial services in Cameroon, as
suggested by existing studies. The ISIF underscores a significant gender gap in financial service
adoption, emphasizing the need for targeted programs to enhance financial inclusion for women.

22

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
3.6.4 ISIF by Geographic Zone
Urban areas show an ISIF score of 0.47, which is significantly higher than rural areas at 0.09.

This confirms that rural areas are often underserved in terms of financial services. The ISIF highlights
the need for mobile financial services and rural-specific solutions to bridge this gap and improve
financial inclusion in these areas.

3.6.5 ISIF by Occupation
The relatively high financial inclusion among students (ISIF 0.26) compared to the unemployed (ISIF
0.09) reflects key trends in mobile money usage and financial access. Students, often tech-savvy and
familiar with digital platforms, benefit significantly from the convenience and immediacy of mobile
wallets. In contrast to previous methods where families had to queue at services like Express Union,
facing long wait times and potential connection issues, mobile money has transformed the way
households provide financial support to their children away from home.

Parents can now send money effortlessly, and students can access these funds instantly, highlighting
a shift toward more efficient and inclusive financial ecosystems. This contrasts sharply with the
unemployed, who often lack stable income sources, thereby limiting their ability to engage in
regular transactions through mobile money platforms. The trend underscores the critical role of
employment and income stability in driving financial inclusion, as well as the growing relevance of
mobile technology in addressing practical financial challenges.

23

UNDP Report Accelerator Lab
3.6.6 ISIF by Education Level
Holders of a Master’s degree (0.33) and a Bachelor’s degree (0.21) have the highest financial
inclusion, while individuals with lower education levels, such as secondary education, have much
lower ISIF scores.

These results align with the established link between education and financial inclusion. Education
plays a crucial role in gaining access to financial services and effectively understanding and utilizing
these services.

3.6.7 ISIF by Marital Status
Single individuals (0.57) are the most financially included, while married (0.16) and divorced
individuals (0.01) have significantly lower scores.

This may be attributed to the differing financial responsibilities of single individuals versus those
in unions. Singles may be more likely to use digital financial services to manage their finances
independently.

24

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage as a Catalyst for Financial Inclusion in Cameroon
3.6.8 ISIF by Phone and Smartphone Ownership
Phone and smartphone ownership significantly correlates with financial inclusion. Individuals with
smartphones have an ISIF score of 0.7, while those without smartphones score much lower (0.04).

This clearly demonstrates the critical role of mobile technology in promoting financial inclusion.
Individuals with smartphones have far greater access to financial services, proving that access to
technology is a key factor in inclusion.

3.6.9 ISIF by Mobile Network Access
Individuals with access to a mobile network exhibit a significantly higher ISIF score of 0.72 compared
to those without network access, who have an almost negligible score of 0.01.

This illustrates the importance of mobile network infrastructure in financial inclusion. The disparity
reflects the crucial role of mobile networks as gateways to mobile financial services. This is consistent
with the wider literature on the necessity of telecommunications infrastructure for fostering financial
inclusion, especially in low- and middle-income countries where mobile-based services drive access
to banking.

3.6.10 ISIF by Internet Access
The ISIF score for individuals with internet access is 0.73, while for those without internet access, the
score falls drastically to 0.01.

This highlights the direct correlation between internet accessibility and financial inclusion. As
internet penetration expands, so does the ability to use mobile financial services. This is a strong
signal that further investment in digital infrastructure could be key to bridging the financial
inclusion gap. The internet facilitates not only access but also the regular usage of financial
platforms, enhancing the diversity of services available to users.

3.6.11 ISIF by Mobile Money Services
Individuals who use mobile money services have an ISIF score of 0.71, compared to a minimal score
of 0.03 for those who do not use such services.

The stark contrast in ISIF scores underlines the transformative impact of mobile money services on
financial inclusion in Cameroon. This trend is emblematic of the mobile-first financial landscape that
has emerged in many developing nations, where formal banking services remain limited. Mobile
money provides a lower barrier to entry, offering users a gateway to formal financial systems, which
is reflected in the high ISIF scores.

3.6.12 ISIF by Mobile Money Services are Used
Fund transfers generate the highest ISIF score (0.55), followed by paying for services (0.14), while
savings services contribute a very low score (0.05).

The high ISIF score for fund transfers suggests that mobile money is predominantly used for
remittances and peer-to-peer transactions in Cameroon. The relatively low scores for other services
highlight an opportunity for financial service providers to diversify offerings, such as savings and
investment options, which remain underutilized. This aligns with the findings in literature which
stress the need to expand the functionality of mobile financial services beyond basic transfers.

3.6.13 ISIF by Key Challenges Problem Category
The key challenge of network availability garners the highest ISIF score (0.22), followed by the “other”
category (0.16), while challenges related to costs, service, and availability are much lower on the ISIF
scale.

Network issues appear to be a primary bottleneck in financial inclusion, indicating that infrastructure
challenges persist as a critical barrier. Addressing these challenges could lead to substantial
improvements in financial access. The diverse categories under “other” may suggest unique,
localized challenges that need to be explored further. The low scores for cost-related problems
indicate that while financial services may be accessible, affordability continues to be a limiting factor
for broader inclusion.

3.6.14 ISIF by Key Challenges Sentiment
Users with a neutral sentiment towards key challenges have the highest ISIF score of 0.38, while
those with positive sentiments show an exceptionally low score (0.04).

The low ISIF score for users with positive sentiment towards financial services challenges indicates
that individuals who are content with their financial service options may already be included or have
limited engagement with additional financial products. Those with neutral or negative sentiments
are likely to encounter challenges but remain engaged in the hope of improvement, suggesting that
efforts to address user pain points could significantly boost financial inclusion.

3.6.15 ISIF by Suggestion Category
The ISIF score is highest (0.24) for individuals who suggest improvements in areas outside the
typical categories, followed by network improvements (0.20) and cost reduction (0.18). Suggestions
regarding security, expansion, and service improvement register very low scores (0.01 each).

This suggests that network reliability and service costs are the primary factors limiting financial
inclusion. The emphasis on “other” suggests there are unaddressed concerns not captured by
traditional categories, which may point to the need for more localized solutions. While security
and service improvement are important, they seem to be secondary considerations compared to
infrastructure and affordability challenges.

Conclusion

The Financial Inclusion Indicator (ISIF) constructed
from this dataset provides a detailed analysis of
the disparities in financial access and usage across
different demographic and geographic segments in
Cameroon. Significant gaps persist, particularly across
age, gender, and regional lines, with urban areas,
younger populations, and individuals with higher
education levels experiencing stronger financial
inclusion.

These findings indicate the need for targeted
interventions, especially in rural areas and among
underrepresented groups such as women and older
populations. Expanding mobile network coverage and
internet access would be critical to improving financial
inclusion, as reflected in the ISIF scores.

Moreover, encouraging broader use of
mobile financial services, beyond basic
transfers to more advanced services such as
savings and investments, is essential.

This ISIF analysis supports the existing
body of research that highlights the role
of technology in enhancing financial
inclusion. However, it also underscores
ongoing challenges related to infrastructure
and affordability, indicating that a
comprehensive approach—encompassing
technological, educational, and regulatory
strategies—is essential for achieving full
financial inclusion in Cameroon.

Policy recommandations includes :
Fostering competition by reducing entry barriers for smaller providers like Ejara and Sara.
Promoting interoperability to enhance accessibility across different mobile wallet platforms.
Offering tax incentives to encourage fintech innovations that target underserved communities.
Encouraging public-private partnerships to drive the adoption of mobile financial services in rural
areas.
Implementing digital literacy programs to build trust and foster a deeper understanding of new
financial services.
