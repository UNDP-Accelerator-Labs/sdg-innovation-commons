## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Securing national exams in Guinea Education System
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the intention of the ministries in charge of education, through national exams, is to sanction the level of learning of students annually, which then makes it possible to establish a filter of the best. Taking into account the realities of our country where no coherent database exists for both the students in situation and the supervisors, the examination papers are written from which we most often receive the echoes of flight before the date of the tests, to reasons not mastered…. Thus, in an indescribable hubbub, uncontrolled budgeting is imposed. Which is finally a real problem to the government.  So, Our job will be to learn and see how we could support to facilitate the implementation of a system to ensure that exams are held in a secure environment with the ultimate goal of indisputable results.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

For several years, the Guinean examination system has been confronted with numerous cases of fraud resulting from the fact that, from the writing (composition) of the subjects, the holding of the exams through to the correction and dissemination of the results, certain parameters escape from the vigilance of the organizers. Several annual evaluations have seen the clandestine use of mobile phones, the substitution of candidates by people paid for the task, supervisors who abandon classrooms. During the corrections, several cases of contested marks, correctors although performing well, have always been the subject of criticism aimed at tarnishing the credibility of the results. The organization of the 2020 baccalaureate exams confirmed that the number of students was not under control; i.e.: more than 830 candidates did not have the (precedent diploma) BEPC diploma and 46 admitted to the baccalaureate in 2019 were in the list of candidates for 2020 in the hope to have a better rank and thus benefit from a scholarship to study abroad. Faced with this problem, it is a more than urgent appeal that is launched by the authorities for mitigation. Our action is therefore timely insofar as from an innovative point of view, it will be possible to quickly study, understand and propose a solution leading to a better way of taking exams.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This question makes sense in that the CO has already received a call for action from the government through the Ministry of Education. The most important resource of a country is the Human resources, no country can achieve the real development if there not qualified Human resource. By addressing this issue, AccLabGN will provide faster solution processing. We will be working with networking approach made available by the Global Lab to tackle the situation. We will use our data collection mechanism that allows us to get the deeper understanding of cases. we will comfort the government in its reconquest of good prestige among its citizens by providing it with the means of credibility of the process.
