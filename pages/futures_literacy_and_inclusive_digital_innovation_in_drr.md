## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

(1) Youth and young professionals are at an ideal stage to learn and explore further on future scenarios, having just completing their formal educational background and entering the workforce. By specifically targeting these groups, the 'Futures Thinking in Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience' were able to instill innovative thinking and push the boundaries of discussion towards a new way of approaching disaster mitigation in the forthcoming future (2) As majority of the facilitators and participants came from a 'rigid' background on disaster management, which involved meticulous planning and calculations, disrupting their mental models through introducing new ways of thinking (such as futures thinking and collective imagination) have proven to bring about new perspectives on their daily practices through embracing uncertainties and asking 'what ifs', which in return hopefully will bring ripple effects to their respective practice (3) Through co-design session among the core team, three topics pursued during this one-year initiative: The Future of Disaster Governance, Future of Disaster Knowledge and Future of Human Behaviors and Hazards. Each topic was complemented with differing 'Reframing' scenarios which goes beyond the threshold of possible future, prompting participants to relinquish their anticipatory assumptions and drive the discussion to exploratory points.  (4) There is a clear division of enabling futures 'literacy' and landing it concretely on daily practices. The focus of the 'Futures Thinking in DRR and Resilience' was the former, thus requiring more space to transform it into action. This is a niche where UNDP could tap into with its pioneering work on Foresight. (5) In regards to the DIRECT Project, various ideas were submitted for mobile applications and web-based platforms to further ensure inclusivity in early warning system. Through AccLab's observation, co-creation processes were still to be introduced for participants, however the spirit of collective intelligence and analyzing citizen-led data is already embedded within the many crowdsourced ideas.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, inter-UN-agency collaboration has been more challenging than anticipated with workload division, cooperation among different units within UN (comms, senior management and such). However, in terms of impacting the system, the series of activities achieved its intended targets.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

As intended, pre-surveys were initiated as part of the co-design session to determine the different topics as focus of the 'Futures Thinking in Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience'. The surveys enabled the team to gather insights from 100+ respondents across countries in Asia Pacific on urgent and prioritized topics within DRR, to be later discussed and triangulated. Throughout the different activities - webinars, futures literacy labs/participatory workshops, public dialogues - engagement with local/regional youth were maintained as part of the main target participants of the events. This strategic choice validated the team's intention in influencing future leaders to embrace new ways of thinking in their respective areas. As facilitators, we conducted participatory observation to gather insights on thought processes, discussion flows, debates and summary development from each group (one Futures Literacy Labs consists of an estimated 30 participants) as part of the results to be adopted into a major report in Global Platform for DRR in 2022.  Meanwhile, for the DIRECT Project, the Lab participated in the Hackathon to build upon the CO's existing initiative on mobile-based early warning system. The focus of the Hackathon is to crowdsource ideas for mobile application and web-based platforms that highlights inclusivity (gender, PwD, youth and children). Mentoring process throughout the Hackathon were crucial in developing the participants' ideas and testing their assumptions, where AccLab advocated the use of Collective Intelligence, that were later integrated in their proposals.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

As there were many topics to focus on within DRR, co-creation processes with the core team were crucial in determining the path forward. These co-creation sessions enabled the team to understand the gaps and opportunities in youth and young professionals across Asia Pacific, their concerns and aspirations, current mental models as well as reach a consensus on call for participants approaches (closed and open calls, through nominations, etc), DRR topics, flow of events and many more technical details. Meanwhile, as participants utilize different futuring tools - such as Futures Triangle, Collective Imagination - they were establishing and exercising their foresight capabilities. Meanwhile tools such as the Causal Layered Analysis enabled participants to conduct a future analysis, whereby a deeper investigation on their anticipatory assumptions were practiced. As a group exercise, they collectively build a narrative on their probable, desirable and reframed futures, as a reflection of collective intelligence in practice. Lastly, a Hackathon form of engagement was chosen by the DIRECT Project as a way to crowdsource ideas and understand better the gaps of existing government-established early warning system, particularly for its inclusivity. Through the ideas proposed, government stakeholders were able to identify the rooms for improvement in including women, children and PwD as part of its broad user segment in pursuit of accessibility for all.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

U-Inspire Alliance - to co-develop and implement ‘Futures Thinking in DRR’ project (conduct project scoping, planning, Training of Trainers (ToT) for futures thinking and foresight, socialization, facilitation, moderation and reporting)

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

U-Inspire Alliance were already working with the DIRECT Project and now is involved actively in the 'Futures Thinking in DRR and Resilience'. They were adept at mobilizing youth across Asia Pacific with DRR background as main target participants (future leaders) in their respective areas.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNESCO Regional Science Bureau for Asia and the Pacific - to co-develop and implement ‘Futures Thinking in DRR’ project (conduct project scoping, planning, Training of Trainers (ToT) for futures thinking and foresight, socialization, facilitation, moderation and reporting)

 

UNDRR Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific - to provide additional support for 'Futures Thinking in DRR'

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

As this learning cycle was part of the 'Exploratory' challenge, it was imperative to see all the forces at play - exploring what type of resources are available (partners, internal capabilities, existing data sources and gaps for innovative methods) and take a step back to formulate a meaningful series of activities. After a rigorous trust building process with partners and hours of brainstorming, a one-year 'Futures Thinking in DRR and Resilience' was established, with multiple engagements (webinars, participatory workshops, public dialogues) that is growing organically and has initiated a discourse of innovation within youth and young professionals across Asia Pacific. Without the necessary prototyping and co-creation processes (as well as flexibility and enthusiasm from partners), it would not have been possible to set course a massive ripple effect from its inception phase back in December 2021. The multiple engagements have bring about many learnings (theoretically, pragmatically) that even the Lab is still struggling to collate and disseminate - which is a good thing and could hopefully contribute to the sector even more.
