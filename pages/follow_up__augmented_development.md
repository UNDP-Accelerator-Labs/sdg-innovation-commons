## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. The main Intent of the Augmented Development Action Plan has been to explore how the use of technologies can enhance empathy with the “otherness”, helping us to close mental and social gaps, hence improving human development.

2. At this phase of the project, we developed the third version of the AR platform. At this stage we explore with several functionalities based on GPS services and improved the front end and back end of the platform to improve the upload of content, but also its use.

3. We found that there is a lot of interest from national and regional institutions in the possibilities of such technology to enhance transparency in public use of resources.

4. The AR and VR solutions have been used in other projects of the Lab and UNDP, such as the launch of the HDR in 2019, the creation of a crowdfunding platform to gather resources for the recovery of Providence Island, after Iota hurricane passed by it in 2021. In 2023 will be used to enhance the onboarding process of UNDP in Colombia.

5. In 2023 we will have a “Product Launch” to show to the hole UNDP the capabilities of the solution to connect with projects and users where it could add value.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

This is the third version of the app, and the main bottle neck that we found was that the initial provider (versions 1 and 2) didn´t have the full capacity as was expected at the beginning of the project, therefore the expected functionalities and performance of the app was nod the ideal in order to be a product that could be used by the CO or our allies in the government. We where able for this version to work hand by hand with a local AR and VR provider which was able to define with us the product as we had envisioned it and to guide our design process.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Since this app is intended to create empathy, at the current version is mostly focused on the display on content, rather than the data collection. However, it relies on geospatial and georeferenced data used in the app to display specific information. For the next steps of this project we intend to deploy tools to assess how the use of AR and VR can enhance the empathy creation.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Augmented reality: The main element to use the app is the camera. When the app is being used, the camera will work as a reader of what is being displayed. What the user will see in their screen is their mobile device camera. Using what in AR is called “triggers” the user can point at an image / graphic or to a specific element and a video / image or 3d model will appear. Behavioral science: using behavioural science, we will trigger a direct conversation with someone from location or context.  This interaction will change people’s mindset on what the context / world / cosmogenesis means for them. Human centered design: We have designed the app from a human centered approach, focusing on the user experience so the app can satisfy peoples need in an easy way. Prototyping: This is the third iteration of the app we have so far. The new proposed version will be an iteration on the learnings and findings we had on the initial prototype and new features we have foreseen as valuable to our CO projects and government.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Perspektiva: A young enterprise that is helping us build our AD app infrastructure and platform with experience in the technology sector and an emphasis on the development of mobile platforms and immersive products.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Comission of Truth (Comisión de la Verdad): In an event with businesses from people who where part of the peace agreements, they used the app to share stories of how the lifes of people had changed thanks to this agreements, and its implementation.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Perspektiva

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

NA

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
