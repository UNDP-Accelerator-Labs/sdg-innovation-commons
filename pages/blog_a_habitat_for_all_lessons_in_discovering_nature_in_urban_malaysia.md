A HABITAT FOR ALL: LESSONS IN DISCOVERING NATURE IN URBAN MALAYSIA
Five lessons for biodiverse and resilient cities

Through the Di Sekitar Kita (‘Around Us’) Urban Biodiversity Challenge we (re)discovered nature in urban Malaysia, and explored the relationship between people and wildlife that live in our towns and cities.
Drawing from what we learned, we present five lessons for biodiverse and resilient cities:
Green space matters, but how it is distributed matters more.
Better distribution of green space increases accessibility and brings nature closer to us, but this is a double-edged sword—more integrated green space may cause conflict.
Cities are a gateway to understanding and appreciating the complexity of biodiversity and ecosystems.
Citizen science is a great way to (re)discover and reconcile with nature.
Beyond protecting existing green space, we must create new ones—hand in hand with people and nature.
