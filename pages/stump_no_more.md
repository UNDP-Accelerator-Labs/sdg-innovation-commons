Tree stump removal works is a global issue whereby the stumps that are not removed completely can cause accidents, tarnish the scenery and increases the difficulty in planting new tree plants. For example, in 2014, a motorbike rider became victim to a tree stump after hitting it.  There have been various methods that remove tree stumps that involve the use of machineries that are costly. However, the operation of the machineries also require high costs. To overcome this, the Legendary Group, composed of officers in the National Landscape Department and Hulu Selangor Municipal Council, took the initiative to create STUMP-NO-MORE. STUMP-NO-MORE functions as a stump remover. The equipment is made from recycled materials such as drum tin, scrap metal and used items easily obtained and of low value. Based on the portable concept, the equipment is easy to be moved from one place to another, requiring only 2 handlers.  Using STUMP-NO-MORE saves up to 80% of operating costs compared to conventional tree stump removal techniques. The equipment completely and cleanly removes tree stumps, leaving behind an ash-filled hole that can be refilled with soil and then flattened. The hole left behind can be used to plant new plants, easing the landscaping process at an effective cost. This innovation is patented with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MYIPO).
