A local community in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands has adapted to the effects of climate change. Due to the rise in sea level, the roads along the coast are heavily affected. At present, the men of this community have utilized their local knowledge and skills to construct this seawall. Also, the men are using cement to keep the rocks intact to provide a high degree of protection from coastal flooding and erosion.
