While Fiji was under lockdown due to the COVID19 pandemic, local artists took to social media platforms such as Facebook (Facebook live) and Twitter (Twitter spaces) to host virtual concerts as a means to raise money for themselves and for those most affected by the pandemic. Donations were made by viewers who were based in Fiji, as well as the Fijian diaspora in many other countries.
