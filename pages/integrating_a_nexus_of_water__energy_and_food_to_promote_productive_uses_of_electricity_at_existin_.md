> Title of the innovation

Integrating a Nexus of Water, Energy and Food to Promote Productive Uses of Electricity at Existing Solar Milling Plants in Rural Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Using the excess power generation capacity from the existing 1580 solar milling plants, the Rural Electrification Authority in collaboration with Zambia Cooperative Federation and respective Cooperatives, will develop and design site-specific technical solutions that will ensure proper utilisation of excess solar energy from the solar milling plants. These solutions will include development of distribution lines to evacuate the excess electricity from the solar milling plants to the targeted beneficiaries; development of energy storage solutions for the excess electricity; as well as providing technical support in undertaking the environmental impact assessments for all the plant sites. The ultimate goal for this collaborative project proposal is to unlock the potential by milling plants to provide other value-added services such as lighting, water pumping, irrigation, entertainment, telecommunication, internet and banking services. These services will enable communities around the plants to engage in productive uses of electricity that allow them to generate income which will in turn transform their living standards. The project aims at designing of an optimized integrated business model for the sustainable operation of existing solar milling plants in Zambia and enhancement of local community socio-economic growth through provision of a nexus solution involving water, energy and food (WEF).

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project idea adopts an innovative business model by deviating from the tradition way of selling electricity in kWhs but selling of the service such as light, refrigeration, cooking/heating and water pumping. This is in a bid to ensure that energy efficient measures are incorporated in the project and that many people can benefit from power generated by a small mini grid. For the reasons outlined above, the project will promote the use of Energy as a Service (EaaS) business model using the Pay as you Go (PAYGO) approach in the billing system. The EaaS model offers various energy-related services to the consumers, rather than only supplying electricity. The project will adopt a usage-based payment PAYGO model where the customers will be allowed to load money onto a prepaid meter and use the amount of electricity for the appliances paid for which corresponds to the amount of money paid. Once the period lapses, electricity supply will be turned off automatically through a remotely managed control system until the next payment is made. The innovation leads to value addition on the environmental through improvements in indoor air quality at local scale and reduction in carbon emissions from decreased use of kerosene.

> Technical Feasibility

After extensive stakeholder engagement, Chitumba Solar Milling Plant (SMP) in Kampekete Village of Chongwe was selected as a candidate pilot project. A review of the existing installation at the Chitumba SMP was made to assesses the excess generation emanating from the current system. Further, the proposed demand emanating from the community load survey conducted by REA and the author were established. Thereafter, a configuration was designed that strived to meet  the proposed community demand which includes 88 households, 9 businesses, 2 social institutions and 1 water pumping system. A load-curve (x-axis: daily hours in 1h intervals vs. y-axis: power demand) for each customer group was developed, as well as a final (cumulative) daily load curve for all customers. Based on this load curve, the average daily and monthly energy demand was estimated for all your customers. The load curves were needed to model the demand supply match using excel and Homerpro software. This helped to estimate the average electricity consumption and respective revenues for the innovation. Details of the technical feasibility are presented in section 5 of the attached project proposal. Sustainable implementation will include technical assistance, awareness-raising, access to finance, gender equality, social inclusion and promoting an enabling environment.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There are a lot of socio-economic benefits that would be brought about by upscaling the utilization of excess power from the solar milling plants. Some specific benefits include: 
a)	Better-quality lighting enabling extended hours of study for school pupils at night and teachers also have adequate time to prepare their lessons in the evenings.
b)	The availability of electricity will allow for the use of communication devices such as mobile phones thereby improving access to Information and Communication Technology in rural areas.
c)	Reduced health risks associated with Green House Gas emissions as a result of conventional forms of energy.
d)	The availability of electricity will make it possible for connected households to store perishable foodstuffs, chill drinking water and soft drinks using refrigerators.
This project will contribute to accelerating the implementation of the activities identified in the Seventh National Development Plan whose goal is to create a diversified and resilient economy for sustained growth and socio-economic transformation. Hence, the project will contribute to economic diversification, poverty, and vulnerability reduction, reduced developmental inequalities and enhanced human development as the economic and social wellbeing of citizens in the rural areas are expected to improve with increased access to electricity.
