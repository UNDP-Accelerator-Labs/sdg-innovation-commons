**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Javier Brolo and Juan Pablo Rustrián 



> On date (Day/Month/Year)

September 31th, 2022



> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Co-creation of waste management solutions.



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to improve the collaboration between society and public institutions to increase resilience to climate change



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How to improve waste management



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector
- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

UNDP Office, Local Governments, Municipalities, Ministries and NGOs related to environmental care and Waste Management, Schools, and Universities; or any sector that wants to promote best practices aimed at circular economy through communication campaigns.


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to know if the use of communication campaigns could help to promote good practices aimed at circular economy. 



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we hold conversations with campaign implementers, then we can quickly obtain references of successful campaigns in Guatemala.



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment
- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Interviews were conducted with implementers of communication campaigns in Guatemala, who offered some examples of ways in which they've tried to promote best practices.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The implementers of communication campaigns.



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Interviews.



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 week.



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time to make the interviews and gather the information.


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven. Interviewing campaigns implementers gave us a good reference about successful campaigns in Guatemala aimed at circular economy within one week. 



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We would like to interview more implementers and once we have the references make a couple of campaigns using them.



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

About 1 week.



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00.



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The idea of getting these references is to make a good communication campaign to promote better practices aimed at circular economy.



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, the environmental programmatic unit from the UNDP Office is planning to create content focused on better practices aimed at circular economy.



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment led to partnerships
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We learned about successful communication campaigns considerations, that will help us to understand how to create a good campaign. Additionally, it is suggested how we can evaluate how good or not the campaigns are.



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Coordinating time to do the interviews

and gathering notes from unstructured conversations. Also, for the conversation

we invited interviews to eat a couple of times, but there is no easy way to get

reimbursed for this kind of spending. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All UNDP projects could benefit from incorporating some advice about making good communication campaigns.



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Institutions or those who need the tools to make a good communication campaign based on circular economy or any other topics.



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, with each interview, we were able to learn how to guide the conversation in a more fluid and relevant manner. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

We would recommend focusing not

just on the good advice from implementers but also on those campaigns that did

not work and learn from the past too. Also, there might be unrecognized costs

associated with this kind of scouting. Moreover, it's very important to share

back with interviewed people the document reporting so it doesn't become an

extractive practice.



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely. We could use these resources to create campaigns not just on circular economy or waste management topics. We just need to make interviews, gather the information, and finally scale de campaigns.



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This experiment came from the environmental programmatic unit at UNDP office. Solutions Mapping and Exploration could use theses feedback to their defined topics of interest.



> What surprised you?

We are surprised about the ways implementers make campaigns and how much they've learned from the past.  They need to build alliances to spread within communities and be complemented with more engaging activities. Also, most campaigns in Guatemala have struggled with the fragmented and stratified nature of Guatemala's society, making it difficult to construct narratives that are widely recognized.
