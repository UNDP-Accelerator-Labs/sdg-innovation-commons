Strengthening the Birth Registration System in Samoa
APRIL 19, 2023
Birth registration is a fundamental right, recognized by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and often forms the basis for the achievement of many other rights, including, but not limited to, the right to health and the right to education. Birth registration and related information are also key in ensuring effective development planning which benefits all, especially in a country like Samoa which remains increasingly vulnerable to disasters.
