A team of young innovators in Bangladesh have developed a central nebulizer that can run without electricity, which is crucial for treating patients in emergencies since frequent power outages is a major challenge in energy starved Bangladesh, particularly in the rural areas. It has a reserve chamber that can provide oxygen until the reserve is emptied or power supply is back on. These are also useful in emergencies such as during floods and other natural disasters, which are increasing in Bangladesh due to climate change. Moreover, it can support upto 30 patients at a time and is the cheapest commercial nebulizer system in Bangladesh.
