## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

In July 2021, Mauritius was classified as a high-income developing country by the World Bank, which changes the development landscape for the country (operationally and financially). When working on the tourism-related frontier challenge, this context highlighted a few interesting insights: financing development solutions will be harder than anticipated yet development challenges linked to tourism exist. We have seen this when conducting sensemaking exercises in parts of the coastal regions that were struggling with inactivity due to low tourist arrivals, the new generation is reluctant to seek work in tourism, etc.,  The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the economic fabric of Mauritius and Seychelles. To solve the major issues that we now face, we need to be as innovative as possible while being inclusive. We need to be able to bring everyone who can contribute something to the table together and find ways to break silos and forge multidisciplinary teams of experts in the tourism sector and other sectors, which does not currently exist.  The Republic of Mauritius is seeking to address new market segments for tourism, notably digital nomads and silver-haired tourists. The latter segment staying for longer periods. For both segments, Mauritius will need to provide additional products and services and adapt existing services and products to new and changing needs. Both market segments will need an inclusive, eco-friendly and resilient tourism ecosystem.  While speaking with people leading/working with MSMEs, we realised that there is a huge gap in knowledge when it comes to financial literacy, which is an important aspect of running a business, especially micro and small enterprises. This insight has led us to develop a financial literacy experiment with women-led micro-enterprises, which will be one of the focus areas for 2022 for our Lab. We will shortly identify an educational partner to run the experiment with. As part of this experiment, we want to test new pedagogy, and test hybrid learning mechanisms that promote flexibility while answering the needs of the cohort of micro-enterprises we will experiment with.  The COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call for many Small Island Nations to re-imagine their tourism industry practices and models. Along our journey mapping the ecosystem of MSMEs in the tourism sector across Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles through our collective intelligence exercises, we witnessed a strong resilience among these unusual actors, to sustain their livelihoods and to re-invent this industry for a greener recovery. The pandemic has revealed much social and economic vulnerabilities, but we found numerous opportunities for learning and sharing across islands. This is why Acc Lab recruited our UN Community Volunteers and we are in the process of building the Grassroots Innovation Database for Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

COVID-19 and local sanitary protocols meant that we could not go to speak to communities in person.  Travel restrictions meant we could only really focus on Mauritius. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Available data is largely focused on large players in the local tourism value chain. There was little data available on small actors such as Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Our data collection methods were centred on the human touch, we talked to people in person for long periods of time and used participatory observation too. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Given our Lab's focus on the human-centred approach, we needed to build trust with the communities we were talking to. These innovation methods were the most apt for our needs and meant that we could really unpack what was happening on the ground. To be noted that 1 in 8 persons is employed by the tourism industry directly in Mauritius and indirectly, it is more. This means that the system we are unpacking is quite complex. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the GEF Small Grants Programme(SGP) beneficiaries, and some are of them are registered CSOs. We worked with Kolektif Rivier Nwar, Maison Familiale Rurales, Outgrowing, Centre de Formation Agricole de Frère Remy (Rodrigues) and Citizen Engagement Platform (CEP - Seychelles).  With these CSOs, we worked collaboratively to conduct interviews and surveys as many of them were working directly and indirectly in the local tourism ecosystem. They provided us with further insights into and connections to communities they were working with, which helped our sensemaking, exploration and solutions mapping. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

As we are not closing the Frontier Challenge and will continue to work on tourism in 2022, we already started conversations with several local academic partners to work with us on a financial literacy experiment for MSMEs (15 women-led micro enterprises). We will go through a procurement process to procure an academic institution to partner with us on this experiment early this year. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In the first 100 days of our learning cycle, we worked with Business Mauritius (informally) to gather data on COVID-19's impact on businesses in Mauritius. We are also in the process of striking a collaboration with a private sector entity called 'Made in Moris', which comprises of 130+ businesses using local production means and aiming to completely localise supply chains. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Since October 2021, we have been working with the Ministry of Tourism to develop a roadmap for tourism recovery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This collaboration in ongoing and is formalised by a consultancy activity that UNDP is driving. The Accelerator Lab is assisting in this endeavour.  We are also collaborating with the Mauritius Research and Innovation Council (MRIC) with whom we are signing the formal MoU this month (February 2021). 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The Acc Lab has collaborated with the UNDP-ECOFISH project, which is helping local fisher communities to explore new fishing grounds, improve post harvesting processing infrastructure and enhance fish processing techniques.  We see the ECOFISH project and team members as unusual internal partners as we worked together to devise new solutions for the fisher communities. For example, solutions that require use of new technologies. The fisher communities themselves are equally unusual partners as they are traditionally from marginalised communities in Mauritius and are often overlooked in policy decisions.   Our Lab has promoted co-design of new solutions alongside the fisher communities across Mauritius (and soon Rodrigues) by inviting these communities to be part of our Collective Intelligence exercises. Any solutions being sought need the fisher communities to be a core part of them as they are experts in their fields and possess deep understanding of what is possible/feasible while navigating our seas for their livelihoods.  As the Lab focuses on re-imagining and repositioning the local tourism industry, it sees this community as a key part of the process. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Our Lab worked with the Global Centre for Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development in Singapore to design and develop a data collection platform (Kobo Questionnaire) to collect data on grassroots innovators and innovations in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles. This data collection platform is in 3 languages: Creole, French and English to help maximise input from the local community.  We also worked with the UNV (Kenya and HQ) to recruit a cohort of 6 UN Community Volunteers across Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles. We managed to recruit these UNVs, who are now working with the Lab until May 2022 (extendable) to help us with data collection efforts to build a Grassroots Innovation Database (noufitir.org).  UNDP is collaborating with the Digital Public Goods Alliance to constitute a repository of technology solutions (mobile apps, software, etc.,) which can freely be used all over the world. The Acc Lab has facilitated a conversation between the Prime Minister's Office of Mauritius and UNDP/DPGA to discuss the possible inclusion of a mobile app called lespwar that tackles gender-based violence in Mauritius.   Finally, at the start of 2021, our Lab collaborated with the International Organisation for Migration (IoM) on this particular question: How the Mauritian diaspora can be roped in the better defining and examining of national issues, and contributing (in an innovative manner) to the development of solutions?  The aim was to build the capacity of the Mauritian Government to strengthen linkages with the Mauritian Diaspora, contributing to an increased diaspora contribution to the social and economic development of Mauritius and promoting an increased Mauritian diaspora engagement. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Our frontier challenge is complex as tourism touches almost everyone in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles. COVID-19 has impacted the industry globally but Small Island developing States are feeling heavily impacted given their reliance on the industry for jobs and livelihoods. We also understand that the tourism ecosystem is complex due to its formal and informal roots.  As such, to gather the insights and learnings that we did, we had to rely on the interplay of several methods. The key for us was to approach people affected by the pandemic in the tourism sector such as those in MSMEs or leading MSMEs by listening to them and creating a community of trust. Data on tourism is also scant, particularly when it concerns smaller players, who often fall outside of the statistics. This meant we needed to identify them and talk to them. This type of approach is slow burning.
