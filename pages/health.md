> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If empowered with resources i will make sure to educate everyone on the dangers of abusing drugs specifically medicinal drags that people buy in chemists and consume them without the doctors prescription.
      Many people are victims of drug abuse yet they are unaware of it therefore i wish to be empowered and be granted permission to go out there and educate people on this effect.
      My innovation depends on sponsorship from either the government or well wishers whose interest is seeing people living healthy lives as good health may lead to a positive impact as far as development of our country is concerned.

This innovation will also allow a lot of youths to have something to do and earn both knowledge and empowerment.
