> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

It is a sub-contractor of the energy distribution companies in Panama (ENSA and Edemet)

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The island of Chepillo, located 3 km south of the mouth of the Bayano River and made up of more than 255 inhabitants, is illuminated by 123 kW of firm power assembled by 2 Caterpillar DE50 units and a Perkins MP-45. One of ENSA's six isolated 4.16 kV distribution networks is the one that receives energy and power through 37.5 kVA single-phase transformers, brand RYMEL, with a delta-star connection. The 1.7 linear km of territory between end and end are characterized by 112 electricity consumption points and a maximum demand of 75 kW, which is normally reached on May 3, the date on which its devout people celebrate the festivity of the Cross.

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- No

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Proven implementation of product, service or process at scale

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

It has been diffused in 18 isolated areas of Panama. We could get user-feedback, but it is unclear how. 

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

No, but the analysis could be done. 

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Yes, as this solution is deployed under a contract from the distributions company, maybe an expansion would require the navigation of the current contract/national regulations and the capacity of the company to expand. However, the equipment they use is imported, it is not manufactured in Panama.
