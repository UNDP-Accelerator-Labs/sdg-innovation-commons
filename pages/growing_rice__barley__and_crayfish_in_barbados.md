## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

May 6 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Sustainable Agriculture 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Currently, food security is a major challenge in the Caribbean. A study conducted by the Caribbean

Community (CARICOM) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) indicates nearly 4.1 million

people or 57% of the population face food insecurity1. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the

impact a disruption in supply chains in the global market can affect the acquisition of products including food

in the Caribbean.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can a sustainable model be developed to support the growth of rice, barley and cray fish in the

Barbados environment (SIDs Context).

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Experimental (RCTs, etc.)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To determine the feasibility of growing rice and barley supplemented by the raising of cray fish for consumption.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the growing of Rice, Barley and Cray Fish is feasible, this approach can be used to reduce the amount of rice imported as well as it can increase the availability of barley for cereal and cray fish for protein.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Various of varieties of rice and barley and species of cray fish will be identified based on the environmental conditions in Barbados.

An experiment will be designed to test and evaluate the selected varieties and species in various conditions.

 The results attained from the experiment will be used to determine the feasibility of growing rice and barley supplemented by the raising of cray fish for consumption.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Length of time required to grow rice, barley and cray fish

 The amount grown.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation and monitoring of the rice barley and crayfish 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
