## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1-Unlike normal sectors, STEM women don’t pursue green sectors on purpose, it’s them who don’t have the interest, and the reason for that is their lack of knowledge about what’s in it for them. Moreover, they don’t have the needed skills. And since the key for greening the economy, is through empowering women in green sectors, it’s very important to consider equipping them with the future needed skills and technologies that will make them fit from university level. It’s also very important that we do that by making them practice that themselves, this creates the needed awareness about what green jobs can be, and how they can be qualified, accordingly their interest changes and so do their plans to pursue green sectors.

2-Future Thinking and creativity is a must to be included in education since it enhanced the creativity in school students and will help them in becoming future inventors and in having a say in creating their desired futures. It's a successful tool to be used for achieving behavioral change, especially starting from age 13, where before future thinking, they were very focused on themselves with limited awareness or care about the surroundings or the resources, which completely changed after future thinking, so it's a key for fighting cultural barrier against green behavior adoption. Gaming, Integrating Technology, Drawing &amp; Story telling are very important tools to be integrated at this age for creating future immersing and facilitating scenario building &amp; thus behavioral change later. 

3-Agrotourism include more opportunities than expected, especially for businesses and startups and also for women. Agritourism is a whole value chain; and can include a lot of market players and industries. Agritourism can increase GDP, connect policies and ministries on aligned agenda, it's a strong way for women empowerment. Rural communities perceived agritourism as their gateway to their arts, culture &amp; products, and as the solution for changing farmer’s image &amp; ending bullying. 

4- Future Thinking is a powerful tool to create awareness even with rural communities, especially the Concept of “Reframing” that was really useful in building imaginations since it killed “Used-To” frames; like New Foods/climate smart crops and agritourism possibility that they didn’t even imagine to be possible before, where things started with “No New Foods, Rejection to New Crops” in the early games, ending by imagining new foods and animals and expecting disappearance of some in the developed scenarios. Integrating facilitating games, videos and storytelling is a must with rural communities too, for creating future immersing and facilitating scenario building &amp; thus awareness and behavioral change later.

5-There's nothing currently focused to supporting "Women in Energy" neither financial product, not focused entrepreneurship support (especially tech wise), which came out as key for promoting them. Same goes for agritourism &amp; climate smart crops, that need system transformation, being new topics, especially "Women-Tailored" in their domains. In general, financial products need a lot of innovation, with less bureaucratic inquiries, women-tailoring, better rates, climate insurance scheme, and financial capacity building.

Elders of rural communities, especially of agricultural background, sometimes dominated the discussions.

The nurture of rural community and school students in spending short time in their daily work/school made their energy by the end of each workshop down and not focused. 

Key challenge that guided the rural elderly’s imagination in possible scenarios was their religious belief that after each challenge, there’s prosperity. It also guided their imagination with respect to technology, where for them 2050 is the end, &amp; thus we’ll be back to past life &amp; technology will stop. They perceived food technologies, like meat substitutes, insects' proteins, new genetic strains of fruits &amp; vegetables as unacceptable.

Delta is very diversified, &amp; because future thinking needs diversification, there was in a challenge in choosing a location that’s central for all, which affected controlling time &amp; managing people to some extent.

Conducting "Reframing Scenario of Climate Smart Crops" was really challenging in all future thinking groups, whether urban or rural, because of rejecting the hypothesis of having new foods

Building future scenarios for "Women in Energy" was challenging as well for the stakeholders, being an innovative topic.

University students had a challenge of different time zone and lack of participation of foreign shy students when it comes to output, they co-design together.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

What’re the signals of change, drivers &amp; events that are of most importance on the future of women in energy as well as women in agriculture? •  What’re the possible future scenarios? a.  How can we deal with all undesired scenarios? b.  What do we need to do to reach desired ones? ●What would a successful future for them look like? What’d be the future impact/scenario of agritourism on the future of small farmer (Man &amp; Woman)? d.  What’d be the future impact/scenario of Climate Smart crops on the future of small farmer (Man &amp; Woman)? 

Assess the current perception &amp; knowledge of school females about resources and Test if futures literacy will change their behavior &amp; make them interested to adopt green behavior

Assess the current perception &amp; knowledge of rural communities about agritourism &amp; climate smart crops and Test if futures literacy will change their perception &amp; make them interested in them.

Explore MicroFinancial demands, challenges as well as main sources/providers for farmers across Egypt, and segment that across size of famer, gender, age, location &amp; seasonality.

EXPLORE THE MOST URGENT GLOBAL CHALLENGES WITH A “FUTURE OF WORK LENS” (Health, Education, Climate Change, Humane Tech, Social Innovation, New Space Economy) LEARN WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME FUTURE FIT (Technologist, Innovator, Futurist, &amp; System Changer) Explore the emerging green jobs Assess the current perception &amp; knowledge of university females about green careers Test if this will change their behavior &amp; make them interested to pursue green careers.

## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

"Refuturism" Social Initiative

Integrating the needed tools from gaming, drawing, pictures, videos, storytelling as well as co-running future thinking workshops with Delta communities &amp; school level female students

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

British University in Egypt

Recruiting the target female students from the requested undergraduate specializations

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

"Future of Work Lab" Startup

Running the Future Fit Accelerator program and making sure that objectives are reached

Designing Students’ Call/Invitation

Co-Issuing Certificate of Internship/participation

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Agricultural Research Center. They were responsible for Scheduling the planned future thinking surveys &amp; workshops for "Women in agriculture" with Delta Agricultural stakeholders; in terms of recruiting the target participants as well as providing the location.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

“Refuturism”, social initiative (They don't have legal papers as a civil organization) that aims at spreading environmental education at schools using creative stories, videos, drawing &amp; future thinking. Their tools were useful in creating future immersing for school females and for rural communities, without which future thinking and scenario building would have been really difficult.

Future of Work Lab" startup. Their program "Future Fit Accelerator" was really unique, and worth being adopted by all universities, for creating awareness and making students future fit (In terms of skills, ways of working &amp; technologies), as well directing their interest for pursuing green sectors, especially females.

Agricultural Research Center is new for UNDP Egypt because it doesn't have strong portfolio in agriculture in terms of partners, and they are really well-connected with rural communities and governments, so recommended for fieldwork and growth later on for those insights with governments.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

British University in Egypt

Recruiting the target female students from the requested undergraduate specializations
