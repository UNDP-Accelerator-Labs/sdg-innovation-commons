## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Piloting local Data Observatory in Malaysia - International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO)
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



What makes a tourism destination, sustainable? Our challenge is, in the world where greenwashing is rampant, governments or public agencies are trying assert some destinations as eco-tourism or sustainable tourism. These practices are not evidence-based nor data-driven. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



INSTO provides framework for destinations to develop and manage their sustainability aspects using data and evidence.  For Malaysia, this is revolutionary as data ecosystem is mired with data unavailability or lack of evidence-based decision-making culture.  As such, no destination can claim they are sustainable, and continue to be unappealing the masses, with tourists keep concentrating on urban areas. 

The assessment of current local data ecosystems and pathways for data on sustainability performances and tourism statistics to be used for concrete actions or evidence-based strategies, is imperative.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Malaysia is trying to implement tourism industry recovery strategy to achieve an effective recovery plan,balancing economic interests and public health post-pandemic, throughout National Tourism Policy (NTP) 2020-2030. Tourism industry directly employs over 660,000 people in Malaysia, representing about 9% of the nation’s workforce, but little is known about how tourism can elevate sustainability practices and governance at local level.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Tourists arrival and revenue as a marker of tourism level are not enough to maintain competitiveness. There are more interest in sustainable tourism in Thailand and Indonesia compared to Malaysia

</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



AccLab brings in experience in change management and data innovation to support the introduction of SDG indicators in local councils, and design thinking approach that is suitable to pilot data observatory project like this. Together with  Sustainable Tourism project team, the pilot serves as learning platform to understand how to marry data to policy and data innovation, surfacing local solutions that will be applicable for the rest of aspiring sustainable tourism destinations in Malaysia

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
