Building Back Greener: Circular Economy, Food Waste, and Innovation Ecosystems
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that, in South Africa, approximately 30% of all food produced is lost or wasted and ends up in landfills whilst almost a quarter of the population are food insecure. Preventing wastage will not only positively effect food security, but also have broader economic, social, and environmental benefits.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In South Africa, 10 million tons of food go to waste every year. This accounts for a third of the 31 tons that are produced annually in the country. The impact of food waste cannot be underestimated as it has a triple negative impact. It is a waste of resources, including water and energy, used in the supply chain during production, distribution and handling; it creates a socioeconomic impact of food insecurity; and it has a negative environmental impact from the emission of GHG generated again on the supply chain from production through harvesting, processing, distribution and disposal of food that is not consumed.

 

A ballpark figure for the cost of embedded energy wasted because of food waste is R1 billion – an approximate estimate of combined diesel and electricity cost. The energy wasted every year in South Africa for producing food that is never consumed is estimated as sufficient to power the City of Johannesburg for roughly 16 weeks. The wasted embedded water would fill over 600 000 Olympic swimming pools. Given that farming consumes 62% of total freshwater used in SA, this is a huge waste of scarce water resources in the 30th driest country on the planet. About 90% of waste in SA is disposed of to landfills, where the food-waste component leads to the production of methane gas and carbon dioxide. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, having 28–36 times more impact on the environment than carbon dioxide.

 

This level of food loss and waste is unsustainable. It impacts on the competitiveness of the South African food industry by reducing the growth and employment potential of the sector. It is also a waste of valuable resources which, as the impact of climate change becomes more significant, could reduce the capability of the South African food industry to adapt. Finally, successfully reducing food loss and waste is an opportunity to mitigate the severe localised food insecurity that is being experienced by significant portions of the South African population.

> 

The economic impacts of the pandemic have and will continue to negatively impact food value chains with, for example, increasing fuel, oil, electricity, and water costs. The cost of food is estimated to rise a further 10% over 2021, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable.

 

The contraction of the economy directly impacts food security and nutrition. Data collected in communities indicate contracted spending on fruit and vegetables, with limited household funds being used primarily for staples such as maize (which is often poorly fortified).

 

Economic recovery plans have a strong focus on economic growth, driven in part by the country’s comparative advantage in coal and mining. Many groups are voicing concerns regarding the environmental impacts of these economic pathways, and the lack of focus on building back greener.

 

There are growing calls from civil society and other sectors to address the food system, with signals across thematic areas such as: redistribution of food from retailers which is past its sell by date but is still consumable; increasing household food production and localising food systems; shifting to sustainable food sources (for example macro algae) and plant-based diets.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The AccLab will be using our unique methodologies to design and implement this project cycle. We will be running an innovation challenge targeting the national innovation ecosystem to surface solutions related to food waste; we will be producing systems maps of food waste in selected local districts; we will be drawing on local innovation ecosystems to surface grassroots solutions related to food waste; we have partnered with a tourism precinct allowing us access to 80 food retailers to experiment and validate the solutions that are surfaced through the cycle. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The SA AccLab is contributing to building back greener and decreasing vulnerability by surfacing and validating food waste solutions in local and national innovation ecosystems. Addressing food waste can increase food security, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to the development of the circular economy.

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Hackathon - A Food Waste Innovation Challenge to surface and identify solutions in the national innovation ecosystem.

Solutions Mapping - understanding the contextual implications that have given rise to the solution and that inform scaling.

Co-creation - an intensive programme to develop entrepreneurs’ businesses as well as the innovations, and co-create food waste frameworks with local municipalities  

Systems thinking - developing systems maps discover key factors in food waste across the food value chain

Proof of concept - validation of selected innovations with companies as well as municipalities 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There are major research and knowledge gaps on national and local food loss and waste, therefore information is primarily obtained from best estimations and merely provides indications. Research is specifically lacking on the causes and nature of food waste along the various steps in the food supply chain and also, particularly, on accurate quantification. In South Africa there is a dearth of accurate and up-to-date information, such as related emissions research. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are collaborating with both national and local government where we will be implementing and scaling solutions in district municipalities. Our partners have additionally committed to securing investment for selected entrepreneurs. Depending on the results of the food waste maps, we will engage key stakeholders along the food value chain where we can create the most impact. As the project expands, we anticipate the development of collaborations with food retailers, commercial farmers, and large restaurant chains.
