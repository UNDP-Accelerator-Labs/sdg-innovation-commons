This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge "Innovating together for children and sustainable development", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management.
It consists of collecting solid waste for recycling and creating urban gardens that allow families to take advantage of the resources they have around them and the creation of a collection center to collect recyclable waste and sell it to a recycler to generate income for families so that they can obtain the harvest of their production and not despair that this can contribute to improving their family, personal and community economy.
