This program is aimed at people who own land smaller than 15 hectares, paying them to plant trees or manage natural forests. In order to enter the program, people must have a forest management plan and the ability to maintain the forest, either for productive purposes or only for reforestation.  


This scheme allows people to have even 5 hectares of land, making it an excellent model for the conservation of micro-ecosystems.
