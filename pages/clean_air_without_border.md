## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Clean Air Without Border, multisectoral innovation challenge for clean air in Thailand and Lao PDR
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that air pollution is an alarming issue affecting countries in Southeast Asia in recent years, and it is a transboundary issue that cannot be tackled by any country alone.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In recent years, in the face of population growth, economic expansion and attendant growth in demands for energy, agricultural production, tourism, transportation and general consumption, air pollution has become a leading threat to the health of the population and the environment alike.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

No one is unaffected by dirty air. Both outdoor air pollution and low physical activity-lifestyle are important environmental risk factors of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes. In the Asia Pacific Region, NCDs are now the most significant cause of death and disease and as a result impose a substantial social burden and economic costs (Low et al, 2015). According to the State of Global Air Report for 2019, elevated PM 2.5 levels have caused 23, 800 deaths in Thailand in 2017).  Particularly in the winter of 2019, many Thai cities including Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and surrounding provinces suffered under a haze of smog and ultra-fine dust. As late as March 2020, Chiang Mai was reporting mid-morning PM 2.5 levels in the range of 170.1 μg/m³, which is firmly in the unhealthy range. The Government of Thailand determined key contributors to poor air quality to include agricultural burning and forest fires in rural areas, vehicular emissions and constructions in the cities, and industrial discharges in concentrated industrial zones (Pollution Control Department, 2019). Lao PDR, a landlocked country, with the population of 7 million people has experienced poor air quality in many parts of the country. In 2021, the Air Quality Information from one sensor located in the heart of Vientiane Capital showed that there were 165 days considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, 100 days were unhealthy for everyone, and 10 days were in the very unhealthy range. Although there are no clear evidence or studies on deaths caused by air pollution in Lao PDR, it was reported that there were 114 pollution deaths per 100,000 population according to 2019 Global, Regional and Country Analysis on Pollution and Health Metrics.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

In Thailand, we have been growing interest of the public and citizen-led solutions. However, given the transboundary nature of air pollution, actions in any single country cannot effectively tackle the problem. This
transboundary and cross-sectoral challenge requires collective efforts and co-creation of solutions.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Accelerator Lab Thailand and Lao PDR jointly organize Clean Air Without Border innovation challenge to bring multisectoral stakeholders in the two countries to co-create innovative solutions together. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
