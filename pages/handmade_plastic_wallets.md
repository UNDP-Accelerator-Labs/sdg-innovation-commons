Innovator: Dalida J Borlasa

Narrative: Despite the banning of single-use plastic in Vanuatu, there are other plastic materials that get thrown around Port Vila town and these include used packets of milk tea and coffee. Another initiative that Dalida Borlasa from Malekula Island, Vanuatu, came up with, are these wallets that are woven from used packets of milk tea and coffee. It is recyclable, handy, easy to wash, and the locals can afford the wallet.
