A team from The National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy led by Borys Vasylkivskyi had the idea of reducing the amount of pollutants in the air, by using the same structures seen in the leaves and trunks of trees on the facades of houses. The tree leaf- and bark-inspired facade tile traps a significant proportion of airborne dust on its surface. The tiles, being rough and having grooves, are then washed clean by rainwater. The tiles can be arranged so that the rainwater flows through grooves to water tanks located at the bottom of the building wall (in the same way tree bark channels rainwater to the base of the tree, and its roots).
