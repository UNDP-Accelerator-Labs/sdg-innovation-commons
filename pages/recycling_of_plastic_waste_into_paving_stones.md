The CoGeNeT cooperative transforms plastic waste into paving stones. The objective of these young people is to promote sanitation in the neighbourhoods through the manufacture of ecological paving stones. The process consists of putting the plastic waste in a tank placed on the fire. When plastics are melted, sand is added and the whole thing is stirred. The paste obtained is placed in a mould and after a few minutes a 5 to 10cm thick paving stone is obtained.
