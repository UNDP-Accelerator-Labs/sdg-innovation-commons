UNDP Asia Pacific’s Women’s Mentoring Programme, was a profound personal, and professional experience. Participants discovered how to lead and recognize their potential. Tailored mentorship, paired with honest conversations helped participants navigate challenges and make informed decisions. Together, these tools provided invaluable insights and empowered participants to refine their leadership approaches, guiding them toward more strategic, confident decision-making. Here Aisha, Ananya, and Vipapone share insights to highlight how the programme has shaped them into confident and strategic leaders. Building Confidence While confidence is often seen as an inherent trait, for many women in the programme, it was something we had to develop. In a supportive environment, we confronted insecurities and built self-assurance. One participant shared how her initial self-doubt gradually shifted as she became more assertive and develop a firm communication style, both professionally and personally. What began as a leadership development journey evolved into a process of self-discovery, where many of us came to recognize our value, build resilience, and find our voice. The programme didn’t just enhance our leadership skills; it empowered us to challenge the limitations we once placed on ourselves. For many, it was the first step toward leading with confidence. Mentorship and Strategic Thinking A key strength of the programme was the pairing of each participant with a senior leader, who along with their guidance also provided strategic insights into navigating the intricacies of UNDP. Mentors that are at the level of Resident Representative (RR), Deputy RR or higher, shared practical advice on understanding internal structures, making informed decisions, and thinking beyond day-to-day tasks. This tailored mentorship helped us to refine our leadership approaches, fostering a long-term, strategic mindset. Networking One of the most valuable aspects of the programme was the peer group structure, which fostered candid discussions, feedback, and the exchange of ideas. More than just a support system, this network became a powerful tool for professional growth. One participant noted that, for the first time, she felt part of a larger ecosystem of women leaders facing similar challenges across the region. These connections transcended national boundaries and individual offices, creating a strong, cross-regional network of women committed to advancing leadership. Growth Through Small Steps Participants learned that significant change comes from small, consistent efforts. Aisha, for example, emphasized how simple practices—such as journaling and seeking feedback—led to meaningful progress in her leadership style. The mentorship programme underscored the importance of patience, reflection, and intentionality, and that small steps can lead to profound transformation. Importance of Diverse Leadership Perspectives Participants from the Asia-Pacific region expressed a strong desire to learn from women who had successfully navigated similar socio-cultural challenges. This highlights the need for more inclusive leadership development, where gender diversity is accompanied by greater representation of voices from different regions and backgrounds, and reflects the communities it serves and is responsive to their unique challenges. Engaging Men for Systemic Change Despite big strides, gender parity challenges persist. In regions where patriarchal norms dominate, women’s voices are often marginalized, particularly in decision-making processes. Even now, some female staff speak of untoward disruptions by male staff when facilitating sessions, and report that women’s voices often take a back seat in workshops on inclusion. To achieve lasting change, efforts must be made to address systemic barriers, and men must be engaged as active partners in the pursuit of gender parity. This requires creating leadership structures that encourage collaboration and promote equal representation. ConclusionWhile the Women’s Mentoring programme has successfully strengthened leadership skills and built networks, the journey toward true gender equality is ongoing. While it has fostered personal growth and self-awareness, to achieve sustainable change, we must continue to engage male allies and push for structural reforms that support inclusive leadership. By opening doors for individual advancement, the programme is helping to drive the broader mission of gender equality, leaving participants well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to development work across and beyond the region. --This blog was co-authored by Aisha Marzuki (Strategic Learning and Visual Designer, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub), Ananya Filbert (Human Resources Associate, UNDP India) and Vipapone (Tutu) Aphayvanh (Head of Programme Support Unit, UNDP Lao PDR) as well as edited by Cedric Monteiro (Regional Communications Specialist, UNDP Regional Hub)
