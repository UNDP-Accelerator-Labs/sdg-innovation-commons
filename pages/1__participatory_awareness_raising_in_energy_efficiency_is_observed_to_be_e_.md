## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Based on the action plan, AccLab Türkiye launched an experiment titled "Implementation of Participatory Handheld Thermal Camera Audits and Energy Efficiency (EE) Surveys In Households" on 1-Dec-2022 to be completed by 31-May-2023.  1) Participatory energy efficiency awareness raising through handheld thermal camera audits is observed to be effective in households 2) There is demand from especially white collar working class for energy efficiency and heat audits at homes to detect heat leaks and identify recommended actions and there could be substantial demand from other provinces if the experiment is replicated and upscaled nationally 3) Tenants (non-homeowners) tend to be more reluctant or hesitant in investing in energy efficiency in their rented houses/flats and thus may not have applied for audits 4) A portion of audit participants abstain from disclosing their income levels probably due to reasons external to the experiment such as fear of taxation, financial audits etc. 5) Heat audits can also be considered for summer time cooling audits at homes

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Tenants (non-homeowners) tend to be more reluctant or hesitant in investing in energy efficiency in their rented houses/flats and thus may not have applied for audits at households. On the other hand, the outreach might have been limited with UNDP communication channels.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is no systemic data collection on the types of household heat loss and leaks. Also, the data on the root causes on and the level of willingness/unwillingness of household residents to act for energy efficiency at residential level is missing. So participatory heat audits with handheld thermal cameras are cost effective and indicative of heat loss types, and when coupled with household surveys can tell much about the socio-economic standing and willingness level of households for energy efficiency investments.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Participation of citizens in the scientific visualisation of the heat loss at their homes increases their awareness and foster their willingness to act for it. Visualized data gives the auditor a better opportunity to detect leaks and identify the actions to be taken in a more informed and precise manner.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

An academician (Derya Aydemir) was invited to participate and lecture the Ministry staff on the use of thermal cameras for heat audits to enhance their capacity and ensure standardized approach to household surveys.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Department of Energy Efficiency and Environment (DEEE) is the partner in experiment and their role is to collect applications, carry out household heat audits and surveys and report to AccLab for data analysis. DEEE is also the main body responsible for energy efficiency policy and MRV in the country.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

DEEE is a new partner that UNDP has not worked with for a long time. Urban household residents are a totally new target group.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

To be answered after the completion of the experiment.
