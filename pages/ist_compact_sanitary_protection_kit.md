While everyone held their heads on the issue of covid, Guinea, through its team of engineers from the IST institute in Mamou, set to work hard and ended up designing a device for KRAPOS name which means: Automatic Sanitary Protection Kit, whose role is to Test and Prevent covid-19 disease, by aggregating the following functionalities: Scanner for the temperature level, hand washing with a reservoir integrated soap and drinking water, hand drying after washing and finally, a water level indicator to deal with any possible shortage.

On the strength of their results, the team of researchers finally presented their solution to OAPI at the African technological innovation fair where it was awarded the UEMOA prize et lui en a même dressé un Brévet. Our team of engineers has already started marketing this device and has prioritized other university education institutions.
