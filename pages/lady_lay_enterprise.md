> Brief description of the innovation

Lady-lay is an egg producing enterprise which aims to curb food insecurity and unemployment by providing quality eggs. Our slogan “it’s just not any egg” shows how quality will be the standard for the business.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The current market of consumption eggs is between k50 and k60 with 1.1 billion eggs laid by 3,600,000 layers. It is estimated that commercial egg production will grow in the coming years with 30- 40%. This will be mainly driven by the increased number of new entrants in the sector, the increased production of day old chicks (new hatching capacity is installed) and the increase of export to neighboring countries (DRC and other COMESA countries). The Egg production industry in the last 50 years has shown dramatic changes in both domestics and international environments. In 1969, Zambia produced 11,470 tonnes, in 2018 egg production was 52,597 tonnes growing at an average annual rate of 3.51%.  The demand for eggs in Zambia and the surrounding region is quite high and does not meet supply. The significant difference between supply and demand is due to high production costs. Lady-lay will help bridge this gap between supply and demand. Individuals are a small sector in the market segmentation. They are a large group but they buy a relatively small amount of eggs.The part of the market that we hope to supply a large number of eggs to are the industries that need eggs. We have strategically placed our site close to these industries. They are bakeries, restaurants, boarding schools, home delivery food centers, retail shops, and supermarkets.

> Technical Feasibility

Competition is high in the poultry sector with big companies like Zambeef, hybrid poultry farms and golden lay that contribute largely. They are also many small-scale farmers that are into egg production. However, competition with smaller companies is not so keen on the markets though it still exists. The reason being that poultry products are not branded products; hence, what usually matters is effective positioning and timing. Our differential and comparative advantage over our competitors is that we will be producing high quality eggs and always selling them at a ngwee or kwacha less than our competitors to generate even greater sales and profit margins. We are entering the industry to provide quality affordable chicken products. We saw that some of our competitors are seasonal they only produce their chicken at a given period. Our goal includes growth and operating all year round. We know the importance of time and know that people have many and varying activities; knowing all that we will be delivering our products to the customer’s door. Another factor that will help us achieve our goals is ensuring our employees motivated and happy and helping, this will help our employees focus on their work and provide better services to our customers. We expect our business to grow and begin operating at the national level and this will be achieved through management’s hard work, efficiency and effective use of materials.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our Vision includes employment generation, wealth creation, and producing high quality eggs with a purpose to contribute to Zambia’s economic growth, building business relations, curbing food insecurity and meeting the customers’ demands.Our values include developing our communities and Nation at large, commitment to our customers by providing the best high quality eggs, working as a team, and upholding integrity. The objective is to provide quality eggs, reduce unemployment, curb food insecurity, grow Zambia’s economy and alleviate poverty.
