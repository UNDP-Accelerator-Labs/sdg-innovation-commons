> Description of the solution

This system can record detailed information of each chicken, such as breed, date of birth, vaccination history, etc.
The climate monitoring system automatically collects environmental data like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric gas content in the chicken coop. It also has Diet Management which can automatically generate a scientific feeding plan and supply appropriate feed regularly and quantitatively according to the chicken breed and growth stage.
The disease monitoring system monitors the health status of chickens in real-time and can issue a risk warning in a timely manner when abnormalities are detected, reminding managers to take measures.
