Increased access for young graduates in the job market
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in Cameroon mismatches between the skills received upon graduation and the needs of the labor market limit the access of young graduates to formal jobs. As an illustration, despite about 100,000 graduates entering the job market every year, only 5% are able to get a decent job. Thus, the bulk of them has to move to informal occupations, with significant impact on young people unemployment and underemployment rates (respectively 9% and 75.8%). We have continued to work on this challenge for a year now, gaining useful insights as we interact more with other Country office programmes having similar objectives. We are trying to explore emerging trends amongst youth faced with unemployment challenges, which for us will be determinant guidance factor on what we should focus on after this next three months. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Our challenge dates to last year as the Accelerator Lab Team was involved in a selection process organized by the Country Office in the realm of the post-Covid-19 response. We conducted focus discussion groups with young people and a survey that highlighted the hardships they face when looking for a job after their graduation. Many said that they abandoned their search. Some, despite having masters and PhDs turned to the informal sector and became either small farmers or moto taxi drivers. For them, entering the job market is more than mission impossible, given many constraints. Many said that employers ask for experience when limited opportunities for internships exist. They also mentioned that syllabus taught in most educational institutions do not match job specifications. Most of them also hinted that one can hardly find a job without knowing an insider within public or private enterprises. These insights from a group of your Cameroonian are shared by most of the youth in the country, a situation that is fueled by social, institutional, and demographic drivers. As far as demography is concerned, Cameroon is experiencing strong population growth with an average annual rate of 2.6%, made up mainly of young people who face a poor access to decent employment opportunities. Just like most other African countries, more than half of the population in Cameroon is less than 20 years of age. Young people are primarily young girls (52% of youth) and live in the country. It is evident from the background that gender, age, and geographical location of young people characterize potential risk factors hindering the realization of their full potential, and advancement. Then, among the main causes of this high rate of unemployment and underemployment is first and foremost the mismatch between the education and training system and the needs of the labor market. This mismatch, which amplifies youth unemployment, is due to several factors. On the demand side, very few internships are posted by public or private bodies, hence limited opportunities for young people to build experience early in their career. Besides, except for large companies, few companies have tools for forecasting jobs and skills that allow them to better express their future recruitment needs. At the macro level, there is little national capacity to develop training strategies that anticipate future skill needs and no genuine public-private partnership for the supervision of vocational training for young people. In response to this problem, the Government, and its partners (private sector, Development partners, civil society etc) have developed programs and projects to promote youth employment. However, these have not really succeeded in addressing these issues in a sustainable manner. Finally, social and psychological factors explain the poor access of young people to descent jobs. The current situation is one of self-doubt, fear of criticism and age stereotypes which consist other factors that greatly hinder exploitation of the full potential of youths at different levels in the Country. As a result, socio-economic and political instability, increased juvenile delinquency are some of the undesirable effects provoked by the current status quo. Cameroon is facing a series of challenging issues. First, the doubling of the population by 2050 is a major challenge and represents a source of potential social tension, especially as natural resources are becoming scarce. The limited absorption capacity by the Government and even the private sector represents a significant break to the materialization of a job rich growth. Socio-political crises in the North and South West regions, East and Far North regions are often related to the difficulties faced by young people in search of a decent living. Finally, and more recently, COVID-19 had a huge negative impact on the Cameroonian economy. The pandemic costed the economy jobs, led many corporations to go bankrupt, and to dismiss their employees in a context characterized by limited social safety nets. Given those stakes, working on this challenge would be important for the Lab to support all stakeholders involved in promoting youth inclusion in the job market in five major Cameroonian cities while striving for efficiency through more innovative methods and techniques which ensure youths are endowed with the right skills necessary for them to compete in the job market. Right skills for us right now go beyond looking at education curricula, or scanning systems for availability of employment opportunities. Reality and context wise after one year working on this challenge requires much more focus on what young people are interested in. We need to examine detailly why attention has been driven away from one domain to another, and the opportunities available in their interest areas. Only then can we provide adequate and result oriented support as we collaborate and seek partners for scale up. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">

The Country Office has embarked in a Pan African initiative supported by UNDP, the Youth Connekt that aims at connecting youth to socio-economic opportunities for their empowerment and full participation in development. Contacts and discussions in the realm of that program led the Accelerator Lab to gain access to several key reports on the professional and entrepreneurial constraints that Young Cameroonian face. Beyond data from the National Institute of Statistics and ILO, the PANEJ Report, for example, provides an excellent overview of those constraints in Cameroon. The situation was exacerbated given the Covid-19 crisis as highlighted by the publication of several key studies such as “Rapport d’enquête socioéconomique sur les impacts du Covid-19”; “Impact des mesures gouvernentales de lute contre la COVID-19 sur les libertés publiques au Cameroun” ADISI 2021; « l’impact de la pandémie actuelle (Covid-19) sur les entrepreneurs, les travailleurs et les étudiants », CEREM 2021

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

One of the strongest weak signals embodying the urgency of this frontier challenge is the number of people applying to programs launched by the Country office to mitigate the impact of COVID on young people and women . As an illustration, last year, the Country Office received more than 8 500 applications, often from highly educated people, for a program aimed at supporting agri-entrepreneurs in only 8 days. A programme that only needed to provide support to 500 young men and women. This is a common trend for several other programmes that have been launched up till now. Sometimes, despite the influx of applications, a majority end up not being qualified due to nature and quality of skills expressed. Most recently a youth connekt  programme to support 100 young entrepreneurs in the waste recycling and renewable energy sector , ended up identifying just 48applicants out of 122 application files received. Evidence of a low skilled youthful population, rich in theory, but poor in practice and experience. Same experience goes for public/government launched competitions into specific fields where large number of youths apply when usually not up to 50persons and even less are usually considered.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Several organizations have been working on the same issue in our environment but the added value of the AccLab is methodology: Experimental results; New approaches; Best results than usual. The lab in Cameroon positions itself as an innovation advisory service not just to UNDP, but to the government and other stakeholder institutions, reshaping their thoughts on how to view and invest in development. The lab would leverage on UNDP’s special position in the ecosystem to promote experiments and innovation around youth employability amongst key stakeholders and other development actors. The lab through sensing, exploring, and testing hypothesis, would position itself as a focal point for connecting young people to relevant corporations that suit their skills and expertise and link them to diverse opportunities that build the necessary skills required by corporations. Moreover, it is a key issue in the national development strategy; Top priority for UNDP Country Office and more relevant in these times of COVID 19 pandemic that has impacted youth and women employment.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

National statistics reveal that 100,000 graduates enter the job market every year in Cameroon but only 5% get a decent job. Together with the Accelerator labs,  we can work for a Cameroon  where the skills and talents of youth will be unstoppable!

Partnership with GIZ  Skills Initiative for Africa is new to UNDP because unlike before where collaboration between GIZ and UNDP focused on governance and decentralization aspects (Units). Partnership has taken a different dimension with the Accelerator Lab, through working with related government, private sector and CSO partners to identify best ways of matching skills to existing opportunities. Job fairs, workshops, working groups with systems and design thing approaches, key informant interviews to better understand the gap in skills have been essential areas for collaboration with the GIZ SIFA working group.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Skills development or Adapting school curricular to needs of the job market, which is most relevant to facilitating access to decent jobs for Cameroonian youth? 


In order to address this challenge, we aim at discovering how to design a successful work/study or block period training program in main  cities. We also intend to build a successful portfolio of innovations capable of helping young people to find and take advantage of entrepreneurial and professional opportunities. We need to understand the complexities of the job market, various graduate study programs, and the various linkages that determine the access of young people to the job market.  We are trying to positively change the dynamics of the job market for young people and more specifically to improve that needed by employers. Notably, we aim at finding solutions capable of smoothing and reducing job market frictions for young people. As a result, we hope to be able to mobilize solutions able to impact cohorts of young graduates in those five Cameroonian cities.
