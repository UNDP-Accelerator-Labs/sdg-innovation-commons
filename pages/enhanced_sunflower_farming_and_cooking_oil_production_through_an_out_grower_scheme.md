> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation seeks to introduce an enhanced sunflower farming through small scale farmers’ out-grower scheme. Additionally, the project seek out to begin adding value to the harvested sunflower by processing it into cooking oil which will finally be sold on both retail and wholesale.
To accomplish all such, 200Kg local sunflower seed shall be bought, fifty lead-farmers will be recruited, trained, be provided with local sunflower seed and later lease with them on the sale of their produce to my company. Before harvest of the crop, the company will construct a processing plant, buy an Oil Expeller Machine and conduct installation in readiness for production of cooking oil. Once the commodity is produced, it will be sold to both local and international communities.
Once funded and implemented, the project shall create employment, better the living standards, expand exports, develop the economy through foreign exchange for the nation, local and international communities and markets.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Considering that sunflower is an easy to manage crop, requires no fertilizer, no pesticides and that seed will be given for free and with ready market for their produce, farmers will then generate income through savings of money realized from non-labour intensive, non-use of fertilizer and pesticides which they will even use to grow other cash crops to make more money. Moreover, our cooking oil customers will gain more money through minimized transport and logistic costs and by buying the commodity at a cheaper price locally. For the company, overwhelming earnings will be realized through some anticipated enormous customers as it will be the first of its kind in the province.
On the other hand, the business will target local and international markets of Luapula province and the Republic of Congo consisting of retailers, wholesalers, households, restaurants and hotels.
Finally, Sunflower crop is often labelled as environmental-friendly for many objective reasons: limited amounts of N fertiliser, no irrigation, limited use of pesticides which makes it a low emitter of greenhouse gases (either directly or not) as compared to cereals and oilseed rape. In addition, sunflower has a potential for providing multiple ecosystem services in diverse cropping systems (e.g. pollinators feeding).

> Technical Feasibility

The project design depicts a cycle of community members being given sunflower seed for free, grows it and sells back to the company when processed sunflower is sold back to the community in form of cooking oil.
To be implemented in the following proposed way:
November 2021: Sourcing funds and recruitment of 50 lead-farmers
December 2021: Buying 400Kg local sunflower seed, training of 50 lead-farmers and distribution of seed
January 2022: Site selection and clearing
February-April 2022: Buying building materials and commencement of plant construction
May 2022: Commencement of buying sunflower
June 2022: Buying and installation of Oil Expeller Machine; Computer Metrology Dispencer and 5000 litres Tank
July 2022: Commencement of cooking oil production

> Anticipated Social Impact

Therefore, sunflower production plays an important role in the tight balance of food-fuel security as well as the environment. Thus, sunflower cultivation can be seen as an opportunity to improve the society.
Currently, the market is faced with high cost in stocking cooking oil due to distance from the source (Tanzania). Since my company will be the first of its kind, therefore, this innovation will significantly reduce their transport and logistic costs, hence, making it relevant to the market.
Conclusively, to increase income generation and expand foreign exchange through exports, in future, I look forward to expand business by introducing Biodiesel production through fermentation of sunflower cooking oil that will be produced by the company. In biodiesel production, no feedstock is excluded because all its feedstocks are both fuel and food. Bioenergy investment can bring opportunities that will (i) drive rural development, and (ii) increase the harvest for both food and fuel crops.
