## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Transparency, Social Dialogue, and Citizen Participation.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Deepen and consolidate participatory institutions and practices through the use of civic technologies and human centered design methods.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Participatory institutions are incipient and underdeveloped in Paraguay. The country maintains high levels of administrative and fiscal centralization. Most participatory processes are symbolic or consultative in nature. Political and partisan polarization are barriers to effective planning in most public policy areas, as are limited data about citizen's needs and policy preferences.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

There is very basic quantitative administrative data collected and managed by the planning secretariat about local planning councils.

Over the last 15 years, Paraguay has experienced a series of political crises, marked by social mobilization, changes in government, and waning trust in government institutions and political actors. The COVID 19 pandemic has not been an exception. Most recently, the headquarters for Paraguay's largest political party was burned by protesters. On the other hand, in our experience, Paraguayan citizens respond positively and with tremendous gratitude to well structured opportunities to voice their opinions, share their experiences, and state their needs regarding public policy design and institutional action.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab brings methodological and theoretical expertise on the topics of participatory institutions and civic technologies, from a social science and social informatics perspective. Combined with a practical, problems-focused application of these methods and concepts, AccLabPy is able to accelerate the development of participatory governance in Paraguay, where it is almost entirely absent. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

AccLabPy's problems-focused application of civic technologies, aims to accelerate the development of participatory governance in Paraguay, where participatory institutions and practices remain the exception rather than the rule.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we develop methodologies, platforms, and hybrid technologies to facilitate meaningful citizens participation in public policy design and implementation?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We have been protoyping different participatory methods as opportunities arise in the country office and evaluating them informally. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data we are generating is mostly through a trial and error process. They provide an important demonstration effect for our partner institutions, many of which have very limited experience implementing and running participatory processes. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The methods we are developing have very broad applicability, especially for the National Innovation Strategy, the Planning Secretariat, any Ministry engaged in a planning process, as well as civil society and private organizations.
