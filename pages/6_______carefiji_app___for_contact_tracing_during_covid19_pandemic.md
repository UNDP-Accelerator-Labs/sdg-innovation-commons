A mobile app developed by the Fijian Government to assist the Ministry of Health with contract tracing efforts during the COVID19 pandemic. It does not require data as it uses Bluetooth to determine when users are within certain proximity of each other, and a QR code to check in to public spaces such as shops, restaurants and office buildings.
