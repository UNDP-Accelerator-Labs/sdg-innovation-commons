## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Uncovering new perspectives to mitigate gender-based violence.
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to uncover new perspectives that challenge existing narratives and provide fresh insights into the complex drivers of gender-based violence.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



UNDP Samoa GEN3 programme Spotlight Initiative has implemented and carried out tremendous work in building awareness, capacities and gender equal mechanisms at the community level to increase public ownership in collectively working together to mitigate and reduce gender-based violence incidences. However, while awareness has increased there are still challenges when it comes to assistance being afforded to survivors of gender-based violence, in particular frontline emergency responses.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



By critically evaluating protocols, resources, and training, we can transform frontline responses to gender-based violence into truly trauma-informed systems. A shift towards specialized policies, sufficient investment, and comprehensive training will equip responders with the skills and support to provide sensitive, effective assistance that promotes healing.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Transforming frontline responses to gender-based violence requires critically evaluating protocols, resources &amp; training. Specialized policies, more investment &amp; comprehensive responder training will build truly trauma-informed systems that promote healing.

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.



<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the partner:



1. Fire and Emergency Services Authority - Emergency helpline 911

Untapped data on calls received pertaining to gender-based violence. Sensemaking and exploration to ascertain how Samoa can transition to a caller assisted dispatch system.

2. Ministry of Police &amp; Prisons - Domestic Violence Unit

There are community outposts that can be explored for capacity building in being responsive and trauma informed to calls of gender-based violence. Sensemake and explore with the Domestic Violence Unit on potential experiment on how to mobilize community outposts.

3. Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



1. What innovative methods and metrics can we utilize to evaluate the real-world impact of current gender-based violence advocacy and awareness programs on reducing incidence rates and changing cultural attitudes?

2. What shifts in protocols, resources, and training are needed to transform frontline responses and build trauma-informed systems that comprehensively address gender-based violence?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The emergency response call center is an untapped data resource in terms of providing a visualization of the number of 911 calls that come through for GBV. This data is a good indicator of whether there has been a positive behavioural change in reporting cases of GBV. AccLab is intending to partner with both the FESA and the DVU of the Samoa Police to conduct a series of sensemaking workshops to uncover signals of change to guide the participatory design of a rapid ethnography to be conducted with select communities based on the geographic locations or clusters of GBV related calls. This rapid ethnography will also inform solutions to be mapped from these communities.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Data acquired from the 911 emergency response will add value by expanding and signaling whether interventions conducted by the UNDP in Samoa are effective in influencing real change amongst the population in reporting GBV. In addition, the nature of these calls can inform how Samoa's emergency responses with GBV related incidences can be improved and strengthened to be more trauma informed and based on the needs of the survivors of GBV.
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



FESA and the DVU of the Samoa Police Force would benefit from this work in terms of improving public service delivery, building in-country capacity and capabilities of the enforcement sector to be more trauma informed and survivor friendly and safe. In addition, there is potential for a digital marker to be incorporated as we sense and explore this challenge. A champion in Samoa for early collaboration to grow this challenge is the Samoa Victim Support Group and their community informants.
