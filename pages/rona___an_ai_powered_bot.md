The AI powered Bot that provides credible, accurate and verified information on COVID-19 was developed by 21-year-old Brian Ndegwa, a 2nd year student at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology. Rona has an analytics platform that gives visualized statistics per county. It also has a feature that allows users to perform a 5-minute self test and know their likelihood of having the virus based on the systems they have.
