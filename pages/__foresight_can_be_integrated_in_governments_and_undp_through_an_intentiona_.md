## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Foresight can be integrated in governments and UNDP through an intentional and thorough risks and opportunities exercise - Anticipatory governance as a framing is useful for governments and ministries instead of foresight - Foresight workshops can be tokenistic if not accompanied by other types of support in policy planning - Government ministries are keen on engaging in foresight as a planning and design process but also as a way of citizen consultations - The architecture needed to integrate foresight does not exist and needs to be created so that foresight can be of value add

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Anticipatory Governance was conceptually easy to grasp but operationally challenging to explain. There is a need to test this and use learnings to legitimize. However, there is a high risk for UNDP to lose credibility were the process to go wrong or not work. This tension means we need to take careful and small steps forward

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We needed to get a sense of how AG looked like in other countries, what were the needs of Pacific stakeholders (especially governments) and what spaces looked promising for integration. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Co-creation and design thinking was critical for joint ownership. Foresight and futures tools were applied to governance - Three horizons framework, visioning tools like Inclusive Imaginaries, particiatry futures was used for 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Piloted a participatory futures methodology with PIANGO – Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organizations. As part of UNDP’s ongoing support, UNDP facilitated two-part foresight exercise in the PIANGO group retreat in December – one on anticipatory futures to elicit thinking on the future of civil society with focus on consensus building, and other to translate the vision into ideas for PIANGO’s strategy development as well as joint actions with UNDP’s Public Finance Management project over next five years.

With the Ministry of Health in Fiji, a strategic foresight workshop was designed where we facilitated a scenario planning and visioning exercise with all stakeholders working on NCDs in Fiji to build collective vision, support the identification joint action areas, and inform governance structure and processes of the High-Level Steering Committee, which is still in formation. The aim was to improve existing planning and coordination processes.   As next steps, we will continue to support the consultation process with key collaborators and stakeholders and review the governance structure for Wellness/NCD which can be accommodative of multiple scenarios and emerging health trends.   In Vanuatu, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is the largest Ministry with many departments (and more departments added this year) each with their own programs and partners, so a cohesive approach is essential. There are gaps and opportunities with many potential partners emerging but duplication, poor focus, sharing of resources (human and financial) and inter-operational IT, and integrated databases is a challenge. With limited budget and increasing public expectations of service delivery – a more sector wide approach is needed to “future fit” the Ministry to ensure that as a Central Line Ministry it is “fit for purpose” – delivering and creating opportunities for delivery of decentralised services to the provinces where 74.5% of the citizens of Vanuatu reside. UNDP/VEEP is in Q1 2022 supporting the Ministry with a Sector Strategy Workshop with Government ministries, departments, provincial structures, donors, UN and NGO stakeholders to explore the opportunities for strong sector wide anticipatory planning, harmonization, identification of risks and opportunities. Alongside Ministry of Indigenous Affairs, 4 workshops were held in 3 villages in two settings: (a) Votua Village in the Ba Province of Ba, and (b) second bringing together Kava farmers from different parts of the Province of Kadavu. The workshops utilized imaginations as a data point for policy making in the local governance space. The methodology used was inclusive imaginaries, adapted to focus on anticipatory governance. This was part of Deep Listening Exercise of Social Innovation Methodology of ALC.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

NA

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Worked alongside the Effective Governance team. One member from the EG team led this effort with support from other team members. This was also done in partnership with SPP team in NY who provided oversight and advisory
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay allowed for designing a portfolio of experiments which were done simultaneously and this experimental approach allowed for iterative learning
