CIRCULAR ECONOMY ROADMAP IN DA NANG CITY

Introduction

In Vietnam in general and Da Nang City in particular, economic
activities have been adopting the traditional approach, which is called linear
economy. Goods are produced from raw materials, sold, used (consumed)
and then mostly disposed of as waste. At the same time, many consumer
products are not used to their full life cycle, and some are purchased for
a single use only. In that context, the concept of circular economy has
emerged and encouraged the gradual shift from the linear model to a
model of better use of resources, which is not only more sustainable but
also opens up new opportunities for transformation to inclusive growth
model.

Circular economy is currently becoming a common development
trend globally and has been chosen to become the focus of development
policies in many countries and cities around the world with the aim toward
sustainable development. In Vietnam, the Law on Environmental Protection
2020 specifically mentions the development of circular economy in
the Article 142, “Circular economy is an economic model in which design,
production, consumption and service activities aim at reducing the exploitation
of raw materials, prolonging the product life cycle, limiting the generation
of waste and minimizing adverse impacts on the environment”. Decree no.
08/2022/ND-CP dated January 10, 2022 of the Government detailing
a number of articles of the Law on Environmental Protection 2020 has
specified criteria, roadmap and mechanism to encourage the development
of circular economy. Decision no. 687/QD-TTg dated June 7, 2022 of the
Prime Minister approving the Project for development of circular economy
in Vietnam has also assigned the People's Committees of provinces and
cities to actively develop and implement the roadmap, tasks and solutions
to facilitate circular economy models and projects in the localities.

An assessment of current situation and analysis of opportunities and
challenges for the development of circular economy in Da Nang City shows
that there are many reasons why it is necessary to transform and apply the
circular economy model to Da Nang City: (1) put an end to the situation
where the volume of waste has been continuously increasing while there
is no effective treatment plan and the economic value of waste cannot be
exploited; (2) limit negative impacts on the environment caused by the
linear economic model; derive benefits in the context of resource scarcity
and climate change; (3) exploit the City's existing high-tech foundation;
(4) overcome and correct socio-economic problems such as rapidly
aging population, unstable economic growth affected by non-traditional
risks, unemployment, low-wage jobs, low skills, income inequality, gender
inequality; (5) achieve many targets and indicators required by the SDGs.

To develop circular economy for the City, it is necessary to assess
the current situation and specify goals and a roadmap that match the
criteria of a circular city. The gap between current situation and future
goals will create enormous innovation potential for the City. This proposal
is made based on updated content of the Summary Report of the Research
on building and developing circular economy in Da Nang City, on the basis
of adopting relevant documents associated with the Law on Environmental
Protection 2020, supplementing lessons learned from the policy experiment
on circular economy in Da Nang City, incorporating gender equity issue and
recognizing the importance of an informal waste collection system in the
transition to a circular economy model of Da Nang City.

The roadmap for development of circular economy in Da Nang
City will be associated with overall and specific visions, goals, tasks and
solutions to implement circular economy in Da Nang City within the 10-year
national action plan period, from now to 2030.

Development practice shows that a number of economic sectors/industries in Da Nang City have
paid attention to the design following the principles of circular economy before putting it into
practice.

Agriculture

Construction

For Da Nang City, the practice of agricultural development has signified
some manifestations of circular economy, such as in Hoa Vang District,
which has implemented the model of Garden - Pond - Barn and the variants
of Garden - Pond - Barn - Biogas, or Garden - Pond - Barn - Forest;

Currently, FPT Complex is one of the pilot projects applying green - energy
saving building standards, adopting 2013 version of QCVN09. It is currently
the only project in Da Nang City which has been granted the certificate
of Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE)5. In addition, the
buildings of Ecogreen Hotel, Nhu Minh Hotel and Cardiology Centre of Da
Nang City have complied with the National Technical Regulation QCVN
09:2013/BXD.

the construction of an eco-industrial park6. During the period 2015 - 2019,
Da Nang City cooperated with experts from Vietnam Cleaner Production
Centre to support RECP assessment7 for more than 29 businesses; experts
of the Project have proposed 334 cleaner production solutions; in which
228 solutions have been implemented, helping businesses save more
than VND 14 trillion per year, reducing more than 50,000 cubic meters of
wastewater, 7,000 tons of CO2 and 2,700 tons of solid waste per year.

Among different types of renewable energy, Da Nang City has great potential
in solar power. By the end of 2020, Da Nang City had 2,529 customers
installing rooftop solar power with the total installed capacity of 81.7 MWp.
There are no ground and water solar power projects.8

Moreover, in terms of energy audit report, 49 businesses which are key
energy facilities (not counting those which are not key energy facilities)
have compiled energy audit reports. The number of businesses/facilities
having energy managers certified by the Ministry of Industry and Trade is
45. To improve efficiency and save electricity in urban traffic lighting, Da
Nang City has also implemented two important projects: The Pilot Project
to replace the public lighting system with LED lights and the Project to build
a central control system and remote control system of electrical cabinets.

Many businesses in Da Nang City have applied the circular economy model
in their production and business activities, including: Businesses which
have invested in the production of non fired bricks; companies which
have solutions to save energy and achieve high efficiency; Minh Hong
Biotechnology Co., Ltd which is one of the typical businesses applying
circular economy in production, turning collected organic waste into
organic dish washing liquid, organic laundry detergent, floor cleaner, etc.,
businesses and start-up projects adopting circular economy such as the
models of Green Run Series, VietArt, Fuwa Refill Station, Green Building,
Green University DUE, etc.

Many agricultural production models applying high technology which
is environment-friendly at various scopes (households, cooperatives,

Development of
Sharing Economy
in Da Nang City

For accommodation and food services, the collection of leftover food for
resale to livestock production or for processing of organic fertilizer can
be considered as a circular economy approach. Many hotels encourage
guests to reuse towels, collect and recycle used soap bars, and plastic
items (toothbrushes, combs, etc.) are collected and resold to collection and
recycling facilities.

Da Nang City has launched the movement to limit the use of non-
biodegradable plastic bags at markets and supermarkets in the city. The
City has also promulgated and trained the implementation of 01 Code of
Conduct for tourism activities in Da Nang City written in many languages
(Vietnamese, English, Chinese, Korean, etc.) and 09 sets of professional
standards for tourism business activities 9; which provide instructions and
reminders to relevant parties about reducing the use of plastic bags and
single-use plastic products, and having solutions for reuse and recycling
plastic products to protect the environment.

The movement to say "no" to plastic bottles has been launched and received
positive responses from many agencies, businesses and other organizations
in Da Nang City. It has partly contributed to changing the long-standing
habits in offices of Da Nang City. So far, 100% of meetings and receptions
at Da Nang City Administrative Center use glass water bottles instead of
convenient plastic bottles.

Services based on the principles of sharing economy are a form of circular
consumption. The foundation for the emergence of sharing economy model
is the rapid development of Internet and the main element of this model is
the connection among consumers. In Da Nang City, the sharing economy
model is associated with businesses such as: Bee, Grab, Airbnb; followed by
the appearance of many Vietnamese start-ups such as: Ahamove, jupviec.
vn, Com me nau, etc.

Environment, in the city up to now, 37 models associated with green
consumption have been implemented such as waste battery collection
bins, green roofs, growing bananas for leaves, civilized garbage collection
points, environmentally self-governing residential areas; environment-
friendly teams; no garbage villages; no garbage schools, women limiting
the use of plastic bags, etc. In general, the trend of green consumption in Da
Nang City is spreading and receiving positive responses from the citizens
and manufacturers. Women tend to adopt greener and more sustainable
practices than men, from sorting waste, saving power and water to buying
green products. The emergence of business ecosystems with social impacts
or consumption patterns associated with circular economy is mainly
driven by women. This indicates the influence of women in changing both
consumption and production patterns toward circular economy.10

Waste management and waste-to-resource
transformation

a) Domestic solid waste

Classification of
domestic solid
waste

Collection of
domestic solid
waste

Implementing the plan of domestic solid waste classification at source, in
2020, the City completed the arrangement of 250,000 recyclable waste
classification bags for households, 110 recyclable waste collection trucks
for residential areas, 141 bins for concentrated classification of hazardous
domestic solid waste for wards and communes, 731 bins with 2 sorting
compartments on main streets and 08 bins with 3 sorting compartments
for classification of recyclable solid waste at offices. The above works have
initially produced positive results. In 2021, the rate of domestic solid waste
classification at source was 77.84% of households, 82.96% of residential
groups, 233/233 schools (100%), 67.81% of businesses and 100% of health
care facilities.

In 2020, the average total amount of domestic solid waste was about 1,087
tons per day. Compared to 2019 (with an average total amount of 1,177
tons per day), the amount of domestic solid waste decreased by 8% due to
Covid-19 pandemic. The average quantity of emissions per capita is about 1
kilogram per person per day. In the past 5 years, the City's waste collection
rate has reached about 95%.

The composition of domestic solid waste in the City has changed in the
proportion of waste types. Organic waste has the largest proportion,
accounting for 55%. The proportion of plastic waste in domestic solid waste
of Da Nang City accounts for about 14% to 21% 11.

is transferred to Khanh Son landfill in a cycle starting from the source of
waste (households, markets, commercial and service facilities, offices), to
garbage truck, garbage gathering point and finally following the truck to
the landfill.

A small portion of recyclable waste is sorted by households and collected
by street scavengers or landfill scavengers. Recyclable waste is sold to
scrap dealers, then goes from there to recycling facilities. In 2020, the
total amount of recyclable waste that Da Nang City collected through pilot
programs and projects was 200 tons, equal to the amount of recyclable
inorganic waste mixed in the total amount of waste for one day of the City.
The remaining 364 days of recyclable waste is either collected by the
informal sector or wasted.

The management and treatment of solid waste in the City in recent years
have undergone many changes, contributing to basically resolving the
problems of environmental pollution and public health caused by solid
waste. However, the infrastructure for waste collection, transportation and
treatment is not synchronous, so the ability to reuse, recycle and circulate
waste is not high. Currently, Da Nang City is building two waste incineration
plants with the total capacity of 1,650 tons per day in the form of PPP (Build
- Lease - Transfer) with minimum contract term of 25 years to resolve the
current problem of waste treatment.

In parallel with the solid waste collection process of the Department
of Natural Resources and Environment of Da Nang City, informal waste
workers are playing a key role in the waste management system12. This
workforce participates in multiple activities including collection, alongside
formal workers of URENCO. This workforce is very diverse, including
street scavengers, scavengers at Khanh Son landfill, citizens occasionally
collecting scraps during a cleanup job or independent waste workers.
Informal waste workers buy or collect scraps from households to resell to
scrap dealers which provide scraps for recycling facilities.

In Da Nang City, informal waste workers play an important role in the
recovery of recyclable waste in general, with the total collection rate of
6-7.5% of the total amount of waste brought to the landfill (about 1,000
tons per day). They buy recyclable scraps and pay money to households
(and other waste sources) when the recyclable materials are sorted at
source. Their activities are spontaneous and partly help to ensure public
services in urban areas.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY ROADMAP IN DA NANG CITY
b) Solid waste in economic sectors

Agriculture,
forestry and
fishery

Solid waste in agriculture mainly includes waste from cultivation, animal
husbandry and slaughter, aquaculture, fishing, seafood processing and
nursery-cutting of trees.

Manufacturing
and processing
industry

In Da Nang City, straw from rice cultivation has been used to produce
mushrooms and feed livestock. At the slaughterhouse, waste has not been
treated in a circular approach; most slaughterhouses in the City have not
met the national technical regulations in the field of veterinary medicine.
In seafood processing, by-products such as shrimp heads, fish heads, fish
intestines at seafood processing factories have been used to make animal
feed. Despite the positive aspects, the amount of plastic waste in agriculture
is increasing (pesticide packaging, plastic bags, mushroom growing bags,
tree nursery bags, fishing nets, etc.). The amount of plastic waste leaked
into the environment is relatively large, while the amount collected is still
treated by landfill.

IT solid waste is sorted by businesses into recyclable - reusable waste such
as: cardboard, plastic, metal, etc. and non-recyclable, non-reusable waste.
For recyclable, reusable waste, most businesses have separate contract
to sell it to on-site collectors. For normal waste that cannot be recycled -
reused (containing organic compounds, leaf litter, etc.), businesses contract
with functional units to collect and treat as regulated.

Construction

c) Wastewater

The average amount of construction solid waste in Da Nang City is estimated
at 919 tons per day; equal to one third of the amount in Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh City; and twice the amount in Hai Phong City. Construction waste
includes soil, sand, bricks, tiles, concrete, stone, wood, iron and steel, plastic,
cement packaging, paint, interior packaging, etc. While scrap is collected
by informal waste workers and some kinds of construction solid waste
are reused for ground leveling, the remaining are gathered at temporary
construction landfills or illegally disposed to vacant land lots. SATREPS13
project indicates that 06 construction solid waste landfill sites in Da Nang
City are operating illegally.

According to a survey conducted in 2021 within the framework of SATREPS
project activities,14 construction works in Da Nang City are currently using
natural materials. Recycled construction materials are rarely used.

Summary of the project "Building Da Nang City into an environment-
friendly city” in 2008 only evaluated the achievement of indicators in terms
of quantity. Accordingly, the percentage of households using clean water
was 97.83% in urban districts and 76.81% in rural areas; the rate of industrial
wastewater meeting discharge requirements was 100%. The total amount
of domestic wastewater collected by 2020 reached over 83%, the rate of
treatment meeting the standards was 50%.

2.2 Current situation of some activities supporting the develop-
ment of circular economy

For activities to support the development of circular economy, Da Nang City has promulgated
a number of important projects, regulations and action plans that have the guiding role and
also directly affect and contribute to the development of circular economy in Da Nang City.
In other words, many goals and tasks to develop circular economy have been determined for
implementation in Da Nang City. In addition, other activities (such as promotion to raise awareness,
capacity building, business support in research and application of technology and innovation,
green credit through Da Nang City Environmental Protection Fund, innovation ecosystem relevant
to circular economy, rewarding good models relevant to circular economy, acting as the focal
point for sharing circular economy initiatives in the City, database on environmental protection)
have been initially formed, which can become a driving factor in the development of circular
economy.

2.3 Overall assessment

Achievements

Da Nang City has introduced important projects, regulations and action plans related to and
directly affecting its circular economy development roadmap, especially the Scheme to develop
Da Nang City to become an environmentally friendly city in the period of 2008-2020 and 2021-
2030. Da Nang City has so far achieved important initial results as a favorable premise for the
development of a circular economy such as:

• Different environmental indicators are

achieved.

• There are numerous good practices and
initiatives on circular economy, especially
in the fields of agriculture, forestry and
fishery development, water supply and
wastewater treatment, manufacturing,
and
catering
services, etc.

accommodation

and

• The piloted eco-industrial park model
delivered positive results for potential
replication in the future.

• The awareness of citizens, enterprises
and organizations on environmental
protection is improved, in addition to
active engagement of associations such
as women’s union, veterans’ union and
youth union in environmental protection
programs.

• Waste collection for reuse and recycling
started very early in Da Nang City, partly
addressing the recycling needs.

• There have been

initial actions to
support the development of the circular
economy, which is a driving factor for the
development of the circular economy.

Limitations

However, in order to move towards a circular economy in some areas or, in the future, in all
economic sectors in Da Nang City, many limitations shall be addressed:

• The awareness, knowledge and skills of
citizens businesses, government agencies
and relevant parties are inadequate.

• Many public works and assets have not
been exploited and used effectively.

• The current solid waste management
system in Da Nang City does not support
waste circulation, with poorly organized
waste collection plus a low recycling rate.
There are no recycling and composting
plants.

• Women are in precarious work situations
and exposed to hazardous substances
and chemicals in the textile, agricultural
or waste sectors, which has not been
acknowledged for support provision.

• Many enablers deemed necessary for
the development of the circular economy
are not currently in place in Da Nang city,
such as: Public procurement has not really

been used as a lever for circular economy
projects; Existing capacity of both public
and private players is insufficient to
transition toward a circular economy;
R&D programs and training programs to
implement projects related to circular
economy are not in place; there is a lack
of circular economy related training
programs at all educational
levels;
circular economy initiatives have been
launched or piloted, but public awareness
is low and such initiatives have not been
replicated.

• There

is no clear vision, goals and

roadmap for implementation.

• An overall review has not been performed
to select areas of focus for investment as
an enabler to drive development of other
sectors in the economy.

16

Causes of limitations

• Resources for the transition toward a circular economy are missing or inadequate:

+ Developing a circular economy must be linked with innovation, adoption of advanced
technologies, creativity, new idea piloting and risk-taking.

+ Develop a circular economy requires excellent experts who can help solve problems,
from the start to the final stage of the process.

+ Enterprises shall have large and sustainable financial resources to be able to transition
toward a circular economy. In fact, converting linear production to circular economy
will require a large initial investment to replace equipment and processes, optimize the
whole system as well as deal with environmental problems. Meanwhile, businesses in
Da Nang City are mostly small, medium and micro enterprises or start-ups, with limited
resources.

• Communications and capacity building efforts are not really effective.

• Mechanisms, policies and legal systems on circular economy are in place but have not
been implemented in practice; the concept of circular economy is quite new and its
integration into existing plans is absent or limited. There is no framework to guide the
application, assessment and certification of circular economy practices.

• Deployed or piloted circular development models are on a small scale, most of which

have not been evaluated for possible replication.

• Citizens and the private sector have not been strongly engaged in waste management

while the market for environmental services has not yet developed.

• The access to concessional and green loans to invest in green and eco-friendly
production lines and technologies is quite limited, requiring time and performance of
different procedures.

• Many businesses define short-term goals only, without a long and sustainable vision;

the market demand for green and environmentally friendly products is low.

• The role of female scrap collectors in the waste value chain and in sustainable consumption
and production models is yet to be fully acknowledged; gender mainstreaming in policy
development is poor while access to financial and technical resources is limited.

• Data integration and sharing platforms for a circular economy are yet to be developed.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY ROADMAP IN DA NANG CITY
Based on 04 criteria for selecting key sectors/areas for circular economy development,
we collected data for evaluation and selection purposes. To collect primary data, we collected
expert opinions (including representatives of departments in each sector) for 14 relatively
important level-1 economic sectors of Da Nang city. In the 21 level-1 economic sub-sectors, some
sectors have been dropped before consultation (due to failure to meet the criteria at the start),
including: mining industry; activities of Party’s committees and socio-political organizations,
government management and security and defense activities; Arts and entertainment; Other
services; Activities of households as employers of domestic personnel; Activities of international
organizations and agencies.

The review of sectors/areas against selection criteria shows that there are 5 level-1 selected
economic sectors, including: Agriculture, forestry and fisheries; Manufacturing; Water supply and
wastewater treatment management; Construction and Accommodation and catering services.

However, based on past lessons learned in selecting priority areas for circular economy
development in different cities globally and the view that an interdisciplinary approach to selection
is needed to promote the circular economy in different sectors and build linkages among them
(SITRA), the following areas have been selected:

1. solid waste management (including domestic solid
waste, construction solid waste and plastic waste);

2. raw materials

3. energy

4. eco-industrial parks

5. food circulation

6. water circulation

7. green consumerism

Direction of the roadmap

The roadmap for circular economy development in Da Nang city for the period of 2022-

2030, with a vision to 2045 includes the following phases:

Lauch (2022-2025)

The launching phase emphasizes
communication, education to raise
awareness, knowledge, skills and
prepare
initial basis (in terms of
policies, capital, human resources,
roadmap, tasks, etc.) to enter the
development phase. During
this
period, the potential and benefits of
the circular economy must be widely
demonstrated. Some simple circular
economy models can begin to be
piloted and implemented at this stage.

Development (2025-2030)

In this phase, the City needs to take action and
implement pilot projects in priority areas to show
the impacting and inspiring extent when applying
circular economy. Priority areas for development
at this stage include: (1) solid waste management
(including domestic solid waste, construction solid
waste and plastic waste); (2) raw materials, (3) energy,
(4) eco-industrial parks, (5) food circulation, (6) water
circulation, and (7) green consumerism.

City-scale
deployment and
acceleration
(2030-2045)

From 2030, circular economy will become a mainstream trend. Pilot
projects/programmes are evaluated and applied in the remaining sectors.
By the end of 2045, the city will essentially meet the criteria of a circular
city.
