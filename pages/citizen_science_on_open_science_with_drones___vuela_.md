Objectives Develop scientific tools that can be useful for groups or communities tackling local and locally-defined problems, and therefore promote their participation in science. 

Description of citizen participation in "Fly":  A toolkit for open science with drones has been collaboratively prototyped to be equally accessible to marginal communities, activists or researchers. It is useful for studies or measurements for which this technology is already used but is dominated by closed-source tools.
