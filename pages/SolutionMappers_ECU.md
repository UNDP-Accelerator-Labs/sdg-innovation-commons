[[ai_summary:Paulina Jimenez, head of solutions mapping from Ecuador's accelerator lab, discussed a project aimed at preserving medicinal plants traded by producers and ragers in wholesale markets. The project involved collaborative workshops and design thinking principles to address issues such as low profit margins for vendors, reliance on middlemen, and climate change impacts. Tools like ethnographic observations and digital mapping were used to understand the market dynamics and ecosystem connections. A deliberation process led to five prototyped solutions, which were implemented with the herbalists.

# Medicinal Plant Guardians: Ecuador's Solution Mapping Journey

### [[0:00]] OK, hello\. Can you tell me more about yourself? What is your name and what do you do?

Yes, my name is Paulina Jimenez\. I'm head of solutions mapping from Ecuador's accelerator lab\.

### [[0:12]] Yes, this is Kendall Alzaim, head of solutions mapping as well from Syria\. Do you give consent to use the information that is recorded through this video?

Yes\.

### [[0:21]] OK, great\. Can you give us the title of the story that you're going to share with us today?

OK, I would name it medicinal plant for ragers and producers as guardians of ecosystems\.

### [[0:36]] Great\. Now to start, can you tell us more about your R&D journey? Where did it start?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
OK, sure\. So this is a journey with local producers and for ragers from keep those largest wholesale market dedicated to medicinal plants\. This is the mark the first tire of distribution that provides medicinal plants to the whole city and that's something positive and negative at the same time\. The positive obviously is because it provides such an important product and it's and valuable product, but at the same time it is negative because it the vendors, they encounter a lot of middle men\. So the amount of money that they make for the amount of work that they do is very little\. So basically, you know, the beginning of, of this story is getting in contact with this woman from the market\. We were invited to participate originally from by the City Museum that was working with them more from the cultural and heritage\. I asked a point of view and then we came in to work with other dimensions of their problems\. They were very open and we were very well received and we that that really enabled us to have a very participatory and collective intelligence process\. We called it Mingali novacion and that comes from a Quichua word which means actually collaboration\. That's usually Aminga is where in our community, you know, calls or convenes the community members to work together on maybe fixing road or preventing risk disaster situations\. So you know, finding a common problem and then working together for that\. So the Quechua word, I think was very compelling for them and we had this process with but, you know, basically applying design thinking, but adapting it to the context and to the culture\.

### [[2:54]] Great\. Can I ask you a question? What did actually inspire you to work with this woman?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Well being]]
Yes\. One thing is that even though the group may seem little, you know, because we are, we're supposed or we're asked to have a big impact reach, you know, very large number of let's call them beneficiaries\. We realized that one herbalist, one woman, actually in a metaphor way, it's like a Jaguar And I, I actually in a blog name them or compare them to a Jaguar\. Meaning even though you think that you're only dealing with one person, you're that person is related to a larger ecosystem and has an impact in many dimensions\. So jowers actually are like, if that the idea behind protecting jowers is when you protect one jowar, you're protecting hectares of a forest because obviously it's like they, they call them an umbrella species\. So, you know, using the metaphor of jowars, I think herbalists are also in a way, a jowar because when you protect or revalue the existence of an herbalist, you are protecting large, vast amounts of ecosystems\. You are protecting the culture, you're protecting the health of a city and recuperating also an ancestral knowledge that is not only from today, but you know, it's a yes, ancestral\.

### [[4:27]] Great\. So now to go more into depth into for the research and development elements\. Can I know like what kind of tools and methods that you use, like you mentioned you worked like on a collaborative workshops and this kind of things\. Can you go deeper and what kind of methods and tools that you actually use and you find actually beneficial?

[[tools:Design thinking]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Yes\. So the first was actually applying design thinking principles to the market, convening other actors\. It was a we had a very important alliance with the university and different five different career students in the originally around 30 students got involved by, you know, applying the, the five different principles of, of the design thinking, doing, you know, the empathizing, visiting the market\. We trained them also on ethnographic tools and observations\. They, we trained them on solutions, mapping also tools so that, you know, we started thinking together of what, what were the, I mean, the problems, these women have a lot of problems\. It was very important to also narrow down the problems and try to tackle\. We started, you know, like working around, for example, how to continue their sales when there's a weakening of relationship with clients\.You know, how much plants do they have filling the data gaps? And another problem was actually related to climate change and, and you know, very hard work of manually watering their plants\. And then another one was actually related to the aspect that I mentioned at the beginning is because they are the first tier of distribution, they distribute fresh plants\. So whatever is not sold is either lost, thrown away or, you know, given a very low prices and the idea was, you know, improving a little bit their livelihood so that that is not wasted or especially so that they can resist the idea of, you know, giving it away for almost no money\. So several ideas, around 31 ideas were came up and then five of them were prototyped and only 5 because there was a deliberation process where, you know, the herbalist themselves decided which were more likely to be, you know, feasible and which were less\. And then from those prototypes, we went into an implementation phase with them\.

### [[7:03]] That's great\. OK\. So can you mention through these methods and tools and through this journey, what kind of skills did you use like and did you have and what kind of tools you actually developed while working with this woman?

Yes, I think a lot of the tools that are already exist really need to have like an adaptation so that, you know, the herbalist could actually find them useful\. So for example, well, one of the things that we did was, you know, filling, filling certain data gaps\. And for that maybe we use more traditional methods for although even though they're traditional\.

### [[7:44]] Sorry, I meant skills\. I meant skills\. I was about to say what kind of skills you actually use? You know, it's like different whether it's like interpersonal skills, skills, OK, yeah, these kind of things\. And actually while you're doing something, sometimes you develop a set of skills that you did not actually you had it in there\. So is there such kind of moment like these kind of skills that you developed?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Adaptability]]
[[principles:Cultural adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yes\. One I would say is having like the intercultural approach and also trying to, I think that was like the most important one, being able to understand and empathize, you know, with, with the herbalists and understanding, you know, the, the, the culture around the popular market, the culture also of, of, you know, expectations also from government officials of what type of why do they regulate the way they do? But especially being able to speak on a simple language and, and accessing, you know, to them\. I would say also the mapping skill and not only mapping solutions, but actually mapping and ecosystem mapping, the connections between rurality and, and, and urban because we, we discovered that the, these categorizations are not so real\. We saw that, you know, these women and then again, going to the Jaguar metaphor are connected between rurality and urban\. These places are not so fixed\. And for that we mapped\. We use digital mapping, but also social cartography to show how the system is working around them\.

### [[9:32]] Great\. OK, now question ready to tactics\. Where did you have to be the change of course, try out new tactics to get things moving and get people on board\. Like what kind of tactics did you have to use?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
You know, one thing was, you know, really acknowledging that participants and in this case these women, they are, they're time poor\. And when they're time poor, you cannot expect them to be participating in training sessions, workshops and Co creation moments because eventually they will want to drop out\. So one of our tactics was actually adapting ourselves to their schedule\. And we did a lot of ethnographic\. I mean, I think ethnography was really crucial for that because we visited them at the market during night time because they sell their products from midnight till 8:00 in the morning\. Obviously that was challenging, but I think it was really worth it because it also we could understand the dynamics of the market much more\. We went to their households, we went to the ecosystems and walked with them where they are for aging this medicinal plants and that was that enabled a permanent observation and dialogue with them\.

### [[10:46]] Great\. So now what I want to ask you is rated more to the principle of work when the informant makes a statement with the general value like you should always ask gas route and inverters about how their work is perceived in the community\. So this sounds like a general principle for you\. Is that correct? And why is that?

I'm not sure I understood\. What is this question related to?

### [[11:12]] It's like related to principles, the principles that we apply while working with other\.

[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
OK, so definitely one principle has been and we even turned it into a slogan, which was no solution without the concerned\. So that was like a principle that was in the heart of our practice because we had ideas and we thought we even expected some to work very nicely and we had to disregard them\. For example, composting\. We thought that if, you know, we invested in a communal composter that that would solve the problem of XS and you know, throwing away their medicinal plants\. But they insisted that again that they were very poor time and that they were not going to be able to, to manage that\. So we adapted the, the model to an external externalization of, of their organic waste management\. And it has worked very nicely because obviously it took into account their, their limitations\.

### [[12:07]] Great\. Now we will go one step back to the beginning of the journey\. So you were working on a challenge\. What was actually the development challenge, if you can like state it in one sentence or something? What is the actual development challenge that you that you were working with or addressing with? And what did like situation overall look like? Was it was that like it? Was there a context that was welcoming to such a new intervention? Was there challenges? How was the situation?

OK\. So the challenge again was that the trade of medicinal plants for agers and producers was at a risk of extinction and that that was the challenge\.

### [[12:53]] And I think can I ask how was it related to sustainable development goals? Like in particular, how is this related to Oh yes, of course, like it's obvious it's related, but can you articulate like how it comes across all the SDGS?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yes\. So by revaluing the work and also by informing the local governments about the importance of these women for the ecosystems, for culture, for health, they are actually drafting a policy that recognizes them\. And that is because they want to tackle several SDGS\. This comes from the environment secretariat at the municipal level\. And so one of the SDGS is actually environment because they, because these women, you know, are walking in, in these ecosystems, they know the ecosystems and they need for their livelihoods for the plants to, you know, continue and to persist\. They are monitors in a way\. There are community monitoring these ecosystems\. So they will be recognized as such\. And that would be, I don't know, SDG 13 and also 11 like, you know, sustainable communities because their market has become the first market in Ecuador that actually uses circular economy\. You know that it has a waste management system based on circularity\. So including some sort of an inclusive market, Yes, it's a, it's an, it's an inclusive market, it's a multicultural market, but it's also now a circular market\. The waste management in Quito is, is absolutely, I mean, no market has ever done a circular model management at all\.

### [[14:40]] OK, now I wanted to ask you about the people who were actually involved, the stakeholders other than the woman that you worked with, who else was involved? What was their role?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
OK, so as I said at the beginning, the academia, OK, yes\. OK\. So the we had several partnerships\. The academia was one that was an important one\. We worked with students, with professors from 5 different careers and you know, we had this exchange of knowledges and also making sure that the academia produces a knowledge that is not theoretical, but that it's actually contributes to real problems\. Another partner with the City Museum that was a very important one because they are have made very visible that the cultural and heritage aspect of these women in this market and now the municipality has also become very interested in this work and 1:00 and it's going to be taken over right now in one minute\.

### [[15:46]] Can you tell me more about the learnings like for example, what would you do differently? Like we can think what was the first thing that comes into, into your mind that you can do differently is like, for example, something happened during the implementation that, that you think I should have done that that differently\. What are the learning, especially when it comes also to, to the catalyzing and diffusion? How do you see like these learnings that you generated can, can actually, OK, maybe at some point in the, in the project, I was, you know, I was in a rush\.

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tools:Design]]
So I was almost seeing the solution\. And then I'm, I was happy that I didn't listen to myself, but that I, I listened to the others, you know, so that was, I think an important learning and thinking about solutions that later on proved that they were, they didn't work\. Some, we had suggestions also from the City Museum that, you know, they, we how about working with special ovens\. And I'm glad that I didn't, you know, just like took a shortcut and, and, and started with a solution that seems interesting for us because it wouldn't have worked\. So that's what's, that's one thing\. Maybe I don't know if I, if I don't know if I had to do it over, but if I had to continue with this, I think I'd like to work with consumers because we've been talking a lot about the producers\. But there is, if the consumption patterns are changing, I think that's a slide that we would have to work a lot with also\.

### [[17:20]] I think that's an important one final question, how was your project or this experiment was diffused?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
OK, I think a lot of the city has begin to well, sorry again, I'm going to speak specifically of one important thing is the municipality taking over and drafting a policy\. I think that's important\. But the most important about this policy is that it really the design of it comes from the recommendations and knowledge of these women\. So this is an example of a bottom up policy because about a year ago we had actually knocked the doors of the Ministry of Environment because these women were they wanted credentials, they wanted certification, they wanted to do their work without so many obstacles because for aging medicinal plants was considered to be damaging ecosystems or to, you know, not\. It was a practice that was sometimes stopped by guards, stopped by forest guards\. But they did like this pedagogical process to authorities explaining that it's not something that takes away from nature, but it actually contributes to conserve it\. And that I think is important for like having policy makers listening to the affected and actually respecting that and designing a policy that recognizes that and that will they will actually get credentials for their work\. And also they will have, you know, like more capacity building as part of the of this policy\.

### [[19:02]] Great, thank you very much, Paulina\.

Thank you, Kenda\.
