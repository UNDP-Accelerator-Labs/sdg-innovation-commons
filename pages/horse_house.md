Horse House

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The lack of space to keep the horse safe. 

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Not only did he solve this need that he had with the horse, but also many neighbors began to consult him to rent this little house for housing. This shows the need for space on the one hand, and on the other hand that the need that many people have to have home where to live, leads some people to consider sleeping in a space as small and without comforts as where the horse sleeps.
