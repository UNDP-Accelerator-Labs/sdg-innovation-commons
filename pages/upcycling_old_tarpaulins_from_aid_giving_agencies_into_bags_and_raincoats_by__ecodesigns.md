Upcycling old aid tarpaulins into bags in the Bidibidi Refugee Settlement
EcoDesigns collects old tarpaulins from UNHCR or other aid agencies, which were given to arriving refugees for roofing. The sun is slowly destroying the plastic sheets and holes form and after a couple of years are thrown away. The social enterprise collects the sheets and uses the parts still in good condition as the base material for waterproof school bags for refugee children, handbags and shopping bags.

During COVID-19 outbreak, the enterprise started to quickly also produce face masks and was able to secure a large deal for the production of 50,000 masks through UNHCR, which are given out to the refugees in the camp.
