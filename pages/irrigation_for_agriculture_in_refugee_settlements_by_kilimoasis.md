Transforming dry soils into fertile soils through irrigation in agriculture in refugee Settlements 
KilimOasis is situated in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Uganda, which is home to over 100,000 refugees. Food rations given by the United Nations have been cut down to the bare minimum for survival due to the increase of refugees in Uganda (currently over 1,5 million) and families are malnourished.

The refugee settlement is situated around a vast lake and YesLife Scope is using a mobile water pump to make dry and infertile land suitable for agriculture. Currently, 12 families are trained in farming and watering their crops. The produce is partly consumed by the refugees to have a nutritious diet but about half of it is also sold to urban centres and Kampala. Profits are saved and after three seasons paid out to the families as start-up capital to start their own small-scale farm while new families are empowered.
