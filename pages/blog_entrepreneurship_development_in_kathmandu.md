Entrepreneurship Development in Kathmandu
AUGUST 20, 2020
With an objective to understand the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Kathmandu, UNDP Accelerator Lab in Nepal partnered with “Nepal In Data” to conduct a brief study on “Entrepreneurship Development in Kathmandu”. The study covers insights from incubation centers, entrepreneurs, academia and non-government organizations to understand the trends of the entrepreneurship eco-system such as operational continuity/ processes, existing status, performance, resources and challenges. This research serves as a knowledge product for the Lab’s experiment on Kathmandu Business Hub (K-HUB).
