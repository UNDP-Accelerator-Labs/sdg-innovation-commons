## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The specific learning intention of the "Data in Action" experiment is:

Evaluate the impact of real-time data collection by garbage trucks on the management of urban infrastructure, including potholes, light poles, and traffic lights.
Understand how Big Data technologies can improve urban planning by integrating waste management with broader municipal needs.

Why is it important to perform this experiment?
This experiment is crucial because:

Increases the efficiency of urban services by utilizing existing resources (garbage trucks) to collect comprehensive data.
Improves infrastructure maintenance by enabling real-time responses to urban problems, leading to a better quality of life for residents.

It fosters innovation in urban management, demonstrating how multipurpose data collection can revolutionize the way cities approach both waste management and infrastructure maintenance.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF garbage trucks equipped with Big Data technology and a mobile application collect data on infrastructure problems such as potholes, damaged light poles and faulty traffic lights, THEN the municipality will achieve more efficient and comprehensive urban planning

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions Taken to Test the Hypothesis:

Development and Deployment of Mobile Application:

The waste management company created and introduced the mobile app as an innovation for garbage truck drivers to report infrastructure issues during waste collection.

Training Sessions:

Drivers were trained over a specific period to use the app for collecting data on waste and urban infrastructure issues like potholes and broken light poles.

Data Collection and Upload:

Over a 4-month period, drivers collected and uploaded real-time data from various neighborhoods to the city’s urban planning Dashboard.

Real-Time Urban Planning Dashboard:

The data was analyzed in real-time, supporting urban planning decisions and waste collection optimizations.

Where, When, and With Whom:

Where: Various neighborhoods in the municipality.

When: Over a 4-month period during regular waste collection routes.

With Whom: The garbage truck drivers, the solid waste company, and the municipal urban planning department.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The original hypothesis has been confirmed, since the results showed that the use of the mobile application and Big Data technology improved both waste collection and urban planning. The municipality was given a planning dashboard that allowed them to use real-time data collected by garbage trucks to optimize routes, address infrastructure issues and improve the overall efficiency of urban management. This shows that the integration of waste collection with urban planning data supports the hypothesis and provides concrete benefits for the municipality.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

Most important learning outcomes:
Multifunctional data collection integration: Garbage trucks can effectively collect data on both waste and urban infrastructure, improving municipal planning in real time.
Improved urban planning: Real-time data enabled more efficient route optimization and faster responses to infrastructure issues.
Changes:
Expand data collection capabilities: include more urban metrics (e.g. schools, green spaces).
Ongoing Training: Regularly train drivers to maintain data accuracy and efficiency.
System expansion: gradually expand the system to cover more areas and integrate other city services.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Main obstacles and challenges:

1. Change of municipal authorities: the leadership transition interrupted the expansion and integration of the board into urban planning.
2. Political and administrative resistance: Difficulty in ensuring long-term adoption of the system due to changing priorities of the new authorities.
3. Technical and operational training: Ensuring consistent use of the platform required ongoing training and support.

Tips for colleagues:
1. Early stakeholder engagement: Involve municipal leaders early to build ownership.
3. Provide comprehensive training: regularly train staff and new authorities to maintain the use and relevance of the system.
