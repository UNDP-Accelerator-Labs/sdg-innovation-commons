Eco-Network, a youth-led organisation founded by a group of seven environmental science students from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP), aims to create an eco-friendly world. Eco-Network has arranged various campaigns to raise awareness related to Sustainable Development Goals 5, 6, 7, 13, and 15. Besides Bangladesh, the organisation currently works with 9 other countries, including Nepal, Bhutan, India, Philippines, Nigeria, Cameroon, China, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. "People from other countries showed their interest to work with us. Consequently, we took online interviews and appointed them as Regional Ambassadors of Eco-Network in their homelands," shares Shamim, the founder of Eco-Network. The organisation has an executive and a sub-executive committee, who help monitor and maintain several activities conducted by the organisation. They also have campus ambassadors from 13 universities, who are arranging awareness campaigns and workshops on environmental issues, such as climate change. Eco-Network has already collaborated with around 12 academic institutions and aims to reach young people through their campaigns soon. Econetwork aims to create awareness in the youth community, which in turn, will inspire them to take initiatives to build a greener world.
