## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Accelerating waste management practices from public institutions to indigenous communities
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to improve collaboration between public institutions and society, promoting resilience to climate change:

Entry point: Waste management involving central and local institutions, civil society to decontaminate basins and rivers meeting the national regulations.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Based on collaboration, we have created a methodology called "Transition Plans" which is an agile approach to identify a strategy that contributes to the integral management of waste and solid waste from local governments. This process makes it possible to outline actions and prioritize them within a strategic framework, which accelerates the strengthening of a legal and institutional framework, citizen participation and improvement in municipal capacities.

This has been an evolutionary process that has been led by the Acc Lab, together with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), as the maximum authority on waste management, the Department for Solid Waste Management (DIMARDS), regional and departmental delegations, local governments, citizens, and the waste collection sector.

This strategy has managed to serve 80 municipalities nationwide, that is, 25% of the national territory to date. However, the habits and patterns of consumption and garbage disposal seem not to transcend from small and large generators. Government Agreement 164-2021 establishes August 2023 as the deadline to reach a primary classification both from the population and generators, as well as in municipal services. That is why it is urgent to continue looking for models or proposals for the involvement of society, recognizing that there are differences between urban and rural territories, as well as an indigenous population that amounts to 44% of the total population in Guatemala.

We have mapped what are the scenarios if we "keep doing the same things - business as usual", and the scenarios are terrible, with water contamination, floods, poverty, loss of economic opportunities and so on. However when we imagine what it would look like if we adopt sustainable waste management, scenarios change into more healthy communities, better environmental quality, better water conditions on rivers, more attractive communities and better economic opportunities too.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

With a change of narrative, tested and confirmed, we can employ and scale grassroots solutions for waste sorting towards circularity, responding to the various territorial conditions, together with citizens, the private sector, and local authorities, demonstrating that collaboration is possible for accelerate changes on the ground towards sustainable waste management.

Solutions Mapping managed to reach 70 of 96 municipalities in the Motagua River Basin, in less time and with limited resources, than other initiatives launched from the central government. That is why, investing in the approaches proposed by the Lab, allows accelerating from the institutional framework that includes:

a) The Ministry of the Environment has adopted the methodologies and tools, scaling into new territories, through this agile approach to comply with Government Agreement 164-2021.

b) The Transition Plans methodology and complementary tools have been required to be included in a toolbox by the Ministry of the Environment and the Presidential Commission for Municipal Affairs, to share it with other municipalities at national level.

c) We have been required to facilitate a new phase of workshops with 165 municipalities to train new territories in water and solid waste management methodologies and tools, which is very positive. However, in this next cycle if it’s feasible for Solutions Mapping schedule.

d) The Binational Project for Comprehensive Management of the Motagua River Basin (between Guatemala and Honduras) led by the Ministry of Environment and UNDP - GEF, has required continuing with the strategy of conducting pilots (prototyping) in prioritized territories with citizens, taking the critical path actions identified in the transition plan, to action.

In summary, it is worth continuing to bet on the Lab since,

a) We’ve accelerated with stakeholders, because we carry a proactive and constructive narrative with each of the counterparts to help identify solutions or ways to accelerate collaboratively, from the central government, municipalities, and citizens, complying with the commitments in the agreed times.

b) Our methodologies and tools have been validated by leading institutions in waste management and we encourage more people to be trained and educated in these capacities.

c) They recognize us for facilitating workshops and field work from mapping solutions, in which we promote spaces for dialogue and collaboration, not the imposition or socialization of desktop formulas.

d) Knowledge in municipal management from mapping solutions has allowed us to generate a connection between the central entity and local governments, giving relevance to empathy and sensitivity in the limitations (especially legal and financial) faced by rural municipalities.

e) We return to the field to collaborate with citizens and especially women, that change is possible from prototyping in pilot areas towards compliance with the regulations within the time required.

As a Lab we are oriented to support the acceleration of waste management in territories of the Motagua River Basin, a UNDP-GEF Project led by the Ministry of Environment. Although, there is a PRODOC and a multi-year work plan, the Lab has shown that it can add value to this Project from the grassroots approach: with citizens. There is interest in carrying out a pilot plan that is a reference to the entire territory of the Basin.

To reach other underserved communities, we will be working on the translation of key and short messages in the 5 main Mayan languages: K'iche', Q'eqchi', Kaqchikel, Mam and A chi’.

Messages include:

• Current regulation and deadlines for waste classification

• Waste management from home

• Responsible consumption and production

We are interested in knowing your receptiveness to the different messages and how it stimulates or not greater knowledge and change in current waste management.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How could we accelerate waste management practices from central and local institutions, involving civil society to decontaminate basins and rivers meeting the national regulations?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through pilots we want to run these series of pilots, recreating the conditions for local communities in rural areas, as practical regulatory sandboxes to practice waste classification.   

With a Human Centered Design approach, we want to try again solutions towards classification, but this time in rural areas, which allow a kind of Gamification to be carried out, to identify the most efficient solutions, but also the points of improvement within the links of the recovery chain and actors involved through Behavioral Insights, and thus make the waste recovery system more robust and efficient towards recovery, that is, circular economy.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Currently, no campaigns have been carried out aimed at indigenous peoples, so we hope that the first efforts of the Lab with behavioral nudge messaging will allow us to identify the social understanding in waste management, and practices towards the circular economy in 5 Mayan linguistic communities and to identify if there can be meeting points with Ancestral knowledge.

On the other hand, there are still no characterizations of solid waste in all the municipalities, and in the few territories that, if there is a characterization, we could easily identify a "trend" in which the percentages of recyclable material, including plastics.

Additionally, and with the support of user journals, we can understand "the user experience" in the use of classification prototypes, which can also provide a social understanding to us as Lab, to the municipality and mainly to central government entities, which promoted this regulation and considered adaptation spaces.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

For these new cycles, the Ministry of the Environment has been our champion, which we have earned through the experience demonstrated in the field and now requires us to scale in new dimensions (new territories), providing our products through the Environmental Toolbox along with COPRESAM.

That is why public institutions are the main beneficiary of this stage, in which we accelerate along with local governments and citizens, strengthening ground practices in collaboration with the Binational Project for Comprehensive Management of the Motagua River Basin.

This stage is also focused on the Municipality of Río Hondo, in which they have shown a lot of interest and political will for innovation in waste management, however, this is an electoral period, and we seek to keep alive their commitment to the pilot project.
