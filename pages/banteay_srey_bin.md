Banteay Srey Bin is unique and offers interesting insight in waste separation at sub-national and community level. In search of better design and effectiveness of the bin, Banteay Srey as one of districts in Siem Reap province designs its own version of bin that talks to the need and awareness of its community. The bins come in set of two which one is for general waste and the other is for recyclable waste. This pretty bottom-line design makes an intuitive start for the public who are not well environmentally-conscious.
