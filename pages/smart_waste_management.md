## Title

Solid Waste Management
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

 Our challenge is that poor solid waste management in the City of Kigali affects public health, environment, economic and social factors such as livelihood, municipal planning, and budgeting.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Urbanization in the developing countries of Africa is on the rise, with the urban population in Africa expected to triple over the next 50 years. This rapid population growth in cities as well as secondary and emerging cities on the continent, together with rising economic growth is set to have consequences such as increased demand for affordable housing, access to transport services, water and waste management among others.  Rwanda is no exception to this, her urban population more than doubled since 2002 with associated economic transformations. The population in the city of Kigali, where much of the economic growth is generated, is expected to double by 2035 from its current population of about 1.6 million people. With the increasing growth comes an increasing generation and accumulation of waste, which if not properly handled, can pose severe threats to humans and the environment. Rwanda’s NDCs show that emissions from waste were the 3rd highest (after agriculture and energy) at 0.64 million tCO2 e, making up 12% of total emissions using the 2015 baseline year.   According to the study done in 2019 by Jerry-can Ltd, waste generation has increased over the last decade in Kigali city to around 400-800 tons per day. However, the waste generated does not equate to waste collected, a fraction of what is generated is collected (300-400). The State of Environment Outlook 2017, reports that only 2 per cent of solid waste is recycled with some plastics transferred to Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania for recycling due to inadequate systems for recycling of solid waste. Waste is currently disposed at the Nduba landfill (dumping site) in Kigali and the site is being faced with many challenges that is leachate flowing to nearby communities, unpleasant smells, groundwater pollution and existence of vermin among others. Effective and proper municipal solid waste management requires large amounts of resources, and the biggest challenges remain; effective waste segregation, collection and landfill operations.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Various research/studies on solid waste management in the city of Kigali have been carried out and recommendations made for various stakeholders on how to solve the challenge but the challenge has persisted. The Accelerator lab wants to add value by involving even the affected people by the challenge to have an end-to-end process that minimizes resources spent on municipal solid waste management, introduce waste segregation at the source/house hold level so as to increase landfill efficiency, reduce the hazardous issues to public health and optimize the entire waste management value chain.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Solid waste management is a challenge for the City of Kigali that affects public health, environment, economic and social factors such as livelihood, municipal planning, and budgeting etc.  Effective and proper municipal solid waste management requires large amounts of resources, and the biggest challenges remain; effective waste segregation, collection and landfill operations.
