    The applications of extended reality (XR) will boost the global economy by $1.5 trillion by 2030, primarily through increased productivity due to new and improved ways of working and learning. The Metaverse market is an attractive opportunity for Bangladesh to leapfrog. However, testing of the development of the XR-development talent is needed “immediately” to take advantage of the first-mover opportunity and is yet to be attempted.   The Accelerator Lab through its ‘Metaverse Development and Training for the Next Generation Bangladeshi Talent’ is preparing a youth upskilling program targeted on two fronts: (a) Assisting talented youth on learning how to program in digital twins, and in the new XR language through micro-credentials, and (b) Pilot testing the use of the training modality using XR, with VR equipment for example Oculus with students, and doing an impact evaluation more formally.
