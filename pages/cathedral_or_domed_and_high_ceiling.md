> Description of the solution

The Cathedral and Doomed ceiling are ideal for tropical climate becaus it would allow the hot air to rise cause its lighter than cool air and the cold air will flow through the house. It is a fact that high ceilings give more volume to a building for fresh air to circulate. The cool air will always be on below, while the hot air will rise.
