This project focuses on the sustainable production of insects for food and feed, highlighting the importance of accurate monitoring of temperature and humidity in their rearing. Insect farming is presented as an innovative solution in the search for sustainable protein sources, and precise control of these factors is essential to ensure their health, growth rate and nutritional quality. The development of an efficient and automated temperature control system for an insect farm for human and animal consumption has the potential to improve the quality and quantity of production, reduce operating costs and contribute to the promotion of a sustainable alternative in the food chain.
