Use of plastics to produce pins to prepare scaffolding in place of Eucalyptus tree will keep the available productive agricultural land in the nearby rural areas to produce cereal crops to feed ever growing population in the country. The pin produced from plastic bottle is strong which can be used for long time as a scaffolding as compared to scaffolding prepared from Eucalyptus tree.
