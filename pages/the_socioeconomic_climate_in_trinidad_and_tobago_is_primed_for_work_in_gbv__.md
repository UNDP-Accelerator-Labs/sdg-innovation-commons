## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The socioeconomic climate in Trinidad and Tobago is primed for work in GBV based upon recent incidents of violence against women. There have been national protests demanding more action from government in this area. 
Insight 1: Many small NGOs have formed in recent time to address the challenge of GBV.
Insight 2: Many of these organisations are informal and so do not have ready access to funding and other forms of support from the UN and development partners. 
Insight 3: Some private companies working in this space are somewhat advanced and technologically geared towards making a difference but the UN procurement infrastructure makes it difficult to partner with them in a timely manner.
Insight 4: Many of these NGOs are desirous of increasing their organisational and technical capacity since they are mainly activist organisations formed by passionate people with little technical experience. 
Insight 5: Some interventions/solutions are ready to receive financial support but because of their newness they are ineligible for some kinds of support without reputable partners.

Two approaches to GBV from the grassroots: https://theandreaproject.com/https://ttwesafe.com/ Many of the NGOs formed in response to this case, which was a breaking point for Trinidad and Tobago.  https://trinidadexpress.com/newsextra/they-killed-andrea-and-threw-her-away/article_774e45aa-6728-11eb-a392-b73a8a5ddbd7.html, given that it followed closely after other killings such as this one: https://tt.loopnews.com/content/report-missing-teens-body-found-santa-cruz

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. There were two important bottlenecks.
1. Given the speed of response from community and the bureaucratic processes at the UN (all agencies) and other development partners (e.g. the EU) it was difficult to partner and support some of these agencies.  The UN was particularly concerned about reputational risk given the age of the initiatives.
2. There was some debate over which UN agency was in the best position to provide financial support of any kind.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Given the newness of the national interest in GBV at the grassroots level because of the spate of violence against women that was covered by the media, there is little repository of tech-based or other solutions targeting GBV. We launched a call for peacebuilding solutions but kept the call very broad and included a category for women's groups, many of which deal with GBV. We also surveyed the media and several holders of solutions actually reached out to the UNDP. The Lab was only too eager to speak to them and learn from them.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

1. Crowdsourcing: The lab wanted to survey the thinking of the public by getting as wide as possible a number of solutions so we thought a public call for solutions would be best.
2. Pilots: Previous interventions in this space have tended to be less effective, as such there is a need for a innovative and tailored approach. We supported via funding, advisory support and collaboration with UN Women, a private sector agent producing widespread public education on the use of technology to prevent and safeguard women.
3. Smart cities: Given that much of the violence against women in recent times has taken place in private taxis operating in the informal sector, the Lab saw the need to investigate and document a solution that provided real-time, data-based tracking of women's locations and "certification" of taxis (formal and informal) using a QR code. This is on-going and we are currently exploring how best to support in more tangible ways. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None at this time.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None at this time.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Andrea Project
Discussions and investigation of TTWeSafe. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None at this time. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The EU through the Spotlight team (for the Andrea Project videos)

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UN Women
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The challenge approach and interviews with the private sector partners created avenues for insights for the UNDP which did not exist before.
