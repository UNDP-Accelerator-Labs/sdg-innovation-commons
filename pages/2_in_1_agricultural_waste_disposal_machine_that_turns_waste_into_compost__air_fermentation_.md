The air fermentation project is an alternative to random handling of plant waste, which has burdened municipalities with transportation and burning. The machine turns the tones of agricultural waste into compost. It is made from old neglected junk. First, the machine shreds the waste. Second, the product is collected in a metal tank where the process of air formation starts.
