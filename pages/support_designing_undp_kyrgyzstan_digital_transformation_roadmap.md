## Title

Support Digital Transformation in Kyrgyzstan
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that UNDP CO lacks holistic and coherent approach to digital transformation which impacts  sustainability of our “digital projects” and role of UNDP in supporting government in advancing digital transformation in Kyrgyzstan.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

UNDP is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and we believe in the principle of leaving no one behind. We aim to be a trusted partner, innovative and effective in our efforts to help countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). UNDP’s Digital Strategy is one of the ways to do that by fostering new collaborations, introducing structures and mechanisms to enable creativity and new approaches to be developed and implemented, and building capabilities to apply digital solutions. In the last several years, Kyrgyzstan has introduced a number of significant initiatives to move the country forward into the digital age.  The National Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic 2018-2040, the Programme of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic “Unity. Trust. Creation” 2018-2022 and the National Digital Transformation Programme “Digital Kyrgyzstan-2019-2023”, all emphasized the need for digital revolution and the use of digital tools to support the modernization of the economy.  A series of initiatives and partnerships had been launched in support of these modernization programmes, including Taza Koom, and most recently Tunduk, which aims to launch Kyrgyzstan further into the digital world.   As the government further moves forward in its policies and initiatives to move the country into the digital age, it is important to ensure a coherent, integrated and well-coordinated approach to digital transformation, to ensure not only efficiencies in digital investments, but more importantly to enhance the sustainability of these initiatives at all levels.

In pursuit of the above, it is critical for the government to have reliable partners to accompany it with technical and substantive policy guidance anchored on a whole-of-government approach, that provides long-term, sustainable perspectives and insights on digital transformation.   UNDP – along with its vast network of expertise and partners globally – is in a unique position to support these processes.  At the same time however, it will be important for UNDP Kyrgyzstan to ensure that it has the requisite expertise and capacities to support the government and its partners through this long-term process.
