> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is about vegetable growing which started about 3 years ago. I started with about 500 heads of cabbages and now I can manage 2000 steadily. I use one water pump although there are some challenges because water dries in sept/oct and also inputs are expensive

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation from my experience of 3 years I can generate income steadily for myself and others. this is so because am focusing myself to be a wholesaler instead of a retailer as am this time. For example what am experiencing is that if I grow 1000 heads of cabbages using k1500 as input and sale these heads at k5 each at wholesale I will make a profit of k3500 and a retailer will sale at k7 or k8 and also will make a profit.
my targets in this business are marketers and individuals where by the marketers will be getting at lower price than  individuals.
Innovation on the Environment could be Furthermore, a more sustainable agriculture can be achieved through innovation,
becoming a key factor to mitigate and reverse the effects of climate change, one of the
greatest challenges faced by humanity and in which agriculture has a preponderant
role. Another difficult challenge is the issue of poverty, which hinders progress, causes
marginalization and inequality for the majority of the world’s population, and which
is mostly concentrated in rural areas. Innovation represents a way for families to
overcome poverty by engaging in a more efficient, productive agriculture.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed implementation is that in 2 years I should be able to supply more than10000 heads of cabbages per quarter to the marketers at a reduced price in order to sustain this innovation and satisfaction of the market.

> Anticipated Social Impact

For example what am experiencing is that if I grow 1000 heads of cabbages using k1500 as input and sale these heads at k5 each at wholesale I will make a profit of k3500 and a retailer will sale at k7 or k8 and also will make a profit.
my targets in this business are marketers and individuals where by the marketers will be getting at lower price than  individuals.
