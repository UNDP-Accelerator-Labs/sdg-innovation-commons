> What is the estimated total cost to reproduce this solution?

To take an example, we will analyze the most popular model, it is also the largest and most expensive, called Full.

It is manufactured in 2 materials, in white Melamine and in Multilaminate veneered and polished, both 18 mm thick. The marginal contribution coefficient is 40%.

The cost of materials is $57, including packaging for delivery, and the retail price is $95. The maintenance required is the addition of water as it evaporates from the containers naturally, approximately 1 glass or table glass every 3 or 4 days. No special training is required to use it, it is very intuitive, but despite this, we provide a user manual that explains the basics and some very simple tips.

> What components/materials are needed to reproduce this solution?

The materials with which it is manufactured are boards, which make up the sides, shelves and bottoms. We use melamine, or 18 mm thick phenolic multilaminate, 4 mm glass and “U” aluminum profiles that make up the hinges for the glass and other “L” shapes to join the modules together. We also use 1 cm diameter wooden rods. It is assembled mechanically without having to produce any type of special piece, only openwork and holes in the pieces.

> Are these components/materials easily accessible locally or do they need to be imported?

These are easily accessible in the local market.

> Are there technical prerequisites, tools or infrastructure to implement this solution? (For example, is access to a power source or the Internet required?)

No specialized personnel is needed to carry it out; a source of electrical energy is needed to charge the compressor since the tools can mostly be pneumatic. Now we use power tools. (To clarify, the compressor is loaded with compressed air and then when it is unloaded due to the use of pneumatic tools, it is turned on again to have it operational again.)

> Is replicating this solution a task suited to a single person or does it require a group or team effort?

One person can perform all tasks. Although if necessary due to production needs, they can be divided into repetitive tasks and work done in series. Again without the need for specialized personnel.

> Is there documentation available, such as written guides, videos, or other forms, illustrating the process of assembling the solution and performing routine maintenance?

Yes, we have written guides, graphics and other illustrative documentation. Our latest project (in development) is to make a video course to teach the theory of the techniques and in the same package the instructions to make oneself, a conservative piece of furniture.

We have documentation and we are preparing others so that users can order the cut parts from any supplier and with those parts assemble it at home with a hobby drilling machine with minimal accessories. It should be noted that of the 4 models that we sell, 2 are made with a single board size, both sides, floor and bottom are the same in their final measurements.

> Is there an online support service or resource available to help users or their organizations implement the solution?

Yes, we have direct assistance via WhatsApp. Via e-mail or through the fan page or the online store.

> Are there any regulatory policies or procedures to consider when replicating this solution?

They do not exist.

> What special precautions should be taken when maintaining this solution?

The system works by having fruits and vegetables in the containers,   since it is put into operation with the presence of the species. It must be verified that there is no lack of water in the container and that each species is stored in the places provided for them. Users have a user guide, which we provide when making the purchase, and 2 e-books, one of which illustrates the maintenance of fruits and vegetables for a few days and the second is a compendium of recipes and methods for preserving fruits. fruits and vegetables, to have those fruits and vegetables that are not available out of season and thus enjoy them for several months.

> Is this solution designed to be accessible to women and seniors?

Yes, and it can also be used for people with mobility problems or in wheelchairs since it can be located at convenient heights or distributed as needed since they are stackable. They can also be mounted on the floor or the disassembled modules can be hung on the wall.

> Is the Solution Owner willing to spend significant time and effort in Q1 and Q2 2024 to collaborate with UNDP Accelerator Labs in the process of documenting and designing a solution plan?

> Please acknowledge: The collaboration between the Solution Holder and the UNDP Accelerator Lab does not imply any financial commitment or offer from UNDP. Furthermore, UNDP assumes no legal or financial liability which may or may not arise from the pre-project design work in relation to the expansion of the energy solution. The selection of energy solutions is based on their open source nature and lack of intellectual property protection, depending on the solution owner. The Solution Owner represents to UNDP Accelerator Lab that all information provided is accurate to the best of its knowledge and belief. The Solution Owner acknowledges its responsibility for the Solution and undertakes not to hold UNDP liable for any potential collective claims, whether monetary or non-monetary, that may arise from its sharing and use with third parties. The solution owner also expressly confirms that the solution in question is open source and does not violate any existing intellectual property rights. UNDP and its partners reserve the right to involve relevant national organizations/institutions to validate the open source nature of the solution in question. The Solution Holder expressly commits to sharing their solution globally as a contribution to the UNDP Accelerator Labs “Discover and Deploy” energy campaign and open source innovation commons.
