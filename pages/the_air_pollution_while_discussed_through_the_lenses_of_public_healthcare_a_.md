## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

The air pollution while discussed through the lenses of public healthcare and economic development, however is viewed as purely ecological issue in the mainstream narrative.

Many groups working to address the issue don't cooperate or collaborate. In some cases, like scientists and municipality workers, they don't know about each other. Despite many conflicting events and initiatives on the subject, there are lack of common platforms. 

Despite understanding of importance of systems thinking people working on the issue do not convert the understanding into actions.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally
- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We finished design session and will conduct implementation stage in 2024 with active participation of local municipality representatives.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We started from looking at the issue of air pollution and reached to conclusion of conducting tactile urbanism practices on the streets to communicate the sustainable city practices with a goal of changing citizens' behavioral patterns and decision makings that ultimately lead to contribution towards air pollution.
