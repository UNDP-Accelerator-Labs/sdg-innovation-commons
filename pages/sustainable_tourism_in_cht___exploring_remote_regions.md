Difficult to access areas in the CHT are not meeting their tourism potential, as such areas are not offering much to attract tourists. Such areas that are challenging can be made more interesting through addition of some extreme sport activities and made more expensive to access so that only those with the highest threshold for risks and adventurous will venture into those areas. It is important to note that expenses will be higher for ensuring safety of extreme sports, and hence tourists need to be informed and targeted accordingly or some form of sponsorship/subsidization will be needed.
