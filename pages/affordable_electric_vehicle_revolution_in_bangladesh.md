## Description of challenge and solution

What is the Challenge?
Globally, the automotive industry is witnessing a significant shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), with major brands and countries rapidly adopting this technology. However, in Bangladesh, where the automotive assembly industry is still developing, transitioning to electric vehicles remains a challenge. Traditional vehicles, especially in urban areas, contribute to environmental pollution and are becoming increasingly expensive due to high fuel costs and heavy taxation on imported vehicles.

What is the Solution?
Palki Motors, a local startup in Bangladesh, is addressing this challenge by planning to launch an affordable, locally assembled electric vehicle. The company is developing low-speed electric vehicles (EVs) as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for these drivers. By offering affordable, locally manufactured EVs and establishing a network of battery swap stations, Palki Motors aims to make car ownership more accessible and economically viable for about one million commercial drivers. This initiative not only seeks to enhance the financial well-being of these drivers but also aims to contribute to reducing the transportation sector's carbon footprint. Progress-wise, Palki Motors has made significant strides by building two prototypes of their affordable EVs and securing over 900 intents to purchase from potential users.

Their flagship product, a four-door, four-wheel, battery-swappable electric vehicle, is priced competitively to cater to those seeking cost-effective transportation. The startup has already generated significant interest, with over 600 signups for their first car. Palki Motors' prototype vehicles are modeled after generic Chinese electric vehicles, with 40% of the parts made in Bangladesh and the rest imported for local assembly. The EVs feature a 60V 100Ah lead-acid battery, offering a driving range of up to 150 kilometers on a single charge, and take 6-8 hours for a full charge. The cost-effectiveness of the vehicle is highlighted by a running cost of around Tk. 1.73 per kilometer.

Co-founded by Mustafa Al Momin, an electrical engineer and entrepreneur, Palki Motors aims to fill the gap in the market for efficient and affordable EVs.
