Pupils who will be enrolled in the after-school program will learn different skills. e.g
1. Garden project to produce and sell vegetables, fruit, poultry to raise money for school projects or expansion to manage feeding program.
2. Agricultural program will teach students farming techniques and they will be able to sell their product to big chain stores and the community. This will create income for the school which they will use for the saving schemes and building/rehabilitation projects.
3. Students will learn different crafts and will generate income from these crafts. This should not be used as a form of child labour and should be closely monitored by independent authorities.
4. Sports will develop discipline in students and they will be identified and trained in different disciplines that will enable them to compete in different tournaments, i,e Olympics.
Potential off-takers will be the community, supermarkets, and chain stores.

Ensure after school program curriculum is in place in line with the Ministry of Education, set time and venue, determine a budget, transportation 
Step 4
Registration of students in schools(computerized for the purpose of data collection and analysis).
Step 5
Delivery of foodstuff by suppliers/sponsors, timelines, etc
