Fisheries Digitization: HookedUp was one of the submissions received from the UNDP Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Accelerator Lab #IslandHack Hackathon challenge. HookedUp is a digital marketplace that allows fisherfolk and consumers to buy and sell fish/seafood. This solution eases the challenges fisherfolk face of balancing lengthy work schedules with selling products given the constraints presented by COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Through the online fish market, consumers and fisherfolk can enjoy a more efficient transaction process while observing regulations. This solution has the potential to be a catalyst in the modernization of the Caribbean fishing industry.
