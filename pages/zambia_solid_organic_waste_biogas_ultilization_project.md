> Title of the innovation

Zambia solid organic waste-biogas ultilization project

> Brief description of the innovation

According to this innovation,the original treatment of organic waste with a solid content of 20%,1tons of kitchen organic waste can be processed daily.the equipment covers an area of about 100m2.biogas-production about 90m3/day(approximately 145kw of electricity can be generated per/day, solid fertilizer about 260tons/day and liquid fertilizer about 1500tons/per can be produced aswell

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

According to the calculation,145kw can be produced per day.according to the electricity fee of 0.559 and 0.854(household and business)kWh the electricity income per day will be 0.559 *145=k 81household nd 0.854*145=k124 business,the annual electricity income from power generation is 81*360 =k29160 nd 124*360=44640.
Same calculations goes to the production of fertilizer.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed in a way that it will be producing electricity aswell as solid and liquid fertilizer using waste material such as human manure, kitchen waste, organic waste etc ,my implementation plan :I have engaged a certain company which have all necessary equipment for this project And relevant stakeholders and your consideration for this inovation

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve alot of Zambian lives by creating jobs, clean environment, partnership for the goals it's also creating a greater economic benefits with investor.
This innovation is really relevant and unique to the current market because it is clean energy and affordable it's going to bring about alot of change in our country
