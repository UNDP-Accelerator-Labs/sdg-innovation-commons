Avigo Finace. An inclusive finance platform for the Zambian MSME.

> Brief description of the innovation

Avigo Finance is a technology enabled application and web based platform that facilitates short-term working loans and financial literacy provider for micro, small and medium  (MSMEs) in the urban agricultural value chain. We aim to empower fruit vendors, groceries stores, small fast-food outlets, cereals shops and other food vendors by use of digital technology to offer  tools and resources, built to address Poverty's interconnected root causes in a scalable and sustainable way.

We are equipped with intimate understanding of immediate financial needs of our customer base. We seek to reorganize the agricultural value chain by empowering urban agribusiness vendors (demand side) so that they can unchain the rural farmer (supply side) for an efficient ecosystem and elevation of everyday realities. We make business growth to be as clear as glass .
