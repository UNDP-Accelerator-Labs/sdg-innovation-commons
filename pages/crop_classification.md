> Description of the solution

It offers the ability to determine crop types on a regional scale, conduct crop inventories for any vegetative season, and estimate hectarage. The process combines Sentinel - 2 time - series images with 10 - m resolution and ground data. Neural networks are then applied to detect field boundaries and classify different crop types, with the model achieving up to 90% accuracy (which can vary based on region and input data quality and completeness). The data can be visualized on a map, and users will be provided with completed cropland masks in.geotiff and.shp files.
