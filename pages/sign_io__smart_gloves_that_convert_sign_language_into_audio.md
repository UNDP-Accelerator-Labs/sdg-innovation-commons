Roy Allela, a 25-year-old engineering student invented smart gloves that he has named Sign-IO. The smart gloves auto-translate sign language into speech. The innovative student created the pair of gloves equipped with flex sensors in order to communicate with his niece who is deaf.

The smart gloves have flex sensors stitched on each finger. The sensors quantify the bend of the fingers and process the letter being signed. The gloves are then paired via Bluetooth to an app which vocalizes the letters. The gloves which can prove useful to over 30 million people across the world have an accuracy of 93 percent. The smart gloves can be customized into different superhero themes, thereby eliminating the stigma associated with deafness.
