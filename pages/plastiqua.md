## Innovative Collaboration between Bank Al Etihad and Petra Orfali

Plastiqua is a sustainability-driven initiative by Bank al Etihad in collaboration with local fashion designer Petra Orfali. It transforms used bank cards into handcrafted accessories and art pieces, promoting upcycling as a creative solution to plastic waste. The project is powered by a community of women from Jabal al Nathif, who work closely with Petra to produce these items. Through this initiative, Plastiqua not only addresses environmental challenges but also creates economic opportunities, offering a source of income and empowerment for the women involved.
