Innovator: James Rory from Malekula Island

Narrative: James Rory saw the potential in the young people of Vanuatu through their creativity with regard to music. Because the government hasn’t launched any music policy in Vanuatu, most of Vanuatu’s local musicians still struggle to promote their music at both local and global levels. James Rory developed the lokol vibes mobile application as an initiative that will help musicians in Vanuatu to protect, promote and at the same time sell their music in Vanuatu and wistfully, global as well. This app will regroup all the musicians in Vanuatu in order to build the music industry. Through the app, any individual can have access to any local songs of Vanuatu.
