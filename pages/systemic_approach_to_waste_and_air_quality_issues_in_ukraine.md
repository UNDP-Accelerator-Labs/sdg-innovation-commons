## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Waste + Air Quality
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our interconnected challenges are: open burning, open dumping and massive landfilling of waste +  Air pollution in Ukraine  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We started with open burning practices of the organic waste (dray grass and leaves) in mainly rural areas of Ukraine and arrived at bigger waste picture and general air quality situation.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Satellite images,  collective intelligence of 200 different regional communities, anthropological research, expeditions

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We are working with the cultural aspect of e.g. burning in the rural areas (topic tooo small for UNDP projects), we are applying non tradition methods to understand the problem (e.g. satellites and collective intelligence) and looking for the unusual solutions (e.g. biomimicry competition) as well as unusual partnerships (Ministry of Digitalization, Junior Academy of Science, European Space Agency)

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Understanding the air pollution and waste problems in Ukraine, by zooming into cultural roots of the problems, relying on community mapping and sensing; zooming out to the satellites; while searching for unusual solution suspects (e.g. biomimicry, nature), as well as partnerships

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1. How does the organization ecosystem of air quality in Ukraine look like, what are the gaps and leverage points? 2. How can we stop open burning and landfilling of waste in Ukraine? 3. How do we #DesignOutWaste using nature as a solution and an inspiration

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. We did assessed why people burn using ethnography, behavior insights  2. We looked at the problem from the sky-using Satellite Imagining and share knowledge with community. 3. We maped solutions (co-created a live catalog with over 40 solutions together with 200 communities in Ukraine) and have identify few ideas to test: Satellite imagining, community of practice, composting, “correct” communication.  4. We started testing those solutions: - We have tested and developed and taught 200 communities to “control” burning practices from the “sky” using Satellite Imaging  (see the web of our project). Now many communities are using this tool!  - We have tested the possibilities to composting and have created a virtual map of available composters that are collecting organics in whole Ukraine.  - We have tested idea of “do not burn” community creation – created a community of practice among 200 communities where they are actively exchanging tips and trick on how to stop burning nonstop.  5. Now we would like to test “correct” communication solution with Isobar and Amplify. The communication campaign https://xn--80aalpbbxbf1d5ah.xn--j1amh/ is very big now in Ukraine.   6. We are testing biomimicry solutions as well https://www.ua.undp.org/content/ukraine/en/home/accelerator-labs/design-out-waste-call-for-participants-in-biomimicry-design-challenge-2021.html 7. Data Visualization and Visual Thinking will help us understand the ecosystem and identify leverage points for further testing solutions

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

cultural roots of the problem, data on air quality
## Closing
