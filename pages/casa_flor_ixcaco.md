This organization seeks to be a space for the development of indigenous women in solola, through weaving, artisan cooking and sale of spices and foods originating in Guatemala. They are a cooperative that believes in fair trade and inclusion.  

The women who work at Casa Flor Ixcaco are originally from San Juan la Laguna, so it is an excellent way to promote economic and social development in the community.
