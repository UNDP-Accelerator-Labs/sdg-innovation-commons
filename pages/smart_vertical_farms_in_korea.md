> Description of the solution

Young Korean start-ups are developing smart vertical farms to tackle two main issues: lack of space and growing demand for fresh food. By using ship containers, repurposed warehouses, tunnels, and subway stations, businesses are now growing vegetables without the need of pesticides, sunlight, and soil, away from natural pollution, and with 90% less water usually needed in traditional farming. With a mix of IoTs, AI, and hydroponic technologies, these farms have the potential to become an unprecedented source of food for millions of people living in a metropolis.
