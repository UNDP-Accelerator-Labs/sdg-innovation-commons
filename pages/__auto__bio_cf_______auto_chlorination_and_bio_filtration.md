> Brief description of the innovation

the innovation is by jonzib enterprise an engineering research company ;
-the innovation is a solution to providing clean and safe water for communities in zambia 
-providing clean and safe water is gov't policy .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

-the innovation is both small and large   scale
-for a small innovation it will be to any customer such as  for boreholes ,schools ,universities and other
-for large scale it will be  sold to water utility supply company , large mining industries , other lage institutions that need clean and safe water.
- pontential offtaker  are national science and technology council,
    ntbc  and  copperbelt university.
-the challenge prize will be invested in acquisition of equipment  and operating  tools . 
-the value addition to copper produced in zambia  replacing the current situation of producing 800,000 metric tonnes copper and exporting it as anodes and cathodes.
-the bio filter replaces the slow sand filters , the bio filter conserves ecological system in swamps were sand was taken from for the slow sand filters.

> Technical Feasibility

the innovation is designed to auto chlorinate water  as it is pumped and uses a bio filter to filter impurities  in water.
-a prototype is  already there and functions  properly .
-the company is registered

> Anticipated Social Impact
