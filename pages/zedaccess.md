> Brief description of the innovation

ZedAccess is an android and ios educational system that enables pupils and parents have an easy, quick and reliable access to educational materials such as books, videos and past papers.It  aims to
 eliminate the problems of the current educational system is facing.Such problems include  , the gravity of  inconveniences weighed on parents as well as Post offices to travel long distances spending huge amount of money in order to deliver results to parents at primary and secondary levels .Thier is no quick school management system for managing payments , innadiquate learning and teaching materials in schools ,no proper record keeping of students performance at schools and no existance of a system that manages events such as  sports, JETS, and different clubs between schools.
The mentioned problems  will be achieved through learners accessing video lessons,recommended books and properly prepared and well explained notes for various subjects, books, tasks, quizzes and assignments that are the primary services offered by the platform. It addresses the issue of reducing costs of delivering results and progress reports of learners to them or their academic sponsors by being a platform on which the mentioned can be accessed through. ZedAccess is peculiar as it embraces learners from as early as pre-school to post- graduate. Its services can be purchased by various can be purchased by learners and various learning institutions on behalf of their learners so as to keep their learners engaged in academics in cases where physical classes cannot be held or even during holidays.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

ZedAcces main Source of income will be through the purchasing of its services by our target consumers who can be all learners of different ages, levels and interests country wide. A subscription fee will be charged to the institutions and learners that choose to access the services offered by the platform together with the mobile money banking sytems that will be using my platform to make an easier way of  making payments.For every transaction a percentage charge will go to me. For example, learning institutions will have to subscribe to the platform so that they can be able to post video lessons, notes or assignments to the platform and be able to send results or progress reports and interact with their learners. Learners registered individually and not through their learning institutions will also have to pay for subscription so as to access the educational materials made available by the platform. This will be very beneficial and help enhance the quality of education by increasing the access to a lot of educative information and materials that will be available and can be accessed at any time at a good and fair price. The challenge prize will be a huge stepping stone and investment that will catapult the project into action by making it easy to purchase all the required resources by a click of a button.

> Technical Feasibility

The ZedAccess platform is an android and ios app designed by implementing the concepts of mobile app development programing with a single launguage called dart programming launguage. A prototype exists and it is built using dart only. This platform will be accessible through Smartphones or any Tablet device that can properly access the internet and support its modern features. For it to be a success it needs to be properly and creatively structured with a user friendly user interface using the named programming language, it has to be connected to a billing service that will be a means of payment for the purchases of services that will be offered and it is supposed to be hosted by any company that offers hosting services. Finally proper advertisement will ensure its publicity and spread of recognition so that its services can be purchased and that the platform may start its operations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The ZedAccess app will improve and make easy the life of many learners country wide as they will have an opportunity to access a vast variety of learning and educative materials in a click of a button. Learners will be able to communicate with their teachers, fellow learners and access different academic services even when schools are closed. It will also reduce the cost guardians or academic sponsors of learners having to travel long distances or waiting for a long time due to poor service delivery just to access learners’ results and progress reports from schools. It is also very essential as it will allow and convince many leaners, schools and the entire education sector to embrace the advancement of technology and to take advantage of the introduction of Information Communication and Technology (ICT) into Zambia’s educational syllabus to improve the quality of our education as a nation and produce a computer literate and oriented work force.Therefore, in the near future, I with tirelessly effort decide to put this innovation at the international level and allow investors to come throug from various parts of the world.Iastly,development of such an innovation will put zambia on the map and  will contribute  to good  social economic relations with other countries as Zambia gets recognized.
