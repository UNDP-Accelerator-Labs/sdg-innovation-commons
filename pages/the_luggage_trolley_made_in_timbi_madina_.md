Speaking of small businesses, you can find a bit of everything there, vendors full of shoes, electronic aprons that passers-by are crazy about, especially cell phones with long charging capacity, rechargeable radios ... can pass the eyes on the big calibers: the big tradesmen who with a stroke of mastery, load more parcels therefore require more manpower as for the port of these goods towards their means of displacement. This is how our charetiers come into play. Oh yes these long metal boards intended to carry all kinds of luggage.

What struck us the most is that these baggage handlers have established a management system that allows: - or rental for paid use (billed per day). - Or the purchase for personal use (you are free to agree with the customer). - Or by joint ownership with the manufacturer (a certain percentage is paid at the end of the day). According to the citizens of Timbi Madina, this creation is original and specific to the city of Timbi Madina, something that we cannot dispute.
