Clean air is one of the most fundamental principles of life quality and well-being. Outdoor and indoor air pollutions both can contributes to human health problems. Recently, researchers found that an increase in exposure to hazardous air pollutants is associated with a 9% increase in death among patients with COVID-19. Thus, it is important to emphasize continuous real- time air quality monitoring system throughout the globe after this pandemic occurred.
AiRBOX Sense is an air quality detection system created by Dr Mohd Shahrul Mohd Nadzir. It is a device that is co-created with a PhD student from Indonesia, and it is smaller in size and more cost-effective to monitor air quality. Some of the benefits of AiRBOX Sense include:
Capability to measure real-time concentration of air pollutants for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matters (PM2.5, and PM10);
Capability to measure real-time measurement for meteorological parameters such as wind direction, wind speed, atmospheric pressure and rain fall;
Access to viability of renewable energy projects with long-term studies. 
An integrated system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), it sends real-time API data to the user through the mobile application. The application also supplies the user the locations of the installed sensors, as well as provide recommendation to the user on whether it is safe to be outdoors based on the air quality of the time.
