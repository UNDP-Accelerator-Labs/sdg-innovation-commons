Target market for school - those who can manage to pay, target market for poultry, fish, mealie meal production, salad production, Dairy production, meat production,  the minimum market is within the boarders of Zambia, the maximum , high profile market - other countries (export trading) This innovation can really bring enough money for me and my family considering the essential to society it is! This covers one of the most important human needs! for survivals, hence the demand in these products is very assuring! The workers will benefit a lot! Their salaries will be assured, they would enjoy job security, and their terminal benefits are assured, theirs is to put up a serious robust efforts, promoting the vision of the industry, all shall be well, with hard work! - the road map is there! How we wish some bailout solution could come our way! Because with Covid and definite slamp of Zambia economy its terrible! Value addition on the environment simply the development of our country! To stop being too dependant of essential life from foreign countries! Empowering the local businesses in order to empower the Zambian economy! Making our country producer and not consumer! Each Zambian be placed in production area where they are most useful to the nation! And so the areas I have hinted about are areas of my great attachment! Experience!

> Technical Feasibility

The following are to be located at the same place in Magoye - under Mazabuka District: school, Layers chickens, broilers, village chickens, fish farming, gardens! In order to have pupils do practical Agricultural projects, as required in the secondary school exam curriculum, this would give the young people knowledge that can help their private life. Land is already there, classrooms ,though need perfection, with additions needed, are their! (we are open for any inspections), after all the above projects have all become operational then! A commercial farm will be acquired in central province of Zambia! Where the maize, soya beans, sunflower crop production can be done, the Dairy production, keeping of tucks birds, keeping of goats can be done; while the processing of goats meat, tucks birds meat, and the mealie meal plant can get closer to Lusaka. Our first projects have partly started, we expect them to reach maximum within the next two years, while in the next four years all the remaining projects must be at full swing.
