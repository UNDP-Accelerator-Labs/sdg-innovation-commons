> Brief description of the innovation

There is a huge fish deficit in Zambia as a whole and Eastern province. Despite the demand, there is little to no fish production at a commercial scale to answer to the demand. Eastern province has a lot of fresh water bodies that can be used for commercial fish production. Most of our farmers have not paid much attention to aquaculture which have a readily available market and can lead to notable economic boost. This innovation would want to focus on fish farming, using our natural waters by constructing fish ponds and dams for the purpose. The project would then also promote retail fish sales and wholesale selling. There is also a plan to produce fingerings so that other farmers can have an economical source of fingerings and fish feed production. Furthermore, the project will also have to train many more farmers in the region so that there is sustainable fish production in the region and finally link the farmers to desirable market.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Fish has a very good demand in Zambia and our neighboring countries. This Project will generate income through selling of fish from our production, selling of fingerings and other inputs. The project will employ locals, which will promote poverty eradication. Since we will also be buying from other farmers, this will assist the local farmers in easy access to market. This business will also help local farmers to easily access their inputs thereby reducing the cost of production and this will directly promote growth of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in the region.  The local market will be our primary target with creation of selling points in all districts so that consumers should stop travelling long distances in order to find fish. The local supply of inputs will actually make our selling price very competitive and we have a potential of controlling the prices (because the  other Suppliers import from distant places). This innovation will promote water preservation in the region and value addition. Most importantly, if the locals are empowered, they will not engage themselves in activities that would bring about destruction of nature such as charcoal burning or other unacceptable behaviour.

> Technical Feasibility

I have both traditional and state land on which the project is to be done with plan to acquire more land in most of the districts in the region. I am targeting land which have streams or running water for easy diversion of the water to the ponds and construction of dams in order to preserve water. For fingering and feed production, to be located centrally together with a sale point for the inputs. There is need to buy necessary machinery for this production, construct necessary infrastructure and acquire vehicles for easy transportation. I have so far started building concrete ponds for fingering production (being used for fish production for now 2 ponds 10 by 20 meters and one plastic pond 10 by 15 meters), I need to build several small ones and increase water capacity (for now I only have two bore holes). I want to construct a dam across a stream on one of the lands I have in Lundazi district and construct fish ponds around it. Later on to have fish selling outlets in all the districts’ big markets. The project will be employing as per demand, and we will follow the recommended government rates.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will employ a number of experts in all fields in order for it to succeed.  We will engage so many stake holders at all levels. We will also engage in promoting aquaculture with particular focus on fish farming. This will empower the communities with knowledge and we will partner with the local farmers so that we can offer support and they pay us back in an affordable manner. In terms of feed production, the locals will also find market for selling their crop produce and others while we add value. We want to be a center of excellence so that others can come learn from us also. Having local production will directly result into affordability of the commodities by many local people and improve lives.
