Kimuli Fashionability creates upcycled fashion and accessories and empowers the Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)
Kimuli Fashionability creates upcycled fashion and accessories through training and employing persons with disabilities. African fabrics are blended with waste materials. In the absence of hearing, deaf people for example often have heightened kinesthetic and visual abilities resulting in high-quality products with love for detail.
