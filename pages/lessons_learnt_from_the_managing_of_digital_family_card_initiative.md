## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

To ensure the project's success, the project team set clear goals for the final product, agreed on implementation deadlines, and recruited a team of skilled business analysts, scoring and social policy experts. A key positive factor was the availability of the government's legislative and digital infrastructure, i.e., Smart Data Ukimet, which enabled relatively seamless data integration from various government agency databases.

 

The implementation of the Digital Family Card depended on productive teamwork among individual team members and businesses, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. In particular, the team was successful in

1. performing the integration of the government agencies' databases;

2. ensuring the relevance and completeness of the data collected by the government agencies;

3. describing the business processes of how information about an individual and a family is collected and stored in the state agency;

4. recording and describing instances of difficult living situations that an individual and/or family may have;

5. developing a methodology for identifying families based on family relationship data and creating segmentation by risk area;

6. developing a scoring model to assess social risks;

7. ensuring the protection of personal data.

 

In addition to efficient team composition and management, the success of the Digital Family Card was also due to government support for the project at the highest levels. The Prime Minister's Office protocolized instructions to government agencies to assist UNDP with project implementation. In particular, the Prime Minister's Office ensured that deadlines for implementation of tasks were agreed upon and guaranteed by the relevant government agencies, including ministries or state agencies the data of which needed to be integrated. Therefore, the willingness of government agencies to cooperate at various levels of task implementation contributed to the timely completion of the project.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The biggest challenge was the short timeframe for project implementation, which was successfully overcome through thorough planning of project activities and discussion of project components with potential partners during project design. In the midst of developments in January, government agencies and resources focused on dealing with the aftermath of the protests and unrest. As a result, there were difficulties in operational activities with government agencies, which delayed the negotiation and approval of documents. Another challenge was a change in approach to the work, as the partner did not finalize the responsible party agreement, even though this had been discussed at the beginning of the process. UNDP had to redesign the approach and fully take over the coordination and organization work, at the expense of its staff and the experts involved. In particular, the procurement process was organized in such a way that 2 companies and 11 experts were obtained within an extremely tight deadline.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

They were addressing gaps in holistic citizen data

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Innovative tools such as AI, machine learning, and Big Data help better analyse data and identify concrete social support measures to avoid duplication and improve satisfaction with the services provided. With the Digital Family Card vulnerability assessment tool, the decision on the provision of services will be transparent and efficient as it minimizes subjective human component. The solution allows target population to receive timely and appropriate support without physically going and applying for services as it is happening now. The determination on what support individuals/ families require will be based on the automated system, i.e., these individuals save time and receive a holistic support package.
