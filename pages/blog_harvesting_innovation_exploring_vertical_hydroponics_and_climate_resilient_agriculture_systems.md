By Jevon Yearwood - Digital Transformation Intern, UNDP Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean As the world faces increasing challenges related to climate change and food security, innovative farming techniques are emerging to help address these issues. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that a 1°C increase in temperature (from 1.7°C to 2.7° above pre-Industrial temperatures) could result in a 60% increase in the number of people projected to experience severe water stress from 2043 to 2071 (IPCC 2022). Currently, extreme events such as hurricanes, heat waves and droughts are becoming more common as the climate crisis worsens. Closer to home, Hurricane Beryl struck the Caribbean and North America this July, representing the earliest record of a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic.Dangerous and intensifying weather events act as constant reminders that we need to act now to combat the current climate crisis. One way to improve climate resilience and adaptive capacity of countries is hydroponics, a method of growing plants without soil that promises to revolutionize agriculture. Walkers Reserve, located in Barbados, is a pioneering facility dedicated to sustainable agriculture and climate-resilient landscapes in the Caribbean. Recently, I had the opportunity on behalf the UNDP Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean to participate in the Caribbean Climate Smart Agriculture Project workshop held at this transformative venue. This workshop was organized by the Walkers Institute for Regenerative Research, Education and Design (WIRRED) in partnership with The Caribbean Climate Smart Accelerator (CCSA), Fork Farms and Scotiabank.

Through the integration of hydroponics in the Green Economy, Caribbean nations can bolster agricultural productivity and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.

The workshop provided invaluable insights into the benefits and practical applications of vertical hydroponic farming and other innovative regenerative farming systems, focusing on the integration of advanced, but easy to operate, hydroponics technologies. As an individual who is passionate about new technological innovations and sustainability, I was excited to see how this method could potentially transform traditional farm practices in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), where access to water and space is limited. The primary focus was on vertical hydroponic technology presented by “Fork Farms(link is external)” based in Wisconsin, USA. Vertical farming technology has distinguished itself from traditional farming practices by maximizing space and resource efficiency, with hydroponics flex farms being used to maximize:• Space Efficiency: Vertical farming allows for more crops to be grown in a smaller footprint compared to traditional farming.• Water Conservation: Hydroponic systems use less water than soil-based farming.• Year-Round Production: Controlled environments enable continuous crop production, independent of seasonal changes.• Nutrient Delivery: A precise nutrient solution is delivered directly to the plant roots, ensuring optimal growth and yield.This type of technology is promising and relevant for the Caribbean region because most of the islands are water-scarce and have limited space for large-scale agricultural projects. Through the integration of hydroponics in the Green Economy, Caribbean nations can bolster agricultural productivity and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change while helping to ensure long-term food security for communities.

WIRRED is spearheading the transformation of Walkers Reserve into a living laboratory for climate resilience. Their mission is to advance sustainable agricultural practices and educate communities about the importance of environmental stewardship. During the workshop, participants participated in a guided walking tour of the area, which showcased different growing zones, sustainable projects, and a demo of WIRRED’s very own flex farm. According to Fork Farms, the systems possess the extraordinary capacity to yield more than 25 lbs. of fresh leafy greens, all within a short 28-day timeframe (Fork Farms, 2024). To do so, Fork Farms Flex Farm units leverage 288 plant spaces that recirculate nutrients and water, requiring 40% less electricity than other hydroponic technologies. Each 10-square-foot unit utilizes 98% less water and land and provides the sustainability of direct farm-to-table consumption with no requirement for chemical inputs such as pesticides and herbicides. Workshop participants had the opportunity to plant lettuce seedlings and sample fresh lettuce directly from the system. It tasted delicious!My experience at the Caribbean Climate Smart Agriculture Project workshop was nothing short of incredibly enriching. It not only deepened my understanding of vertical hydroponic farming and regenerative agriculture, but it also highlighted the critical role these sustainable practices play in building climate resilience in the region. For SIDS, innovative farming solutions like vertical hydroponics are both beneficial and essential. Our regions face unique challenges, including limited resources, as well as being highly at risk to the effects of climate change. We must remember that this is just one of the ways we can increase our adaptive capacity in SIDS, and that there is no silver bullet to combat the repercussions of the climate crisis. We all have a part to play in reducing our carbon footprint while trying to find innovative ways to live more sustainably.
