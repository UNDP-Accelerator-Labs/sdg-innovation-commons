DevoHome is a manufacturer of textiles and clothing out of hemp, an alternative to leather and fur. In their original research for creating a biodegradable and eco-friendly material, Oksana Devoe and her team found that the heat capacity of combed hemp fiber makes it an excellent insulator, comparable with sheep's wool. They focused on the insulation technology developed by animals to regulate the temperature within the fur layer, and thus created HempFur – a replacement for animal and synthetic fur, from which DevoHome produces hemp coats. The process involves developing and recreating the structure of animal fur to suit human needs – such as natural bedclothes made from hemp for hotels.
