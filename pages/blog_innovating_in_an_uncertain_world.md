3 .UNDP Accelerator Labs 2020 Annual Report

In a world shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, getting the

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development back on track

requires a whole-of-society approach. Collective action

towards the Global Goals is needed more than ever.

As UNDP’s 2020 Human Development Report points
out, we are at an unprecedented crossroads in history.
How should we react to this new age?

We believe a great transformation in how we live, work,
and cooperate is needed to change our path for the
better. This systemic change requires speed, agility, and
a bold new approach to development. UNDP, through
its Accelerator Labs, is uniquely positioned to lead on
this transformation.

A fully operational network
All 60 Accelerator Labs became fully operational in 2019,
bringing new talent and skills into UNDP. 72% of
Accelerator Lab team members were new to the UN system,
65% brought experience from the private and non-profit
sectors, academia, and government, and 24% of them
returned to their home countries to take up their new
positions.

In 2020, the 60 Accelerator Labs addressed 147
development challenges covering all 17 SDGs. They
introduce a new way to work within UNDP that consists of
identifying key learning questions and a roadmap of
activities (e.g., experiments, explorations, mapping
grassroot solutions and partnerships) to understand
sustainable development challenges better and generate
learnings faster. Last year, the Accelerator Labs also
documented over 1,700 grassroots solutions and used 48
different innovation methods and approaches.

Reporting on our learnings in a new age
This report presents the progress made by the UNDP
Accelerator Lab Network in its first year and shows how the
Labs have powered UNDP for faster learning about today’s
toughest development challenges, supported governments
with actionable insights, and acted as a catalyst for COVID-
19 recovery.

The report follows the structure of the results framework
established in the UNDP Accelerator Labs Project
Document (https://open.undp.org/projects/00116178) and
is organized as follows. Chapter 1 presents progress, key
highlights, and impact stories across the Network. Chapter
2 reports on findings generated through our partnerships.
Chapter 3 concludes with a look ahead.

Chapter 1
Strengthening capabilities, accelerating
learning, and adapting to change

Output 1: UNDP Country Offices and partners will have
increased capability for scanning, sensemaking, and
experimentation for sustainable development solutions
in 60 developing countries.

One of the primary goals of UNDP Accelerator Labs is to
make sense of our rapidly changing, complex, and
uncertain world – dynamics the pandemic compounded.
This objective is part of a wider mission for UNDP to
develop new capabilities to improve how we understand
problems and find solutions to drive forward sustainable
development with national counterparts.

To build and strengthen these new capabilities in 2020, the
60 UNDP Accelerator Labs focused on:

Accessing more diverse and better data

Listening to those who are closer to the problems

Embedding new innovation methods within UNDP

” Thanks to the
Accelerator Lab, we
were able to do surveys
and collect information
when nobody could.”

Representative, UNDP Côte
d’Ivoire

1.1. Increasing and diversifying our data sources

UNDP Accelerator Labs have diversified how UNDP captures information in

2020, such as using satellite data to combat deforestation and employing

ethnography to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable

communities. By tapping into new data sources, we can better understand

sustainable development problems. In 2020, each Accelerator Lab used on

average 7 data sources, such as geospatial data, social media data, or citizen

data.

With the onset of the pandemic, many traditional ways for UNDP to gather

data (such as door-to-door surveys) were no longer possible nor effective in

providing an accurate picture of the multidimensional global crisis. UNDP

Accelerator Labs not only overcame restrictions imposed by social distancing,

but they used the pandemic as an opportunity to innovate data collection as
a whole and tripled the data sources used from before the pandemic.

In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the

Accelerator Lab developed an

online portal for small

businesses to access real-time

economic data during the

pandemic’s initial phase. This

portal also allowed SMEs to

submit their suggestions and

information so that

government officials could

take action, bringing to life

citizen data.  Read more
[SDG 8, 11]

In Togo, radio is the main

source of information, with a

reach of approximately 5

million people. UNDP Togo,

powered by its Accelerator Lab, partnered with the Web Analysis Center
(COWEB) to develop speech-to-text data analysis of radio conversations in 5

local languages. By better understanding the opinions of Togolese about the

pandemic, they curated health content for communities that can’t be reached
via TV or social media.  [SDG 3]

Affected by the inability to collect data in person due to the pandemic, UNDP

Cambodia’s Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with its socio-economic team,

combined traditional and less-used data sources such as phone calls, survey

data, social media data, and mobile phone GPS data to better understand

the economic challenges faced by informal workers across the country during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more [SDG 8, 10, 11]

Ecuador
Case Study
Satellite data for
climate action [SDG
13, 15]

Like many countries in the Amazon region, Ecuador is losing hundreds of

hectares of rainforest each year due to non-sustainable agriculture activities

such as cutting trees to create pastureland for livestock farming.

In 2020, UNDP Ecuador, via its Accelerator Lab, decided to tap into the power

of geospatial data to identify sustainable practices for cattle farming, with the

goal of finding seeking local solutions to deforestation. This work supports

ProAmazonia, an ambitious five-year program run by UNDP and the

Ministries of Environment and Agriculture of Ecuador to reduce CO2

emissions by mitigating deforestation and promoting sustainable land-use.

Data-powered positive deviance
The Accelerator Lab in Ecuador also benefited from the partnership between

the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network and the GIZ Data Lab, piloting data-

powered positive deviance in 4 countries. This novel approach combines

uncommon and diverse data sources like open-source satellite images,

cadaster data, and national cattle vaccination registers, to find farmers who

outperform their peers with similar resources. Once these farmers are

identified through quantitative analysis of the data, qualitative field research

is done to understand uncommon behaviors or coping mechanisms that

enable them to find efficient and sustainable cattle raising practices.

Ecuador
Case Study

In less than five months, the UNDP Ecuador Accelerator Lab and GIZ Data Lab

were able to analyze the evolution of the forest coverage of 240,000

hectares between 2015 and 2020 and generate maps of land use for a total

of 11,033 farms in the Joya de los Sachas and Sucúa counties.

New government response to protect the Amazon
For the first time, the Ecuadorian government can now track deforestation

and cattle efficiency at the farm level. These land cover maps and new data

sets such as national cattle vaccination registers offer new insights about the

drivers of forest loss and farmers’ land use (percentage of soil used for crops,

pastures, and how much of it is resting for the next cycle of production). In

addition, data-powered positive deviance unlocks new opportunities for

climate action as it helps identify farmers that are actors of change,

understand their ecologically sustainable practices, and map their behaviors,

motivations, and solutions.

The maps above show the evolution of

the use of soil for each farm in Joya de los

Sachas between 2015 and 2020 and

illustrate the threat of deforestation

(+18.6%) and the increase in pastureland

areas (+13.1%) at a farm level.

As a result, important efforts are being made so that the Ministries of

Environment and Agriculture take up this work to reinforce the national

strategies aimed to protect nature and wildlife and promote sustainable

production. In 2021, ProAmazonia will include these actionable insights to

help other farmers transition to more sustainable practices.

1.2. Building collective knowledge with grassroots
innovators

With only a decade of action remaining for the 2030 sustainable

development agenda, UNDP is looking beyond business as usual, towards

radical new approaches. One of those new approaches is learning from

women and men who have managed to solve problems through ingenuity

and simple, frugal means. These grassroots innovators often face the effects

of climate change directly, live in poverty, and have a lot to contribute to

putting the planet on a more sustainable path.

As we continue to see these grassroots innovations emerge and recognize

their value, UNDP has begun to mainstream what happens in the margins by

embedding Solutions Mappers across 60 UNDP Country Offices. The role of

Solutions Mappers is to systematically identify grassroots initiatives and

surface newly understood, unmet needs of the women and men UNDP
serves to inform programming and policy making.  Read more

Creating a global platform for Solutions Mapping
In 2020, UNDP Accelerator Labs documented over 1,700 grassroots-led

solutions covering all 17 SDGs. They are aggregated in 263 different

thematic areas such as waste management, health, protecting the

environment, digital transformation, and education.

The global team developed a global

Solutions Mapping platform to document,

share, and analyze all the solutions

identified. Thanks to this knowledge

management hub, the Labs can identify

replicable or scalable solutions and draw

additional learning from patterns across

solutions and the unmet needs they are

signaling.

As an extension to this work, UNDP
partnered with Hyundai Motor Company

to source solutions from the wider public

and make them openly available. We will

explore this partnership in more depth in

Chapter 1, output 3.

Case Study
AI & the Internet of
Things to reduce
lost water [SDG 6,
8, 11]

Engineer Issa Dababat, the Executive Manager of the Joint Water and

Sanitation Services Council in Tubas district, Palestine, cares and knows a lot

about water, a very limited resource in the region. His role is to ensure that

high-quality water is properly distributed to the local population and

wastewater is correctly treated.

In need of real-time data
Every day he faces two harsh realities. First, water is scarce. Many Palestinians

survive with only 73 liters/capita/day – well below the 100 liters/capita/day

recommended by the WHO. Second, physical leakages in

the public water networks, metering inaccuracies, theft,

and other issues cause US$45 million of water loss every

year.

Mr. Dababat needs to know where issues are in the water

infrastructure in real-time so he and his team can fix them

quickly and minimize losses. But tracking a water leakage

in kilometers of pipelines can be like finding a needle in a

haystack.

When local also means frugal
In 2020, the Accelerator Lab at UNDP Programme of

Assistance to the Palestinian People identified FlowLess, a

local start-up with a solution tailored to the Palestinian

context.

FlowLess’s solution is smart and affordable: It uses the

Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to

detect water loss. Smart sensors are installed across the

water network and feed into a dashboard with new

information every 15 minutes. This means that Mr. Dababat

can immediately spot irregularities in the water flow and

know where to act. This solution is not just fast and reliable

– it used to take Mr. Dababat several months to spot the

exact location of issues and it also reduces public costs by

78%.

This is an example of the value the Accelerator Labs are
providing to decision-makers – supporting critical work by

identifying innovative practices and linking up unlikely partnerships.

Thanks to a local innovation identified by

the UNDP Accelerator Lab, Dababat can

now fix any faulty water meter quickly and

cheaply.

“FlowLess’s smart and local system was easily installed on the existing water

infrastructure without any major investment. Its adaptability and ability to

integrate between different technologies is remarkable,” concludes Mr.

Dababat.

Ibrahim, promoter of the circular economy in Ghana [SDG 5, 8, 11, 12]
In Accra, Ghana, Bari Alinko Ibrahim collects 2 tons of plastic waste every

week, keeping it out of the city’s landfills and drains and, ultimately, the

ocean. He developed "plastic wood" by upcycling this waste into a

sustainable wood replacement. Creating plastic wood is also employing 30

people, mostly women, who could otherwise be destitute or further
marginalized.  Watch the video

The UNDP Accelerator Lab Ghana team documented this solution and

connected the community of waste pickers (led by Ibrahim) with city

policymakers to help them recognize the tangible contribution of these waste

pickers to a cleaner, more sustainable and equitable city.

Zephyrin brings frugal innovation to Congolese farmers [SDG 1, 2, 8]
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zephyrin Ndombi Ndombasi saw

an opportunity to improve cassava farmers’ income and productivity. This

crop is critically important in the fight against hunger, but fewer farmers are

cultivating it due to the intense efforts required for production. To solve this

challenge, Zephyrin invented Zongo III, a cassava peeler that improves
productivity by 67% and reduces costs by 75%.  Watch the video

The UNDP Accelerator Labs in DRC provided Zephyrin with business

coaching, mentorship, and media visibility, which has brought in many

networking opportunities with strategic stakeholders to help scale his

solution.

Piso-gadgets providing essential services to low-income communities in

the Philippines [SDG 1, 10, 11]

In the Philippines, the UNDP Accelerator Lab identified local innovators

building one-piso coin-operated vending machines made from hacked
electronic gadgets and wooden boxes that resemble a 1980s-era arcade

game. Some of the services provided by these vending-machines are as

essential as water by the glass or 5 minutes of internet connection. Without

these piso-gadgets, the most vulnerable communities of Quiapo, a very poor
area of Manila, wouldn’t be able to afford these goods and services.  Read

UNDP Philippines Accelerator Lab partnered with the Department of Science

and Technology to map this type of grassroots innovations and is sharing

findings with policymakers so that they can better understand the nation's

needs.

1.3. Bringing a wide variety of methods to find, test, and
iterate solutions

By introducing innovation methods such as participatory design, futures

analysis, or prototyping, UNDP Accelerator Labs are finding new ways of

making sense of complex challenges. In 2020, the Accelerator Labs used 48

different innovation methods and approaches in their learning cycles.

Innovation methods in practice
Solutions Mapping is the most widely used innovation method in the

Accelerator Labs Network. The Accelerator Lab at UNDP Iraq has gone the

extra mile by mapping solutions not just for their use but making the

database of solutions available to the wider community through an open

platform, allowing innovators to connect amongst each other.
 Discover their platform

Citizen Science is a

method that promotes the

participation of the

general public in scientific

research or data

generation. The UNDP

Argentina Accelerator Lab

partnered with a local

municipality to collect

real-time air pollution data

through sensors attached

to commuters’ bicycles. As

citizens ride their bikes,

they produce valuable

information about the

city’s air quality.

Hackathons bring new

energy and open the door for citizens to solve problems. UNDP South

Africa, powered by its Accelerator Lab, organized a 3-day hackathon to co-

design and build COVID-19 response gear like Oximeters, or small devices

that clip onto a patient’s finger (or other body parts) to measure the level of

oxygen in the blood. They also developed affordable contactless hand

sanitizers.

Output 2: Scaling new sustainable development
solutions at the country level as part of UNDP’s
country program and operations, national policy
and/or local markets

As the Accelerator Lab Network continues to learn and
surface solutions, one key objective is to embed our suite
of innovation practices and methods into UNDP country
programs and as part of the toolbox for the wider
development community. To deliver on this output, in 2020
the Network worked through three areas of action:

Sharing learnings on sustainable development
challenges with the public by working out loud and
leveraging multiple digital and traditional media
channels. In 2020, the Accelerator Labs published 360
blog piece – one a day – on key development
challenges and learning processes.

Providing government partners with tools to explore and
grow portfolios of development solutions. This has
proven particularly relevant in the wake of the pandemic,
as governments and other partners have adopted some
of the Accelerator Labs’ tools to help deliver their
COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. In 2020, 18
government counterparts adopted a selection of
Accelerator Lab’s tools and methods, and we present
some examples in this section.

Finally, the Accelerator Lab Network aims to influence
how UNDP Country Offices think about and deliver
development by embedding innovation.

15 .UNDP Accelerator Labs 2020 Annual Report

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the majority of Accelerator Labs rapidly

pivoted to agile socio-economic response and created, in a matter of a few

weeks, 70 new action learning plans. The aim was to drive forward UNDP’s

Integrated Response to mitigate the crisis, protect people, and encourage

socio-economic recovery. In so doing, the Accelerator Labs:

Boosted UNDP’s capacity to deliver on its mandate of leading socio-

economy recovery across the UN system, and

Enabled governments to respond more effectively to citizens’ needs

during the crisis.

Empowering policymakers to make better data-informed decisions
The Accelerator Labs catalyzed UNDP’s capacity to collect data – more rapidly

and from new sources – and provided razor-sharp insight into socio-

economic impacts through mapping the constantly shifting terrain of the

crisis.

UNDP Bosnia and Herzegovina powered by its Accelerator Lab launched

Economic Pulse, a dashboard that crosses monthly survey data from 1,000+

companies with government data to provide a close-to-real-time assessment

of local economies. Thanks to these data UNDP is now focused on targeted

private sector support mechanisms and assisting the government to design
improved budgetary allocations.  Read more [SDG 8, 11]

Highlight: COVID-

UNDP Philippines through its Accelerator Lab spearheaded two rapid

response socio-economic surveys to guide government recovery efforts.

Leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data visualization

platforms deployed through social media, these surveys reached a qualified

audience totaling 4,700 individuals. As a result, the Departments of Trade &

Industry and Social Welfare & Development are using the data to inform their
decision making.  Read more here and here [SDG 1, 8, 10]

Digitizing informality
Social assistance accounts for nearly 90% of government COVID-19 response

measures in low-income countries, with cash transfers the most popular tool,

totaling 429 programs in 166 countries (World Bank 2020, via Ugo Gentilini).

While social assistance measures included a planned reach of 1.82 billion

people, they only effectively reached 1.28 billion – allowing over 50 million

people to fall through the cracks, notably due to financial or digital exclusion.

UNDP Accelerator Labs stepped in to help solve this critical challenge by

using digital tools to create financial solutions for excluded groups and boost

income streams for informal businesses.

In UNDP Argentina, the team launched the #CashWithNoAccount campaign

to promote tools for unbanked people to access ATMs and emergency

income, such as familiarizing people with how to use debit cards to purchase
goods and withdraw cash.  Read more [SDG 10]

The UNDP Accelerator Labs in Kenya and Uganda

mapped the integral role of mobile money not only in

supporting social distancing efforts but also in

allowing unbanked people to access cash transfers

and mutual aid schemes. By identifying creative ways

to plug excluded groups into the financial system, the

labs helped governments catalyze digital
transformation in times of national crisis.  Read

Deforestation as a multidimensional issue
Due to human migratory patterns, Uganda is at risk of losing its forests in the

next 40 years. When forests are endangered, other issues loom: reduced

biodiversity, increased risks of natural disasters, and weakened food security

for millions.

The UNDP Accelerator Lab introduced thfe Ugandan National Forest

Authority (NFA) to collective intelligence, sensemaking workshops, field visits,

and experimentation to enable an enhanced analysis of the problem and

reframe their response.

New experiments
The Accelerator Lab organized an Innovation Challenge to source bottom-up

solutions. The team was pleased to receive a submission from the National

Electricity Regulatory Board (Umeme) to experiment with a new electricity fee

attractive enough to encourage people to move away from charcoal. The

experiment will start with Umeme and a major hospital to identify the best

tariff for electricity, which is currently not affordable for most individuals and

large institutions.

New data for faster and more reliable decision-making
With the support of UN Global Pulse and the UN data working group, the

UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab developed a platform to collect real-time data

of the forest coverage. This platform is fed by satellite imagery and pictures

taken by local forest guards like Florence Nadunga (see

photo) via a mobile app. The synchronizing of on- and

offline data and a real-time dashboard helps the

government get reliable maps within a month,

instead of 1 year.

Our impact
The Ugandan authorities have traditionally relied on

outdated data to understand the scope of deforestation

or sending soldiers to deter illegal loggers. Since

implementing a portfolio approach inspired by the
Accelerator Labs, the NFA is now taking into account

wider socio-cultural factors leading to deforestation.

Through this and other measures, the impact potential is

immense: authorities will be able to track illegal tree

cutting activities much more accurately. They will also be

able to incentivize and monitor tree-planting activities and other policies in

real-time. The project will also show an accurate picture of refugee activities

and help prevent natural disasters.
 Read more here and here

What do we mean by adopting a portfolio approach?
A portfolio approach entails more than lining up a set of activities on a single

topic. It involves moving from funneling activities to layering them.

Funneling activities is like planting as many "seeds" (start-ups, solutions, new

partnerships) as possible and waiting to see which one grows. It entails a

process of elimination. We believe this approach is not the best one to

address complex problems because a single activity only tackles one

dimension of the problem. Resources are wasted in accelerating activities that

may not be implemented in the end.

Layering activities as per a portfolio approach allows multiple learnings to be

developed simultaneously. The benefits of gathering a critical mass of options
are mutually reinforcing and include:

Addressing the different dimensions of wicked or complex problems,

Allowing for better learning over time,

Easier adoption by relevant (and multiple) stakeholders; and

Providing decision-makers with a broader set of options to act upon.

To learn fast in this complex world and equip decision-makers with actionable

insights, the UNDP Accelerator Labs move away from linear planning and

single-point solution and adopt a portfolio approach.

Co-building the “Participatory Informal Employment Laboratory” in
Paraguay
In response to elevated levels of unemployment, the Paraguay Ministry of

Labor, Employment and Social Security launched one of the first public

innovation labs in the country in July 2020, supported by the UNDP

Accelerator Lab and ILO.

UNDP Paraguay powered by its Accelerator Lab and ILO has been
instrumental in setting up the new Lab, which aims to innovate social security

policies by generating learning loops – building on Accelerator Lab

methodology. The new Lab’s activities kicked off with a series of training

sessions on human-centered design, value chain analysis, field experiment

methodologies for public policy, and value chains in Paraguay’s

Da Nang is one of Viet Nam’s largest cities and a major tourism destination.

Tourism provides critical revenues, but the sector’s potential is limited by a

quiet nightlife.

To take advantage of this opportunity to generate jobs and income, the

UNDP Accelerator Lab in Viet Nam signed an MOU with the Municipality of

Da Nang to set up a “City Lab.”

As part of this strategic partnership, the Accelerator Lab is drawing on lessons

learned in Mexico City and London on how to design a nightlife environment

strategically. The “City Lab” drives the redevelopment of a night economy in

Output 3: Establishment of a global learning and
scaling network

Over the last 15 years, the number of social enterprises,
impact hubs, and innovation labs created in the public and
private sectors have increased. We have also seen iterative
approaches like design thinking and adaptive management
become more widely adopted in the business and social
spheres. While these efforts have generated meaningful
learnings, their collective impact is restricted by a lack of
scale and limited uptake in the places that need them the
most. The Accelerator Lab Network was set up and
equipped to fill in the gaps of previous efforts to forge
collective impact rapidly.

We measure our progress in this area in four ways:

Size and density of the network effects among the
Accelerator Labs;

Number of new models, approaches, and insights
documented and disseminated throughout the Network;

Engagement of the broader development ecosystem
with shared learnings from the Accelerator Lab Network;
and

Degree of influence the learnings and methods of the
Accelerator Lab Network have on the broader
development ecosystem’s discourse.

A dynamic (virtual) global learning network

One of the original intentions of establishing the UNDP
Accelerator Labs Network was to provide space and time
for collaboration and exchange of lessons and insights
across sectors, borders, and time zones. Due to the
pandemic, most physical exchanges were not possible, but
we were able to create a vibrant virtual learning network.
The global team hosts curated video calls weekly, providing
all 200+ team members worldwide a space to share their
work and learnings while also inviting guests from inside

21 .UNDP Accelerator Labs 2020 Annual Report

and outside UNDP to deepen the Network’s knowledge in
specific thematic areas.

Additionally, Labs interact with each other through self-
emergent conversations and exchanges in WhatsApp
groups and more formal channels on Microsoft Teams. The
global team, with the support of its data scientist, put
together different social listening mechanisms to surface
learnings across myriad diffuse conversations and identify

patterns in a round-
the-clock stream of
information.

These interactions are
heterogeneous,
transcend regional
boundaries, and
promote thematically
and geographically
diverse conversations.

Data across the main 3 WhatsApp channels used
to understand, support, and learn from the
Network. In 2020, up to 296 messages were
exchanged per day.

Influencing the development ecosystem’s discourse
Simultaneously, the Accelerator Lab Network engages
directly with the broader ecosystem of development. Our
practice of “working out loud” and strong social media
presence enable us to reach the general public effectively
and around the clock.

The Accelerator Lab Network’s global audience grew by a
monthly average of 5% on Twitter and a 60% on
LinkedIn. We also observed an increased presence of
leaders in the development and innovation sectors
following our accounts and amplifying our messages.

Various publications featured our work in 2020, showcasing
the Accelerator Labs’ ability to influence the development
and innovation ecosystem. These international publications,

22 .UNDP Accelerator Labs 2020 Annual Report

such as MIT Sloan Management Review and Fast Company,
with audiences primarily in the private sector (traditionally
thought to be the hotbed of innovation), profiled our work
as exemplary for the public and private sector alike –
helping to mainstream our efforts and build a cross-sector
movement. This helps mainstream our efforts and build a
cross-sector movement.

Also reflecting on network effects, we received numerous
incoming collaboration requests and offers from
universities, research centers, and other innovation
institutions (described in Chapter 2, Partnerships).

Tapping into the trends in the gaming and digital industries, the UNDP
Accelerator Labs in India, Morocco, Cabo Verde, and Timor-Leste saw an
opportunity to address a major challenge of 2020: the spread of
misinformation about COVID-19.

CoronaChampion 1.0: combatting misinformation playfully
Together with IPE Global Centre for Knowledge and Development, the UNDP

India Accelerator Lab developed CoronaChampion 1.0, a game aimed at

debunking myths around COVID-19. It enables active social media users,

youth groups, community champions, students, and civil society

organizations to access life-saving information on COVID-19.

The mobile game is intuitive and educational, thanks to its simple user

design experience and engaging avatar, the CoronaChampion boy. Users are

asked to answer true or false to ten statements about COVID-19 and receive
immediate feedback with a brief educational explanation.

When the UNDP Accelerator Lab team in India shared the CoronaChampion

initiative, the learning network effect was immediate. Within a matter of

weeks, the UNDP Accelerator Lab teams in Morocco, Cabo Verde, and Timor-

Leste adopted the idea and embedded it into their activities.

UNDP Timor Leste powered by its
Accelerator Lab worked with social media
influencers to promote the game which
reached 170k young people.

Adoption and adaptation in the Accelerator Lab Network and government
In Morocco, the team launched the CoronaChampion 1.0 game as part of a

UNDP initiative called AKID2030 - COVID-19 (Arabic for “certainty”). The

UNDP Cabo Verde Accelerator Lab deployed the game at schools and

universities to reach more children and teenagers. In Timor Leste, the UNDP

Accelerator Lab launched the game together with the Ministry of Health.

Director-General Mrs. Odete Da Silva Viegas saw it as a way to provide life-

saving information and help reduce panic and anxiety in communities. Since

then, the Ministry of Health promoted the CoronaChampion 1.0 through their

newly developed Whatsapp ChatBot, supported by Catalpa International, an

international NGO. To date, the chatbot has been used by over 10,000 people

in Timor Leste.

Addressing gender inequalities
To explore the pandemic’s disproportionate impacts on women and girls

affected by extreme poverty, precarious economic security,
unpaid care duties, and domestic violence, the UNDP India

Accelerator Lab decided to launch a second version of the

game, CoronaChampion 2.0, this time with a female avatar. The

team promoted CoronaChampion 2.0 on social media, which

helped reach 6 million young people and expose them to

accurate information in a fun way. In India specifically, over

18,000 people played the game, 11,000 of whom were under

the age of 19.

Across its two versions, the game is now available in 12

languages: English, French, Portuguese, Arabic, Tetum, Creole,

French, and seven Indian languages (Hindi, Bangla, Tamil,

Gujarati, Telugu, Marathi, and Malayalam).

Blue Economy for Green Islands
In 2020, the UNDP Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean
renewed its focus on the Blue Economy in the ‘new normal.’ With the

pandemic severely disrupting tourism, Small Island Developing States

(SIDS) in the Eastern Caribbean region such as Barbados, the British Virgin
Islands, and Dominica had to adapt to a new reality.

How could the Accelerator Lab strengthen ocean-based economic sectors in

a way that promotes the sustainable use of ocean resources? Throughout the

year, the Lab focused on boosting a more sustainable form of tourism and

supporting fisheries to generate income, reduce waste, and increase
renewable energy use.

25 .UNDP Accelerator Labs 2020 Annual Report

In search of sustainable solutions to build climate

resilience

First, the team experimented with blockchain

technology to improve the traceability of high quality

and locally fished tuna throughout the supply chain.

The Lab also trained fisherfolk on handling the practice.

To support fisheries, the Lab is experimenting with

using semi-autonomous underwater drones

combined with deep machine learning and modern

artificial intelligence capabilities for monitoring and

conservation of marine life such as coral reefs and

associated species.

In renewables, UNDP Barbados and Eastern Caribbean

experimented with the potential of sargassum

seaweed and other organic waste to create biofuel for

energy and heating generation. The team is exploring the potential to
develop a commercial model based on the conversion of local fish waste
into energy, which could reduce carbon emissions and increase access to

clean power while lowering costs for producers and vendors.

In terms of waste management, the Lab is experimenting with sargassum

seaweed and local starch food waste to create non-food bioplastic

packaging. The Accelerator Lab tests various crop sources for bioplastics that

could reduce the negative impacts of sargassum on the tourism and fishery

industries and minimize marine pollution from plastic packaging.

Zero-waste future
and Collective
Intelligence
Disseminating a new

approach [SDG 12]

Waste management is a far-reaching problem embedded in, and constituting,

a complex system. It is influenced by a web of interactions between citizens,

informal waste collectors, municipal disposal services, and private companies
and is affected by various environmental, social, and economic factors.

In 2020, 13 Accelerator Labs identified a zero-waste future as a key
priority and used Collective Intelligence to help solve it. Collective

Intelligence design is a suite of methods that aims to mobilize both human

and machine intelligence more effectively. As a practice, it brings together

citizen participation, big data, and digital technologies like AI to solve

complex problems.

Engaging with waste workers

in Viet Nam

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in

Viet Nam recruited nine waste

workers and attached GPS

trackers to their bicycles to

map their routes in two

districts in Da Nang City. The

tracker’s data created 39

maps that helped build the

most comprehensive and up-

to-date overview of waste

management infrastructure in

the surveyed areas. The team
also conducted interviews

with the informal workers to

capture their concerns and

potential vulnerabilities in the

waste management system.

Insights from these interviews helped them to interpret the patterns in the

data. The data revealed that waste workers covered official dumpsites, as well

as smaller alleyways and streets along roadsides that are not served by

municipal collection services.

Tackling air pollution in Ukraine
In Ukraine, open burning of waste is a widespread practice with deep roots

in the country’s culture and agricultural economy. To understand the scale

and locations of open burning across the country, UNDP Ukraine’s

Accelerator Lab created a near real-time map of open burning countrywide.

The team used untraditional data sources like satellite images, GIS, and

citizen-generated reports of fires to produce an interactive dashboard. They

worked together with community groups from across the country and local

policymakers to interpret and discuss the data over a series of ten online

meetings. The Lab also mapped over 367 individuals and organizations

already composting waste as an alternative to open burning – demonstrating

that local solutions already exist.

Citizen-generated data make the invisible visible in Lao PDR
The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Lao PDR used a combination of methods,

including GIS mapping with satellite data, deliberation, co-creation, and

participatory mapping in communities to create detailed maps of open

burning in three villages near the capital of Vientiane. In these locations,

open burning was taking place despite the municipality’s provision of waste

management services.

Partnerships: the core of our network

Building and strengthening alliances is the core of
UNDP and the Accelerator Labs’ model. As the Network
operated in full swing by early 2020, we focused on
exploring and nurturing a growing range of
partnerships at the global, national, and local levels.

This chapter presents an overview of the strategic partners
we engaged with in 2020 and showcases how these
relationships help the Accelerator Labs Network expand its
reach and potential. We will zoom in on key partnerships at
a global level, with the private sector, within the UN family,

Turning to the country level, the UNDP Accelerator Labs established 520

partnerships in 2020 with 5 main categories of organizations.

98% of the Labs partnered with governments;

93% with private sector actors;

86% with civil society organizations;

88% with academia; and

76% Labs partnered with other United Nations entities

Here we present a selection of highlights from these local partnerships.

Nature-inspired innovation in Ukraine
UNDP Ukraine, powered by its Accelerator Lab, together with the US-based

Biomimicry Institute and four Ukrainian NGOs, organized a national selection

round for the Global Biomimicry Challenge. A competition for students and

professionals to address global issues with nature-inspired solutions.

The three finalists from Ukraine, ecoPod, DevoHome, and Natural Surfaces,

received support from mentors to further develop their proposals. As a result,

DevoHome was able to successfully prototype hemp fur, a plant-based fabric

that could become an alternative to animal and synthetic furs, a sector

gaining traction in Ukraine. Demonstrating the “network effect” of UNDP

Accelerator Labs, this inspired the UNDP Tunisia Accelerator Lab to use

biomimicry to boost citizen participation.

Business continuity via e-commerce in Uganda
In Uganda, 80% of the labor force works in the informal sector, in which

women and youth are over-represented. Many of these farmers and sellers

were heavily impacted by the pandemic, unable to earn an income due to

confinement. Through its Accelerator Lab, UNDP Uganda partnered with

leading online shopping platform Jumia Food Uganda to enable 2,000

vendors to sell their produce online.

This partnership rallied actors from the government, such as the Ministry of

Trade, Industry, and Cooperatives, to build a regulatory framework and policy
for e-commerce to facilitate a conducive working environment, facilitating

scale-up of e-commerce platforms and adoption by small and large

businesses. This partnership has also led to other private sector partners, such

as ABSA Bank, broadening digital payment channels and supporting MSMEs

with business development services and nano and micro-financing.

the ongoing iteration and improvement of our model.

Knowledge is power
We deepened our partnership with Nesta’s Center for Collective

Intelligence Design in 2020 to respond to a growing number of UNDP

Accelerator Labs working in the area of waste management. Nesta delivered a

global learning track for 13 Accelerator Labs to understand and apply

collective intelligence to mapping waste systems, including informal parts of

the system, and move towards collective action (see Chapter 1, output 3).

We also advanced the partnership with the Grassroots Innovation

Augmentation Network, known as the Honeybee Network, in India. Core

activities include delivering a Massive Open Online Course (“MOOC”) on
grassroots innovations, designed to build skills among Heads of Solutions

Mapping, increased network learning, and beginning of codification of

Solutions Mapping as a programmatic practice.

Furthermore, UNDP Accelerator Labs strengthened the partnership with the

MIT Lab convened by Professor Eric von Hippel. This knowledge partnership

contributes rich thinking on bottom-up innovation to UNDP Accelerator Labs

and has opened doors to numerous other exchanges.

Other partnerships with academic partners continue to advance. These

include:

Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) (digital data

innovation, analysis and skills building): UNDP and QCRI have scoped

out curricula for tapping into new data sources using computational

social science techniques. The planned set of courses include what

can be done with social media data, satelitte imagery, mobile phone

UNDP Accelerator Labs proactively sought to expand its network of private

sector partners in 2020 to bring in cutting-edge insights from innovation

communities and entrepreneurs, the energy and dynamism of new ways of

working, and expanded resources.

Combatting misinformation with TED
UNDP has an active interest in combatting misinformation, a need that

has become more pressing with citizens’ growing mistrust of governments and

mainstream media. To support this work, UNDP Accelerator Labs forged a

new partnership with TED, the non-profit organization known for curating
global thought-leadership events. The partnership enables the TED Healthy

Internet Project to accelerate testing and generate actionable data around a

prototype tool to detect online misinformation. The UNDP Accelerator Labs in

Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Sudan, Namibia, Kenya, Togo, and Argentina

will facilitate testing of the tool through their network of partners.

Reimagining the Blue Economy with ACTAI

Innovative finance
While funded entirely by public sector donors to date, UNDP Accelerator Labs

initiated a private sector resource mobilization strategy in 2020. Through

Q2 and Q3, the global team created and refined the strategy with input from

UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner, resulting in an approach that prioritizes

innovative philanthropists who align closely with UNDP values and can

make high-value contributions. Implementation began in Q4 with outreach to
top donors and will continue through 2021, aiming to raise US$10-20 million.

In pursuing this strategy, UNDP Accelerator Labs is helping to create new
organizational processes for managing private-sector donors, both in terms

of risk assessment and receipt and management of non-traditional revenue

sources. These systems will allow UNDP to capitalize on trends towards

diversified funding opportunities in development and contribute to the

thematic embrace of innovation throughout the organization.

Closing remarks

2020 was a year like no other. The Accelerator Lab
Network, supported by its founding investors Germany
and Qatar, has been a key pillar in accelerating the
organization’s learning on how to advance sustainable
development during protracted uncertainty.

The Network adapted to an uncertain and fast
changing year and delivered results towards outcomes
agreed in the Project Document. In this report, we
describe, through several examples, how
#NextGenUNDP’s Accelerator Lab Network came to
the fore in UNDP’s pandemic prevention, recovery,
and response. The Network generated a range of
innovative, frugal, and scalable solutions and helped
change how we do development by learning fast and
tapping into new data sources such as geospatial,
social media, and citizen data.

Our work included a diverse range of exploratory
learning activities, from helping to roll out robots in
COVID-19 treatment centers in Rwanda to supporting a
“3D Community” in Tanzania to design, produce and
distribute personal protective equipment to health
workers. By introducing innovation methods such as
participatory design, futures analysis, and prototyping,
the UNDP Accelerator Labs are working with partners
to help create understanding of complex challenges.
