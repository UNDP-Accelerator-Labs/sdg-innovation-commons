Description  Tolbi provides real-time information for effective decision making on irrigation, disease management and yield forecasting to agricultural stakeholders especially small scale producers for a Climate-Smart Agriculture. e-Tolbi resides in the mash-up of global data (satellite images, research work, plant data sheets, diseases) with data related to the smallholder (credit history, property title, mobile money subscriber service, etc.) and data related to the farm (soil data, location, geography, history, etc.) to deliver highly accurate information, predictions and better decision-making for all stakeholders in the agricultural value chain. The data is collected by satellite, drones, from agricultural cooperatives, national agricultural agencies and then centralized through a platform to deliver real-time and reliable information to small farmers in local languages on IVR/SMS voice. This allows agricultural advisors and investors to be able to remotely monitor small farmers in real time through a web-based SAAS platform for accurate alerts and updates based on the data provided. Through the e-Tolbi marketplace, agregator companies, traders and supermarkets will be able to make pre-orders through yield forecasts  based on machine learning algorithms and enable smallholders and their partners to sell at good prices and ensure early marketing. video link : https://youtu.be/W3oviAR0BVU

Challenges Small-scale farmers lose 60-80% of their irrigation water every day due to lack of water control. Late detection of diseases results in an estimated 30% loss of agricultural yield for small farmers. Microfinance institutes lack reliable information and data to set up financial insurance policies to allow small farmers to benefit from financing. They negatively impact the ability of small-scale farmers to innovate in production due to lack of means and to obtain optimal yields due to losses and poor water management.

Insights Tolbi aims to enable small-scale producers to access different services such as production-related services (from the pre-harvest phase to the post-harvest phase to assist and advise them on best practices to combat diseases that can hinder production), finance-related services with detailed field data that can help credit companies to build a reliable credit profile and deliver loans to smallholder farmers more easily, trade and market-related services by facilitating linkages with stakeholders and access to information on best prices, and services related to subscriptions to the cooperative (member management with CRM, distributed communications. .). e-Tobli&#39;s services will enable small farmers to take advantage of technological innovations (drone, artificial intelligence, IoT, satellite) with adapted IVR interfaces in local languages and voice SMS for women and illiterate youth and a mobile application for those who are better equipped and also considerably increase their income with accurate information on the agricultural health (disease, weeds), exact needs for water and fertilization as well as forecasts of harvest periods to aid production-related planning.
