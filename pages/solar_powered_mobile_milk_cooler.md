Farmers in Kenya's West Pokot County struggled to sell their milk as it often got spoilt during transportation. The solution developed by an informatics graduate was a solar powered milk cooler designed to fit onto donkeys and motorcycles. The invention uses aluminium tanks as a cooling system which are connected to a solar panel. It also has a milk PH test kit, an automatic weighing scale and a customized dairy co-operative management application which links the machine and the cooperative society. The machine allows a farmer to keep milk for maximum of three days without going bad. The app automatically collects milk quality and quantity data and relays it to the cooperative's payroll after computing the monthly total collections and relays the same information to the farmer through SMS.
