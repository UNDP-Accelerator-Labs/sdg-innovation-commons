> Title of the innovation

Home made light bulbs. Magnetic and electric based moving machinery. Generation of electric energy from sound energy.

> Brief description of the innovation

'-Home made bulbs from graphite(carbon) but can be improved with perfect selection of the filament material. Avoiding importation of foreign bulbs.
-Instead of fuel usage, introducing machinery derived by magnetic attraction and/or electric energy. Saving fuel for other utilities.
-If given the right scientific equipment to work with, discovering the generation of electricity from sound energy.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

LIGHT BULBS: with the pondered selection of the filament material,I can create light bulbs with high efficiency in energy saving and durability. With this,we won't be needing imported bulbs but can be exported instead, bringing income to the country.
ELECTRICITY FROM SOUND: Having the right scientific apparatus and equipment,I can work on generation of electricity from sound. If this is made possible,it next great source of electricity.
MAGNETIC AND ELECTRIC MACHINERY: Moving machinery such as trains, mine machines can be upgraded to moving by magnetic attraction and electricity instead of fuel.

> Technical Feasibility

Making prototypes would be much easier if I can have the right scientific equipment and a little bit of some time, which I don't because I'm in a rush due to the deadline for submission of these innovations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I also have other ideas of other innovations but let me just anticipate the impact of the mentioned innovations to society. 

Light bulbs would contribute to the lighting up of more rural areas and of course urban areas at large. But more importantly,if made quite excellent and efficient,not only will they benefit our country physically but they can also bring about foreign exchange through exportation.

Magnetic and electric based moving machinery may sound fictional but with the right modifications update to the moving machines, it's a reality. Fuel would largely be conserved for others purposes.

Generation of electricity from sound is a discovery that would be great contribution to the energy sector and the country at large. If efficiently handled with the right scientific equipment,I can work on this break through.

These breakthroughs mentioned and the others I have that I haven't mentioned aren't a scientific fiction. They're as real as they come and sound. Work is just needed by the right and capable minds.
