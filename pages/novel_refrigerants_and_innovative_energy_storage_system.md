> Description of the solution

An innovative refrigeration system incoporating phase change material (PCM) is proposed to mantain refrigerated trucks at a desired thermal condition. The advantage of using PCM to mantain low temperatures is that a conventional refrigeration system does not have to be located on-board the vehicle. In addition, the system consumes less energy and produces much lower local greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
