> Brief description of the innovation

A mobile phone-controlled set of switches that allows for the switching on and off of selected home appliances. This control is achieved wirelessly via Bluetooth or wifi.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The expected way of income generations is via sales, installation, and after-sale support (hardware and software upgrades). Some of the improvements that this innovation brings include but are not limited to improving the livelihood of people who depend on assisted living. These include people who are advanced in age and differently-abled people who still can use a mobile phone but are not able to perform tasks like switching on and off lights in their homes or draw curtains. The Smart DB gives them some level of control of their home.
Secondly is in power consumption management. Smart DB coupled with the right algorithm can help people set when the Gyser comes on, what time the security lights turn on/off, the convenience of managing the lighting in the home from a central location.
If I win the prize money I would like to set up a small electronics lab where I can develop more innovations.

> Technical Feasibility

The design takes advantage of the vast availability of smart phone nowadays. An app on the phone controls a set of relays via a bluetooth connections. 
The controller hardware is powered by the mains line that connect to the controlling relays. Each relay controls a specific attached device, this the prototype lights of the house were connected.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The expected improvement in the lives of others are:
1. Convenience: The need to go round the house to switch off lights before going to bed is taken away and same for the morning. Calling for someone to switch on the TV or light where you are because you are unable due to a physical challenge  becomes unneccesary.
2. Power managemen: Set on and off time for different appliances especially those that consume a lot of powerlike water heater.
3. Automation: With the right software algorithm, fine tune power usage for avert large peak power in renewable energy sources .i.e solar.
