> Title of the innovation

RISE UP FOR CHANGE INTITIAVE

> Brief description of the innovation

RISE UP FOR CHANGE - is an initiative that supports youths both boys and girls through skills i.e bricklaying, carpentry and joinery, metal fabrication, general agriculture and entrepreneurship for them to become more productive and better citizens. It also supports vulnerable children with school materials, school fees, food and health care. Unfortunately the attached pictures above is the building that we used to use for service delivery but it was burnt by the mob of people during the time of gassing. We started the renovations and currently stopped due to financial constraints.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The institution generates income through small amount of tuition fees paid by learner's and through the selling of garden and farm produce. Market is in place, marketeers are always our customers and the surrounding community. The value addition is that once these youths are trained will able to start up their own businesses, create jobs and be food secure. Once these youths are engaged in this program; crimes, theft will be reduced, early marriages and unwanted pregnancies among girls will be also reduced.

> Technical Feasibility

RISE UP FOR CHANGE INTITIAVE is designed in such a way that it provides life skills and entrepreneurship to the youths more especially girls. The proposed is that we want to expand this institution from the capacity of 20 participants to 100 plus participants. More youths are completing their secondary education and failing to enroll for higher education due to high payment of school fees. And those who are managing to enroll and do courses like teaching are failing to find jobs because of jobs crisis. Hence encouraging youths to go into skills and entrepreneurship as this help them create jobs and bring about sustainability among themselves.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will help youths create employment for themselves. Market is available. More youths are willing to enroll for this courses.
