Companies can have an impactful role in helping employees in escaping gender violence as Maga Lu, a large retail company in Brazil, has done since 2017. The solution includes a hotline, that beyond only redirect to social services, also has psychologists, monitors of cases, and resources to offer relocation and a support network through the process of recovering.



Beyond the tools, the innovation here is the focus, reconsidering work as an important network for every person that can be more than just a transactional salary-task exchange.


So far more than 700 have been supported to escape abusive relationships  legally, financially, and emotionally and the company has paid to relocate over 100 of these women.


The level of engagement is unusual for a company, especially when many see it as a too complex matter, but helps support the idea that gender violence is NOT a problem of women, but of society as a whole where we all have a responsibility and a role to play.
