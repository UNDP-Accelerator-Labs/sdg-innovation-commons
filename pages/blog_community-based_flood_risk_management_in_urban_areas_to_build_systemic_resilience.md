Community-Based Flood Risk Management in Urban Areas to Build Systemic Resilience
FEBRUARY 14, 2022
Most existing disaster mitigation indicators and targets such as risk mapping, preventive infrastructure protection, and early warning systems, are focused on infrastructure resilience. The more unpredictable nature of disasters, on the other hand, requires a systemic approach, involving social and cultural capital as well as local solutions. UNDP’s Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with the Directorate of Water Resources and Irrigation - Ministry of National Development Planning (DIPI BAPPENAS), civil society organization, academic institution, and impacted communities, conducted a public survey and ethnographic study in several cities to better understand the aspirations, needs, behaviors, and solutions in low-income urban communities regarding flood infrastructure. A bottom-up and inclusive disaster risk management plan, based on emerging insights and relevant factors, has the potential to strengthen resilience by closing the gap between policymakers and communities.
