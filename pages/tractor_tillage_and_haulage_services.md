> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

That innovation with provide small scale farmers with access to affordable and efficient tillage services that will ensure timely land preparation and planting. Timely implementation of these farm operations will help mitigate climate related stocks such as droughts and prolonged dry spells. Furthermore, the innovation will provide haulage services of inputs and outputs to the market. Combined, the service would contribute to improving crop production and productivity thereby enhancing the food security and income standing of many small-scale farmers in Mulobezi District

> Technical Feasibility

The project will be located in Mulobezi District of Western province where Agriculture is the main livelihood.  Several small scale farmers depend on hand hoes for tillage and a few privileged ones have access to Animal Draft Power (ADP) to undertakethe operation. That the climate is changing as evidenced by frequent episodes of drought and prolonged dry spells and subsequent shortened growing season, affecting crop production. Thus, the innovation seeks to promote conservation agriculture  and improve access to mechanised tillage services I.e. ripping and ploughing ensuring timely land preparation there by inducing early planting. Haulage services will also be provided in order to improve farmers access to the input and output market.inturn this will enhance food security and farm income in Mulobezi District through improved efficiency, crop production and productivity.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will target 600 small scale and atleast 3000Ha of farmland will be tilled per year. The business will target 20 farmer cooperatives and 2 aggregators for transportation of inputs and produce to-and-from the market.
