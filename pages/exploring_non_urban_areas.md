## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring Non-Urban Areas
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that people in non-urban areas have limited access to the market, reliant on a central market, and/or are not self-sufficient. With this, it is harder to live a comfortable, stable life with dignity and agency over their present and future, and have the ability to achieve this without leaving their town.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Jordan’s economy is very centralized and areas outside of urban centers are marginalized. Therefore there is a lot of disparity in terms of income, livelihoods, and overall wellbeing. Jordan also is poor in natural resources and moving towards a service based economy focused in urban centers.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The following link lead to the documents of the research interviews held in the 3 locations in Jordan, Shouneh, Theeban and Northern Badiya, and Madaba. The screenshot is a group of the highlights of the interviews. Later on, and with the help of the pillars team members, these notes were divided into groups per topics.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is working on exploring the challenge as a system and has the freedom to look at the idea of economic empowerment and livelihood through a new lens, and to work in areas that are not necessarily related to a specific scope of work. There is also a lack of efforts in creating market driven solution, as most of the current intervention lack demand. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Accelerator Lab Jordan is tackling livelihood in non-urban areas, analyzing the system, and testing what could provide the community members with a comfortable, stable life with dignity and agency, and have the ability to achieve this without leaving their town.
## Challenge classification

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The UNDP Pillars are providing their insights on the challenge. Together, we are exploring potential entry points to collaborate together. We are still exploring the area of work, thus, new partners besides the UNDP will likely emerge.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What might we test that would allow community members to live a comfortable, stable life with dignity and agency over their present and future, and have the ability to achieve this without leaving their town?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Given the complex nature of the livelihoods challenge we do require a granular understanding of the marginalized community. The tools above would allow us to capture the different perspectives on the daily lives of the community.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

What’s often missing from existing data on this topic is stories and personal experiences of the challenges that marginalized communities face. There is often a lot of quantitative data but not much qualitative data that provides a more in-depth understanding of the situation. The value of the more qualitative research that the AccLab brings is that it can lead to a better identification of the systemic issues and in turn potentially a more impactful interventions.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

CBOs, NGOs and development agencies interested in tackling decentralization of markets and resources.  We will get a better idea of who can join us when we clearly define the challenge.
