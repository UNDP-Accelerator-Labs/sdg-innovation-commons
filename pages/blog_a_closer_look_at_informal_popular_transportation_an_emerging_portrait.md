Executive Summary

Overview

It is possible informal transportation moves more people in
the world than all formal transportation modes combined
and probably employs hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of people across the globe. Yet we know very
little about these systems. We find some information in
academic papers and institutional reports. But much of
the insight remains with the people who use and work in
informal transportation–people who may not share their
experiences on mainstream platforms.

Building on its priority for Research & Development (R&D) on
informality, the Global Network for Popular Transportation
(GNPT)1 and the United Nations Development Programme’s
(UNDP) Accelerator Lab Network started this research to
learn more about informal transportation, but also to learn
about how we think about, process and address it.

Here, we share the results of a blended learning journey, one
in which we combine various sources. The explicit knowledge
gives us referenced, methodical findings within established
frameworks. The interviews with industry experts update
our knowledge of rapidly changing innovations. The tacit
knowledge from the UNDP Accelerator Labs provides us with
the everyday lived experience, the intuition and the pulse of
the situation. Together, the blended knowledge gives us a
more complete picture. In the report, we share some key
messages identified through the learning process.

The work does not end here. GNPT will continue to build
this dialogue with UNDP and its other partners. The report
offers next steps and questions to move the work forward
which we hope will be of interest to practitioners, advocates,
and governments alike.

At the time we began this research, we operated under the conceptual
framework of ‘Informal Transportation,’ and the organization was known
as the Global Partnership for Informal Transportation. For clarity and
to honor the learning questions, we continued using the term informal
transportation in this report. However, since 2023, we have officially
changed our name because we believe ‘Popular Transportation’ is a better
way to refer to this type of transportation. Learn why

Key Messages

In the Deep Dive section of this report, we review the literature, interviews with
industry experts, and practice-based conversations with the Accelerator Labs.
Here are some of the main messages we gleaned from this blended knowledge:

1. As a less visible sector, advancing our knowledge about informal transportation requires new
ways to harness learning. Harnessing experiential knowledge plays a crucial role. Accelerator
Labs are a key source of experiential knowledge and on-the-ground enablers connecting key
players. But organizations usually lack this type of access yet have the ability to scale. With the
Accelerator Labs’ built capacity, UNDP can achieve both.

2. Informal modes are not just a backup, but often the primary and sometimes the only means
of transportation, valued for their responsiveness, flexibility and versatility, including cargo
transport. They often stimulate innovation and are sometimes the only public transport option.
Although we do not have exact figures, the blended knowledge suggests that informality in
transport exists everywhere there is an unmet need. And the scale of unmet need is huge. The
significance of informality extends to other sectors like food and waste collection, where such
businesses offer essential services to those otherwise left unserved.

3. Despite calling this kind of transport informal, these systems function within an organized
ecosystem of actors whose operations are powered by small and medium-sized businesses.
These systems challenge the pervasive western approach to how transport should be organized
and can bring a lot of learning on how we should understand, analyze and build our transport
systems.

4. Drivers want to find passengers and passengers want a convenient, safe, affordable service.
Digital technologies have a role to play in addressing these concerns, but while it is a noticeable
trend, our work on the ground shows it is a trend that is not a priority, particularly for low-tech,
cash-based systems.

5. Negative environmental impacts and social issues problematize the narrative around informal
transportation. But, considering its size and organization, informal systems should be viewed
as a means to create sustainable impact.

6. Informal mobility and work provide better access to opportunities for many, but still, people
are left behind. Marginalized groups, such as women, migrants, trans or non-binary people,
still face issues like passenger safety and workplace discrimination.

7. Informality and formality are not fixed nor binary endpoints. Most services fluctuate within a

hybrid state and there are many pathways between formality and informality.

8. We should change the way we think about informality in the transport sector: flip the script to
consider it as an opportunity to address unmet mobility needs with dynamism and creativity.
We should explore hybrid models where formalization is not the only way forward and support
policy makers to realize the potential of the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem in
developing countries.

Blending Knowledge

Building on UNDP’s R&D priority: informality

As a learning network, the UNDP Accelerator Labs have been testing a
model to transform centrally driven knowledge management and R&D
into a distributed model that acknowledges diversity and continuous
change across multiple local contexts.

The Network of 91 UNDP Accelerator Labs are sharing actionable learning
on a daily basis. They benefit from each other in real-time, creating powerful
collective learning effects. This creates the opportunity to surface ideas
that are on the horizon but not yet part of mainstream development and
allows for new approaches to unfold across many different contexts in a
low-risk way.

During the learning journey of the Accelerator Labs, a common learning
theme and focus throughout the Network has been informality and
the informal sector. One of the conclusions is the need for a better
understanding of what constitutes informality and innovation in the usual
policy prescription (formalize the informal.) The Accelerator Lab Network
has experimented with ways to capture existing patterns within the
Network and blend experience with research to produce new knowledge
about emergent development problems and opportunity spaces. The
UNDP Accelerator Lab Network is seeking to better understand how
different informal systems work, what hybrid models look like,
and relative risks and benefits to a strategy that commonly puts
formalization at the core. The Accelerator Labs developed learning
questions based on a collective understanding of what unknown
territory is.

To test out this prototype, the UNDP Accelerator Labs have partnered
with the Global Network For Popular Transportation to build out learning,
policy and practice in the area of informal transportation.

Informal transportation—ojeks, tuktuks, jeepneys, matatus, colectivos,
etc.— are a core part of urban mobility systems in the rapidly growing
metropolitan regions of the Global South. These regionwide, privately
provided transport modes emerge to meet the demand for cheap,
flexible mobility. They move millions, employ hundreds of thousands, and
support the sizable informal sector in urban economies. Despite this near
ubiquity, informal transportation is often seen as a local problem.

The sector suffers from haphazard, discriminatory policies and regulations
and is often overlooked in urban and transportation planning. Ignoring
the potential of these services negatively impacts millions of users,
many of them from the most vulnerable groups in society. An emerging
community of practice within the transportation sector is focusing on
informal transportation, however, these efforts largely focus on how to
formalize informal systems.

From the moment we name it, informal transportation is defined and
understood from the viewpoint of what it is not (not formal), rather than
what it actually is. Therefore, in this exercise, we draw from tacit and
explicit knowledge sources to expand commonly understood framings
on informal transportation.

This research is guided by prompts developed as part of UNDP’s network
learning prototype. These prompts aim to gather systemic insights on:
• How informal transport operators and workers perceive themselves;
• How formalization efforts from authorities might incentivize or

affect these actors;

• What digital technologies mean to the sector;
• The informal transport sector’s link to environment and

sustainability;

• How informal transport impacts equal opportunities; and
• Experiences when it comes to integrating these types of informal

services to transportation systems and planning.

These prompts are explored in the six chapters of the Deep Dive Section.

Literature reviews can’t keep up with the pace of
change

Widely available, documented sources of knowledge on
informal
transportation exist largely within academia and institutions. Indeed
our first pass at answering the questions on informality was to review
trenchant literature on the subject. While we were only able to include a
short list of publications, we find that institutions and academia provide a
limited perspective on this vast, diverse subject.

Each reference published through an academic journal or institution has
its own process, framework, and timeline. Yet, communities and cities
change rapidly. The way people move in them does, too. There are global
commonalities among informal transportation systems, but a wide
spectrum of contexts. The field warrants an approach in which recurring,
bottom-up feedback can rise to mainstream access.

Looking beyond the literature

Initially, we spoke to several industry experts to supplement the literature
review. From November to December 2021, we interviewed three current
experts, along with two representatives of so-called “super-apps” — a
new generation of integrated mobility, banking and commerce apps
blurring the line between “formal” and “informal.” This opened new lines
of questioning, which are summarized in our literature review report.

We then partnered with UNDP Accelerator Labs to enrich our
understanding of informal transportation. Through a series of loosely
structured conversations, called Learning Circles, we learned from the
personal experiences and field research of UNDP Accelerator Lab teams
in Bolivia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, North Macedonia, and
Togo.

The Accelerator Labs interview people on the ground, talk to their contacts
in other organizations, and pull stories from local outlets. They also bring
their own experiential knowledge to the table. Using these combined
sources, the Labs are able to tell us about user and worker experiences
and how different systems work.

Speaking directly to industry experts, we are able to draw out knowledge
that may otherwise remain isolated to a certain context or circle. The Ola
Mobility Institute publishes much of its research, but speaking directly
with Aishwarya Raman, Director and Head of Research at Ola Mobility
Institute helped us quickly narrow-in on relevant findings. Three Wheels

United, a global tech-enhanced financier for light electric vehicles in emerging markets, however,
does not have the reflection and codification capability to regularly share its valuable lessons. The
interview with Three Wheels United’s founder, Cedrik Tandong therefore yielded many insightful
contributions to this report, such as lessons on microfinancing and the benefits of online driver
communities.

We are also able to quickly distill collective insights from broad questions. For example, even though
each Accelerator Lab is working in different contexts, we found commonalities and trends regarding
workers’ and users’ needs regarding transport access, safety, affordability, governance and legality.

In other instances, the Labs helped counterbalance our focus. On the topic of digitalization, when
speaking to the representatives from super-app companies, the perspective is that the field is changing
so quickly that some of the technology models may not even be around by the time institutions
are able to study and understand the evolving dynamics. In fact, a large part of our preliminary
report, “Applying Learning Questions on Informal Economies to Informal Transportation,” focused
on the many opportunities and challenges posed by these rapid changes. However, based on the
reflection sessions - which we call Learning Circles - the Accelerator Labs take a much different
view by questioning whether digital technology is a critical focal point, given the pain points the
technologies are capable of addressing in low-tech environments.

We note a clear advantage to having the Labs on the ground with the tools and networks in place
to quickly gather information. In a few weeks, the Accelerator Labs contributed to the expansion
of the ongoing Glossary on Informal Transportation. The Labs photographed different modes and
interviewed drivers, operators and passengers in the categories required. While the Matutu buses
are widely researched and photographed, the Akro ferry in Togo or the pick-up trucks in Guatemala
are much less known or visible to the outside world. The Glossary entries help make informal
transport more visible. And more examples illustrate the scale and diversity of these systems.

The knowledge is not only more diverse but is also given in real time. In Lebanon, where the
governance situation may differ from one day to the next, understanding what is happening on
the ground requires access to a live feedback loop, which the UNDP Lebanon Accelerator Lab can
provide.

In The Deep Dive we share the blended learnings across the six key Learning Questions. Each
section starts by summarizing information found in the literature review and insights from key
industry experts. We then share the experiential insights from the participating Labs. Each section
ends with key takeaways from this blended knowledge.

Scanning the Field

An Imperfect Definition

There is no universally accepted term for what we call informal transport.
Throughout the literature we find numerous terms and slightly different ways
of defining them.
For example, the authors of Informal and Semiformal Services in Latin America:
An Overview of Public Transportation Reforms2 recognize that “adopting a strict
definition of informal transportation is difficult and problematic” because some
services may exist outside of the confined definition.

Despite definitional ambiguities, who defines the system matters. While the
term paratransit may emphasize a market need for last mile connectivity,
semi-formal transit may focus on the regulatory mix of operational strategies.
Meanwhile - and perhaps most importantly - we do not have a sense of how
the people who work in and use these systems define them, other than by their
local name.

“Without trying to impose a strict definition we refer to all
operations with some measure of informality as informal
transit.”3

For the purposes of this research, we are deferring to the framing presented
in From Mobility to Access for All: Urban Transportation Choices in the Global
South: “Without trying to impose a strict definition we refer to all operations
with some measure of informality as informal transit.”4

Informal

Paratransit, Artisanal transport, traditional transport,

Popular Transit, Entrepreneurial Transit,

neighborhood mobility, indigenous transport, makeshift mobility...

Semi-formal Transport, Vernacular Mobility...

The terms themselves are insightful. Referring to entrepreneurial creativity that provides a
transport service as “informal”, “paratransit” or “unregulated”, positions these systems in contrast
to something else - formal, transit, regulated. Other recent and infrequent ways to refer to these
forms of transport - “popular”, “entrepreneurial”, “neighborhood”, “indigenous”, attempt to affirm
what it is.

An Invisible Norm

Clearly, there is a lack of data on the prevalence of these systems. This should not be surprising
as city level and country level agencies do not collect information for modes that they may not
recognize as legitimate businesses or forms of transport.

Where we do find available city and
country level figures, we see that
informal modes are a critical part of
the public transportation offering.

Informal transportation is an affordable mobility option for the 80% of urban
dwellers in Africa who cannot afford a car.5

Informal or paratransit modes are particularly important in African and some Latin
American cities, where they carry up to 95 % of all public transport trips.6

• 20% of residents in Latin American cities lack access to formal transport within a 10-
walk from their homes; 15% of residents in informal settlements lack any access at
all.7

The Informal Transport Worker

01 In Plain Sight: Seeing Informality

In the literature we find three main types of informal transport workers: 1) rural to urban migrants,
renting vehicles; 2) urban, owning vehicles; and 3) the platform worker.

The first are often rural-to-urban migrants who take up driving due to its relatively low barriers to
entry, lack of other opportunities, and relatively high wages. In Uganda, for example, boda boda
drivers frequently out-earn teachers, police, and other civil servants. Workers typically rent their
vehicles rather than owning them.

The second type of informal transport workers tend to be rooted in a more urban context and are
more likely to invest their savings in owning a two or three-wheeled vehicle, seeing it as a productive
asset. They may also accrue other assets and businesses — such as a shop or plot of land for farming
— and exit driving after several years.

Both urban and rural to urban transport groups tend to organize through informal driver networks
and associations designed to limit competition or fix prices. In Uganda, for instance, boda bodas
are frequently organized into stages with their own identities, defined territories and pricing, and
whose members pay dues and elect their own leaders.9

A third type of worker has emerged with the advent of platform super-apps such as Gojek, Grab,
and Ola. Whereas the platforms began by aggregating existing vehicles and drivers, they are now
recruiting their own drivers. In Jakarta, for example, Gojek is recruiting from a new pool of un- and
under-employed workers drawn from other sectors under economic pressure, such as manufacturing.
They drive primarily for the platforms — which represent a form of “semi-formalization” explored
later in the report — while only dabbling in informal work outside them.

An Income and a Ride

When discussing the perceptions and motivations of people who use or operate within the informal
transportation system, most explicit material focuses on the importance of the jobs and the mobility
it provides in the absence of better alternatives.

The literature suggests that drivers can earn a basic income, often above minimum wage. It
provides a readily available form of livelihood with minimal entry requirements and immediate,
daily earnings. Operators need minimal capital investment or administrative staff to make a profit,
making this sector an attractive livelihood option for many people. In Uganda, for example, the
boda - boda sector was the second largest employer in the country.10

While the informal transport industry contributes to poverty alleviation, the exploitative and insecure
nature of the work is highlighted. For example, a study reviewed by the authors of The Future of

01 In Plain Sight: Seeing Informality

Paratransit and Shared Mobility: Mapping Report, found that danfo drivers in Africa work an average
of 20 hours a day despite the fact that 22% are partially blind and 99% suffer from hypertension.11
Workers face other threats as well. In the Enciclopedia del Transporte Informal en América Central
drivers reported threats and attacks (in cases of non-compliance) related to a “war tax”, a kind of toll
that drug traffickers and gangs impose on those who transit through their territories.12

From the passenger perspective, the literature finds the services to be reliable and demand
responsive. This may be due to poor access or connectivity to public transport, issues of affordability,
or lack of other mobility options. For instance, car-centric urban development excludes the 80% of
urban dwellers in Africa who cannot afford to buy a car.13

The Future of Paratransit and Shared Mobility: Mapping Report further breaks down user motivations
by income group. It finds that upper-middle income users list waiting times and distance as the
main benefits while affordability is the main benefit for low-income users.

In the Enciclopedia del Transporte Informal en América Central, respondents give low ratings on
safety and comfortability, but high ratings on travel speed and ease of use. In the Latin America
context, some informal systems received higher satisfaction rates than BRT and Metro systems.14

In other instances, the informal option is the only option. One passenger from Hawassa, Ethiopia
sums it up: “If the Bajaj is lost, then everything is lost. Without the Bajaj, we cannot move and there
is no city.”15

Diversifying the Context

Everywhere for Everything

In this project, we asked the Labs to submit specific information about informal
modes where they live. These were used as new entries to the Glossary on Informal
Transportation, which was previously launched with entries from Central America.

The Glossary of Informal Transportation showcases what transport modes are
used to provide informal and semi-formal transport services in different cities,
how they look, popular names given to them, and key insights on how they
operate and how people use them, allowing us to further understand context-
specific similarities and differences of these types of services around the world.

All countries were able to identify at least one mode. Initially, the UNDP North
Macedonia Accelerator Lab was not aware of any informal system. However, upon
further investigation, they found a case in which private cars, properly registered
according to the laws, were offering informal, for-hire services for airport
trips or organized carpooling. This network services neighborhoods primarily
consisting of Roma communities to central locations in the city of Skopje and
other destinations.

While much of the conversation focused on informality in urban transport,
experience from the Labs emphasizes the importance of peri-urban to urban
connectivity and provision of services in rural areas. For instance, in Bolivia, the
minibuses serving inter-urban routes are appropriately named ‘surubíes’.

UNDP Accelerator Labs in Togo, Kenya and Guatemala find that informal services
also provide users the option to transport goods and provide other services,
such as the distribution of small freight. Paola Constantino, Head of Solutions
Mapping, UNDP Guatemala Accelerator Lab observes that moto - taxi vehicles
are often used to deliver food and goods to customers and that vehicles mainly
used to carry cargo, such as pick-ups, also provide mobility service to people in
rural areas.16

A Social Network

01 In Plain Sight: Seeing Informality

Based on their research, the Labs find additional actors and observe different types of relationships
among actors.

In Bolivia, it is common for entire families to be part of the minibus system. The husband drives, the
wife ‘barks’ - a term for attracting customers - for passengers, and the children sometimes collect
fares. The family name is often displayed on a sticker in the vehicles’ windows. Patricia Choque, Head
of Experimentation, UNDP Bolivia Accelerator Lab, notes that drivers characterize their operation as
a family business 17.

We also hear from the Accelerator Labs about the strong role NGOs, cooperatives and other types
of associations play in the network. In Kenya for example, cooperatives are a prevalent form of
organization with 2.5 million of them active across the country.18 Victor Awuor, Head of Solutions
Mapping, UNDP Kenya Accelerator Lab, shares that when there’s a problem with the government, it
is often a cooperative or an NGO that steps in to mediate between parties.

In Bolivia, most drivers and operators are organized via associations, which local governments have
started to require to register and comply with certain operational and legal requirements. However,
it is the associations, rather than the government, who organize drivers and establish routes. This
gives them notable political influence. “They [the transport associations] are powerful politically.
Because when they want to stop the city, they can,” says Patricia.19

Businesses that Want to Thrive

Importantly, we heard from the Accelerators Labs that on the topic of formalization, drivers and
operators do not identify as “informal”, but rather as entrepreneurs hoping to gain stability in some
aspect of their business.

The business models vary widely. One example is the range of ownership models.
Lazar Pop Ivanov, Head of Experimentation, UNDP North Macedonia Accelerator Lab shares that
private vehicle owners use their legally registered vehicle to directly provide an informal service.
“The vehicles are regularly registered. It is just the service that is informal,” he says.20

In Togo, we learn that most drivers are renting their vehicles from a single vehicle owner, however,
there are emerging innovative “work and pay” models that allow for drivers to make daily payments
in order to finally buy their vehicles. Associations, fleets, and other consolidated, organized entities
are rare in Togo, if they exist at all, according to Yawo Agnigbankou, Head of Experimentation, UNDP
Togo Accelerator Lab.21 In contrast, research from Kenya shows that middle income earners are
buying motorbikes and hiring drivers as a form of investment.22

01 In Plain Sight: Seeing Informality

The Labs reiterate the importance of the movement of people, goods and services. But they also
reiterate the importance of the micro-economy around the transit stations which consist of various
vendors. In Guatemala, in addition to stores, phone booths are also commonly found near informal
stations.23

A Blurry Line

Many of these factors contribute to the blurred line between informality and formality. Legally
registered vehicles are used as unauthorized public transport. Collective organizing through
a cooperative may make work feel less informal and more professional, as would facilitating
negotiations with authorities and regulators. Identifying as an entrepreneur in a wide-reaching
local economy may normalize the concept of informality.

The Labs observe that the ad hoc governance structure surrounding these systems may further
contribute to an unclear understanding of when something transitions from informal to formal.
Victor notes that in Kenya, local police and local administration have a say in terms of where the
stops or stations are situated. However, these stations are built by a mix of the private sector and
sometimes the initiative of the drivers themselves. “In the absence of support from the government
or private sector actors, the riders (drivers?) take their own initiative and contribute to [build] the
stops,” he shares.24

In Bolivia, the municipal authority regulates prices but is unable to enforce them. Diego Suárez,
Head of Solutions Mapping, UNDP Bolivia Accelerator Lab says that as a result, drivers end up
determining their own prices, often allowing competition to set the standard.25

01 In Plain Sight: Seeing Informality

A Mainstream Alternative

It is widely accepted that informal transport exists because of a lack of alternative options, but the
opposite may also be true; passengers are using informal modes despite alternatives. Igor Izotov,
Head of Exploration, UNDP North Macedonia Accelerator Lab says their research found that some
families use informal transport services for vacation, not only to go to the airport, but also for the
whole trip, including cross border trips.26

In many contexts where the Labs work, the poor pedestrian environment, unfavorable environmental
conditions, or fragmented public transport requiring multiple transfers to reach a destination,
attract passengers to the door-to-door service provided by informal modes.

Paola shares that in Guatemala, the Tuk-Tuks are uniquely able to adapt to the topography and
configuration of the narrow street networks, which is one of the reasons people prefer this kind of
service. “Formal transportation doesn’t even think they have to cover these areas,” she says.27

This is echoed by Yawo, who says that in Togo, “many like using motorbikes because of the flexibility.
They can drive you to your precise location.”28

Passengers also rely on informal transportation because of their low price that makes these services
available to most people. For example, according to field research done by the UNDP Lebanon
Accelerator Lab, students are one of the main users driven by the low price of informal systems.

01 In Plain Sight: Seeing Informality

Shifting the Narrative

Although we do not have exact figures, the blended knowledge suggests
that informality in transport exists everywhere there is an unmet need. And
the scale of unmet need is huge. We know that informal transport is not a
last resort to be suffered nor is it a perfect solution to be wholly accepted at
face value. What we see from the literature and the Accelerator Labs is that
informality in transport gives us deeper insight to how people need to and
want to move on a daily basis given the reality of their context.

The blended knowledge suggests that informal transportation is more than
a service to move people and goods; it is an economic ecosystem. Beyond
the transport service itself, the ecosystem includes the vendors from repair
shops to food stalls that depend on and support the passengers, workers,
and communities where the systems operate.

We see that the system is often made up of small and medium-sized business
enterprises with strong entrepreneurial energy. These entrepreneurs have
the agency to make decisions on a daily basis about what is good for their
business and their customers.

Given these insights, how might we assign more value to the work and
services these systems provide?

Operation Formalize

What we see in the literature is a commonly accepted goal: most local authorities
seek to formalize informal transport systems for the purpose of achieving
better management control and enforcement of these services. However,
there is a need to better understand whether these types of efforts actually
incentivise informal transport operators to shift their business models, or how
these efforts are affecting or impacting operators, drivers and users.

At one extreme, we find some governments fully ban informal systems. They
may seek to wipe them out or to transition the workers to a different, formal
mode, most commonly a bus system. At the other end of the spectrum we find
bottom-up solutions emerging from drivers, operators, and their organizations.
In between, we see a variety of semi-formal approaches.

From the Top Down

02 In Flux: The Spectrum of Formalization

In the literature we find examples of top-down initiatives enacted by governments in response to
service inefficiencies, road safety and personal safety issues, labor conditions, or environmental
concerns.

One approach seeks to integrate and upgrade informal services to a fixed-route public transport
system centrally managed by a government agency. In this case we see last mile solutions or
fare integration to create an organized network of different services. Cities like Bangkok where
songtaews, Tuk-Tuks, and motorcycle taxis bring passengers to the MRT and Skytrain aim to drive
passengers to new stations and routes.

The other top-down approach we find uses incremental upgrades to achieve semi-formal
compromises. Examples of gradual fleet renewal programs coupled with funding and institutional
support are found in Alwar, India, Kathmandu, Nepal, and Dakar, Senegal. There are also cases in
which priority lanes are allocated to informal modes or route concessions are distributed among
informal operators. In other examples, we find that informal modes are allowed to operate in
restricted areas, often outside of a main thoroughfare. In Guatemala, for instance, the Tuk-Tuks are
only allowed on main roads but can service alternative routes that connect to the formal system. In
Bolivia, the minibuses are allowed to operate but are restricted from intercity routes.

The incremental approach, to some degree, acknowledges the technical, political, and financial
constraints faced by local or national transport authorities.

Less-discussed drivers of formalization, such as post-colonial influences on modernity, are explored
in a few of the documents. The concepts of “formality as fetish” or “performing the modern city”
show that in many contexts, informality is not associated with or accepted as part of successful
modern development.29

From the Bottom Up

The bottom-up initiatives we find in the literature largely extend from cooperatives and vehicle
owners, operators, or drivers.

As we learned in the first section, those working in the sector often self-identify as entrepreneurs.
Bottom-up reforms are therefore driven by a desire for legality, security, and an ability to grow
business. In Mexico City, for example, informal incumbents were motivated to sell their concession
titles and routes to create a new firm that could bid in city level contracts and even purchase the
new BRT buses. In Nairobi, we find another case in which drivers are able to access services through
savings and credit cooperatives.

02 In Flux: The Spectrum of Formalization

Mixed Results

The literature presents a range of experiences with formalization efforts.

Where formality involves the implementation of rigid routes and service planning, there is a risk that
the flexibility and demand responsiveness favored by users of the informal system will be altered.
This may result in fare increases, longer walks to relocated transit stops, and an increase in the
number of transfers required to reach a destination.

While the general expectation that the formalization process improves employment conditions for
drivers and operators, the results are mixed.30

Some cases show that operators who attempted to enter the formal transport sector were not able
to meet the required financial obligations which excluded them from bidding processes or resulted
in contract cancellations.

Drivers also often face financial obstacles in the informal system. For instance, there may be fierce
competition when an unregulated number of vehicles operate on the same route, driving down
earnings. Individual-owner drivers or operators may be unable to access financing to expand or
improve the service.

Informal workers may also be excluded from labor laws and social protections. And depending on
access to effective organizing structures, they may not have collective bargaining rights. Security,
improved working conditions, and guaranteed livelihood may be motivators to formalize.

Evidence from Johannesburg shows that, with an appropriate labor framework, informal transport
employees who moved to work for a formal company experienced a significant increase in their
annual income.31 Other research shows that upgrading to formal transport work does not necessarily
guarantee a better financial outcome, as little data is available on the before and after benefits
when employment has been formalized.32

In Jakarta, the experiences and incomes of drivers who switched to using ride hailing apps remain
the same, while the app owners “exploit their work as a place of capital extraction.” In addition, the
app’s business model views waiting time as unproductive and aims to eradicate it, which has eroded
drivers’ social networks and traditional local terminals and led to some protests.33

02 In Flux: The Spectrum of Formalization

Resistance to Change

In the literature we find a long list of reasons drivers/operators and passengers resist formalization.
Drivers and operators might resist or show little interest in the formalization process because of
concerns related to loss of autonomy and business flexibility, financial and economic risk, and lack
of trust in government agencies initiating the projects, dependence on government subsidies and
thus decreased coverage, capacity and performance in times of national macroeconomic financial
crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic).34

For passengers, the reasons might include increased fares, long journeys to transport stops, rigid
routes, loss of the ability to operate on the narrow roads and unpaved streets often found in the
peripheral areas of developing cities.35

Often the discourse on formalization overlooks the ability to enforce any such regulations. Willam
Boose notes that in Cartagena, the sector is so large that 69% of mototaxistas ignore government
restrictions.36 In Bolivia, although some municipalities regulate fares, drivers often set their own
rates based on competition.

Enter the Super-Apps

The emergence of the super-app adds another dimension to this discussion.

The experts we interviewed emphasized that the speed and impacts of digitization over the last two-
to-five years cannot be overstated. From the perspective of scholars and NGOs, the rise of super
apps such as Gojek has been so swift as to be almost entirely absent from the academic literature.

Digitalization has introduced a degree of formality to informal transport. By requiring drivers to
submit credentials, wear uniforms, and submit to GPS-based tracking and surveillance, platforms
such as Gojek, Grab, and Ola, etc. have clearly instituted some formalization of the sector, but to
what extent is up for debate. Aishwarya Raman maintains the platforms represent a third category
of workers. From policymakers’ perspective, it’s important to note that while digitization has made
workers more legible to the platforms themselves, they remain opaque to regulators and the
broader mobility ecosystem, as each platform struggles to maintain its competitive advantage.

The trajectory of growth and innovation has also resulted in a reverse outcome. As the platforms’
technological capabilities begin to outstrip those of formal public transportation when it comes
to booking and payment, it is possible the formal mode will be folded into the informal system.
In October 2020, for example, Gojek launched GoTransit for seamless multimodal trip planning
across its own services and Jakarta MRT. Will super apps seek to fold formal transportation into their
platforms?

Efforts

Leaving No One Behind

The UNDP Accelerator Labs attempted to find whether operators, drivers,
or users identify any risks, concerns or potential impacts in the different
formalization efforts taking place in their different countries and cities. The
experiential learning process highlighted a disconnect between formalization
efforts and the realities and needs of informal transport operators and users
of these services.

The main risks and incentives identified in this exercise are:

02 In Flux: The Spectrum of Formalization

Dialogue is Key

The Accelerator Labs find examples of differing incentives between authorities and informal
transport actors. Elias Mouawad, Head of Exploration, UNDP Lebanon Accelerator Lab points out
the lack of incentives that exist for informal transport operators and government regulators.37

Moving the Goalpost

There are many risks associated with formalizing the work, the service, or both. And the blended
knowledge shows there can be a disconnect between what regulators aim to control and what the
workers and users need on the ground.

A paradigm shift is likely needed to improve these systems based on how these systems actually
work. We did not find any interventions which endeavored to preserve, build on or learn from the
positive aspects of informal services such as flexibility, demand-responsiveness, expression of local
culture, socialization or other key benefits inherent to the informal system.

More information is needed to understand what business models and incentive structures might
lead to interventions that improve financial security and minimize financial risk. How might we gather
more information on the varying business models, how vehicles are funded, built, maintained, and
repaired, and what businesses need to improve or scale their services?

The blended knowledge shows that the drivers and operators are already self-organizing to build
these informal systems. Is there an opportunity to therefore champion their own reforms from the
bottom-up? Is self-organization a first step to facilitate information, conversations, negotiations and
agreements with authorities and government entities? And can better dialogue between authorities
and informal actors lead to more just, sustainable approaches?

Accelerated Impact

Digital technologies have changed the way people use transport services
and work in the industry. In the literature we find examples but we turn to
the interviews with industry experts to better understand the implications
regarding the rise of the super-apps. From the review we see the ways in which
digital technologies are enabling and driving the transformation of the informal
transportation sector. On the positive side, this has resulted in better access
to finance and work, increased security and convenience for passengers, and
more efficient service provision. However, equity concerns remain.

Driving Change

Digitalization helps promote informal transportation as a mainstream option
for work and transport services. Digital platforms have lowered barriers to
work in the sector and drivers can access customers with very little effort
and investment. The companies can in turn scale the service and expand the
network.

As a result, trip patterns are changing. By disrupting hub-based models such
as boda boda stages with individually dispatched drivers, the platforms have
tilted trips away from last-mile legs toward point-to-point trips.38

Enabling Growth

Digitalization enables growth in the sector through better access to finance,
increased security, and improved user information.

For example, access to data can help make financing more available. Money
lenders, banks, and micro-finance institutions are already using digital
transactions and platforms to profile or map beneficiaires.

Roughly 90% of India’s three-wheelers are financed by private entities or
individuals, while only 10% of loans are derived from the formal banking
sector. In response, platforms such as Ola, Gojek, and Gozem — as well as
Three Wheels United — are combining the voluminous data points gleaned
from drivers’ wallets, payments, locations, and trips to build their own de facto
credit scores. Ola’s strategic partnership with the fintech startup Avail, for
example, aims to offer vehicle leasing, loans, and medical insurance to the 1.5
million drivers on its platform.39

03 Going Digital: Super Apps and Beyond

In Kenya, fintech companies are able to track actual revenue/usage via GPS and mobile technology
which makes credit scores easy to obtain. Uber, for example, already uses bank accounts to make
payments. As observed in another learning circle developed by the Accelerator Labs, these digital
footprints enable the creation of a financial track record, leading to pathways to formality for both
operators and drivers.

Cedrick Tandong of Three Wheels United frames his challenge as applying and scaling
microfinancing practices to mobility. Where formal institutions fail, he argues, is in refusing to
tailor standard financing products to the hand-to-mouth existence of informal workers. “The loan
officer wants to collect payments at the end of the month,” he explains, “but the driver has daily
earnings, and he doesn’t have a savings habit.” Rather than asking for relatively large monthly
repayments (which lead to higher rates of default), Three Wheels United requires small payments
daily.40

Traditional microfinance is both high-touch and hyper-local, requiring frequent check-ins by
loan officers and thus leading to higher costs, Tandang notes. Digitization helps solve these
issues through: 1) collecting and correlating finer-grained data than that typically used in formal
lending; 2) machine learning to calculate risk; and 3) low-cost tools for communicating with or
even automatically deducting daily repayments from lenders. Upon analyzing its loan portfolio,
for instance, Three Wheels United surmised only 20% of its borrowers were at significant risk
of default. “We started out thinking every driver was a defaulter, which is not the reality — 80%
actually do pay on time,” he says. This realization meant that it could focus the majority of its
efforts on this narrow slice while using less frequent, lower communication (e.g. occasional text
messages) with the remainder of its portfolio.41

Data is also playing a role in improving the transport service itself. Mapping informal transport
routes has become an important step to improve the service by matching passenger demand
and supply.42 The acquisition of spatial data, such as map routes, helps users plan travel and
understand mobility options which were previously dependent on word of mouth or learning
through experience.

The transformative power of digital technologies in informal transportation, as detailed in
this report, aligns with the discussions presented in the UNDP Accelerator Labs’ blog on how
digitalization is changing what informality looks like. These findings underscore the importance
of continued research and dialogue in harnessing digitalization to foster growth and equity within
informal networks globally.

A Rapidly Changing Field - The Super-App Era

The experts we interviewed emphasized that the speed and impact of digitalization in the recent
past cannot be overstated.

We find different perspectives on the degree of super-app portability across cultural and geographic
contexts. A question raised by the early success of Gozem — an aspiring super-app operating
in 13 cities across eight Francophone nations in West Africa, which boasts of having delivered 5
million trips to 800,000 users to date — is whether the super-app model is portable beyond South/
Southeast Asia. Both the established literature and several of the experts interviewed 43 44 45 insist
that lessons learned in organizing or formalizing transport in one cultural/geographic context
cannot be successfully transplanted elsewhere.

The experience of the super-apps shows us that going digital means expanding beyond transport
services.

Super-apps’ killer app is the wallet. What binds platforms such as Gojek, Ola, and Gozem together
are the digital wallets alternately linked to banks, telcos (e.g. Safaricom’s M-PESA), cash-to-wallet
conversions, or earnings stored and spent entirely within the app. Wallets such as Gojek’s GoPay,
for example, provide the glue between the company’s mobility offerings (e.g. GoRide, GoCar), meal
and grocery delivery (GoFood, GoMart), and eventually the broader e-commerce capabilities from
its 2021 merger with Tokopedia, creating the new holding company GoTo.

Wallets are a crucial part of the super-app model, using customer data and behavior to branch into
new categories and link offerings. Whereas more specialized services might compete on providing
customers with the best experience, super-apps tend to focus on expanding the breadth of services
and best integration between them.

Wallet dominance can impede or accelerate mobility offerings. While Gojek, Ola, and Grab succeeded
in part because they moved swiftly to fill a vacuum with their own wallets at a time when digital
payments were accelerating — Three Wheels United’s Cedrick Tandong says the share of digital
repayments has risen from 10% to 80%46— the presence of a strong incumbent app company can
also pose a significant deterrence to growth. In order to compete against entrenched incumbents
such as SafariCom and MTN Mobile Money, new wallets entering the market like the SafeBoda
Wallet need to compete on the costs associated with using wallets as well as develop additional
services such as eliminating transfer fees, offering interest on savings in the wallet, paying partner
vendors via the wallet, and cash withdrawal from agents.47

Hence there is a strategic need for super-apps to own their wallets and the associated customer

data that comes with it. In addition to telcos and super-apps, a new wave of competitors — such as
fintech Wave, Africa’s first “unicorn” — are jostling for dominance.

However, equity issues remain. Digitalization can also mean that drivers and passengers who cannot
afford smartphones and data do not have the same level of access to the opportunities provided.
Bankability remains a barrier to integrated payment systems. All five experts interviewed touched
on the dearth of digital literacy as a major challenge to equitable access.

We find differing views about the impact digital platforms have had on labor conditions. There are
serious concerns about the exploitative nature of the platform work related to an overall loss of
personal autonomy. Some drivers also lament the loss of community and social interaction which
are minimized through platform work.

In other cases, we see that the platform work is opening opportunities to those previously
marganilized from transport work, including women and transgender drivers who may not have
been accepted within the traditional driver association.
While the platforms seek to control their relationship with drivers, informal digital communities —
often mirroring boda boda stages and their offline counterparts — have flourished in group chats
on tools such as WhatsApp. As Tandong48 noted, Three Wheels United has developed a flourishing
online community in which drivers trade advice and tactics along with an informal marketplace for
renting and/or selling vehicles.

A gap remains between the community level association and the technology company developing
and growing a super-app. In most cases, the evolution of super-apps required constructing custom,
highly proprietary systems that are not only opaque to regulators, but also possess such an
enormous degree of technical debt that efforts to develop publicly available alternatives will never
muster sufficient resources.

Finally, we learn of the aspects of the system which cannot be or are not best served by digital
technology. Scholars such as Rida Qadri have noted that even platforms such as Gojek are still
reliant on drivers’ local knowledge to navigate complex urban landscapes.49

03 Going Digital: Super Apps and Beyond

A Low-Tech, cash-based Reality

While much focus on digitalization surrounds the emergence of super-apps,
experience from the UNDP Accelerator Labs suggests that informal transport
services on the ground are largely low-tech, relying primarily on basic
messaging and wayfinding apps. We also learn from the Accelerator Labs that
cash is still largely prevalent and implementation of cashless payments faces
significant barriers.

For drivers, digitalization has improved city navigation. Accelerator Labs in
Bolivia,50 Guatemala51 and North Macedonia52 reported the use of Google
Maps and the benefits it has provided to more easily locate customers and
find alternative, more efficient routes.

Experience shared by the Labs suggests the application of digital technologies
is effective when focused on linking drivers and customers and harnessing data
that can be used to improve services. So instead of focusing on technology, the
Labs see value in shifting to look first at what issues people are trying to solve
with digital technologies.

Putting Businesses First

The Accelerator Labs affirm that in some cases digitalization gives drivers
better access to work. Ride-share apps lower barriers to work in the sector.
They also help link drivers to customers.

By lowering barriers to entry, drivers are then primarily concerned with finding
customers. They join a platform to establish these relationships, but once
established, both parties often prefer to continue the transaction offline.

According to interviews conducted by several Accelerator Labs, drivers use
apps to find customers but may eventually leave to avoid fees. In Kenya, based
on their field research, the Accelerator Lab identified that users and drivers
tend to use apps just to estimate the price and then negotiate offline prices
without fees.53

Also in Kenya, as operators service school routes, they communicate with parents throughout
the journey to drop their children at school, which creates a relationship of trust. In this way,
WhatsApp allows daily regular communication between customer and driver. This parent-driver
trust relationship also works when the driver is not available, since the driver can recommend a
colleague driver to the parent.54

In Guatemala, a popular app called In Driver, enables anyone to register more easily than Uber.
Drivers and passengers negotiate prices through the app. Rides are cheaper, but the quality of
service is reportedly not as good as Uber.55

Digital payments are not commonly used in many countries. The Labs observe informal workers
generally may remain unbanked because they seek to avoid taxes, do not know how to use the
technology or understand how to receive digital payments. All the Labs reported cash still being
the most widely used form of payment in their geographies. In fact, the Labs find that cashless
payments may instead be a deterrent to drivers who do not want to report financial earnings. It may
also be a deterrent to those drivers and passengers who do not have formal bank accounts to link
to digital platform accounts.

While the Labs did not observe digital solutions such as cashless payments to be a priority or an
incentive, they understand from their experience and research that data can play a role in helping
improve informal transport services. In Guatemala, the Lab learned that user travel demand and
data produced using digital tools could benefit institutions to better understand transportation
needs.56

Leveling the Playing Field

The UNDP Accelerator Labs bring up many equity concerns around digitalization. The Accelerator
Labs know that digital literacy remains low among many of the communities where they work. For
example, in Guatemala, the elderly are still excluded from the digitalization process.57

Victor Awuor, Head of Solution Mapping, UNDP Kenya Accelerator Lab, highlights the socializing
component of community-based informal transport services. Based on their Lab research, the use
of apps is generating a disconnect between informal workers. It becomes a “one man” operation
instead of the traditional solidarity and group support between the drivers.

The Labs learned that digital technologies may threaten the financial viability for low-income drivers
and passengers. This may be due to incurring additional costs through taxes once transactions
become more transparent or due to fees incurred by the formal operation. Digital technologies will
therefore need to consider the financial model for operators, workers, and users.

03 Going Digital: Super Apps and Beyond

In Bolivia, informal transport is very cheap and since not many people have
bank accounts, improving the payment system, such as moving to a cashless
payment system, is not a priority. However, digitalization has the potential
to support the user experience through better routes and increased safety.
“It [digitalization of payments] is not going to be the solution. We need to try
to digitalize other things. For example, timings, vehicle locations, security,”
shares Diego.58

These Insights also cast light on the limitations of digital technology within
the transport sector. They highlight that while digital tools offer solutions
to several operational challenges, they alone may not overcome the
fundamental structural issues that need to be addressed to enhance the
service significantly. For example, digitization can streamline transactions
and improve route planning, but it doesn’t directly address the critical
infrastructural needs or regulatory frameworks that underpin the entire
system.

Centering Users and Workers

From the blended learnings, we see that digital technologies can play a large
role in transforming informal transport services. But the scale and urgency
of their use can vary greatly depending on the local context.

The Labs find that drivers want to find passengers and passengers want a
convenient, safe, affordable service. In many instances, these pain points
are addressed through low-tech offerings. We see through the blended
knowledge that digital technologies could be more inclusive as well as more
legible.

We need a better understanding of the needs drivers, operators or
passengers have that require a digital solution. Particularly, we need to find
more examples in which drivers and operators are centered, such as the
financial model and informal digital community building, provided by Three
Wheels United.

Understanding the Impact

When discussing the environmental or sustainability implications of informal
transportation, most written material focuses on the polluting nature of
informal transportation infrastructure. CO2 emissions and air pollution are
attributed to substandard second hand vehicles and poor maintenance as
well as the inefficient provision of routes.

On the contrary, we did not find many angles to understand how informal
transportation may be positively contributing to environmental sustainability.
Some sources note that vehicles with larger passenger capacities will have
per capita emission advantages.

The Future of Paratransit and Shared Mobility: Mapping Report59 finds that
road-based alternatives such as the ferries in Cote d’Ivoire, may provide
more efficient routes. While the concept of secondhand is largely associated
with being substandard, the report highlights that units, such as pinasses
are produced from locally available wood and recycled tarpaulin.

While we know that the industry thrives on the reuse, recycling, or
repurposing of materials, we did not find explicit references to the scale or
impact of this circular economy.

The main focus of documented knowledge is on electrification. The
acceleration of cleaner fuel or electric vehicles, whether private, for-hail,
formal, or informal is widely perceived as a massive opportunity to curtail
both GHG emissions and air pollution.

The two- and three-wheel marketplace is spearheading the electric mobility
revolution. The relative low costs, proven economics, and marketplace
dominance give it leverage. Bloomberg’s 2022 Electric Vehicle Outlook60
identified electric two and three wheelers as having the biggest share of EV
sales worldwide (with more than 274 million electric two and three wheelers
sold), also responsible for displacing 1,010,228 barrels of oil each day.
Aishwarya Raman, notes that 12.8% of Indian households possess two- or
three-wheelers, compared to 2.3% owning four-wheeled vehicles.61 In June
2020, the Indian government reauthorized its FAME II (Faster Adoption and

Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV) subsidy scheme until 2024, while also increasing the ceiling for
two-wheeler credit by 50%.

Less is written about what is necessary to integrate informal transportation to transport
decarbonization efforts and how to accelerate the adoption of EVs for informal transportation.

Three Wheels United Cedrick Tandong pegs the size of India’s three-wheeled fleet at roughly
7 million, of which roughly 500,000 are replaced each year, meaning that if EV alternatives were
widely available and at a cost parity with current petrol models, it would still take until 2036 to turn
over. How can we accelerate similar adoption rates? What are the most effective tactics, tools, and
messaging to encourage drivers and/or owners to switch? To make more affordable EV models
available? And to provide financing? Because as Tandong notes, while 90% of India’s three-wheelers
are financed, only 10% of financing stems from traditional institutions.62

There are immediate gaps in the literature that must be filled before mounting any large-scale
campaign to turn over informal fleets in favor of EVs — such as reliable tallies of the number of
vehicles operating in most cities; their age; their fuel consumption; and a reliable measure of GHG
and air pollution.63

04 On Sustainability: Opening the Discussion

Creating Incentives

The Accelerator Labs from Guatemala64 and Bolivia65 find that digital technologies
can play a big role in making informal transport more sustainable. As discussed
previously, mapping software is helping improve route efficiency which reduces the
consumption and emissions from fuels.

Data can play an important role in creating awareness on environmental issues
for the government and the public. The Accelerator Labs pointed out that most
countries where they work do not have any regulations regarding emissions controls,
resulting in a lack of data. Awareness is therefore based on perspectives rather than
fact. In Bolivia, for example, drivers associate pollution with large vehicles, such
as commercial vehicles or garbage trucks 66. In other contexts, pollution is only
perceived if the exhaust produces black smoke.

It will be difficult to build arguments around sustainability without baseline data
and wider understanding of sustainability principles. Paola Constantino, Head of
Solution Mapping, UNDP Guatemala Accelerator Lab, wonders what sustainable
practices may be uncovered if framed in a way that is more identifiable to the
informal operators.67

Financial incentives are required for drivers or operators to upgrade or change
to hybrid or electric models. In Bolivia, drivers attributed the unit affordability to
their decision to switch. Sustainability reasons did not factor in their decision.68 This
coincides with insights shared in our interviews with experts.

Financial incentives need to go beyond the loan offer to include sustainable business
models. In Kenya, where incentives are given to purchase an electric two-wheeler,
the Lab has seen large numbers of vehicles confiscated due to loan defaults.69

While the literature widely states that old vehicles are an issue, there is less knowledge
about how to decommission them. In Kenya, the Lab understands older matatus are
relegated to certain routes, but is unsure of how old boda bodas are disposed of.

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Guatemala highlighted how a solar tuk-tuk project in
the country shows the way a local ecosystem can support changing old vehicles into
cleaner, greener ones. By looking at these examples, we can learn what’s needed
to make sure these cleaner vehicles can be repaired and maintained easily, which
can encourage more people to use them. It’s not just about making new types of
vehicles but also about giving drivers reasons to switch, like making it affordable
and providing the right parts and services.

04 On Sustainability: Opening the Discussion

Building a Foundation for
Change

It seems the negative narrative surrounding informal transportation extends to
discussions regarding its environmental sustainability. The negative impacts are
often repeated but deserve more nuance. Informal transport vehicles are seen as
polluting agents, often invisibilizing their role as shared mobility and essentially
public transport in many cities, providing transport access to mostly vulnerable
populations as SDG #11 aims. The discussion needs to deepen in terms of how
that access can be sustained, while improving vehicle and operational efficiency.

The role of technology and digitalization offers enormous opportunities not
only to improve operational efficiency (e.g. by better route planning), but also to
gather data on the numbers of operators, current levels of emissions (baseline
data to make the case for climate funds to support a transition towards zero
emissions vehicles), and daily/monthly income necessary to leverage access to
investment or funds to electrify informal transport vehicles.

Finally, better data can also help countries in doing better planning, whether
it is identifying and planning where to develop electric charging infrastructure
to support vehicle electrification efforts; integrating and better planning public
transport along with informal transport; improving user experience; or making
public transport better and more attractive to avoid the trend of users shifting to
private vehicles as soon as they have the means to do so.

There is a local supply chain of mechanics who take second-hand vehicles
exported from the Global North and adapt them for use in informal transportation,
especially for 4-wheelers. The chassis and vehicle bodies are refurbished, seats
replaced, body repainted and often engines are replaced -- upcycling the used
vehicle for use as informal transport.

We could imagine infusing that supply chain with the knowledge, skills, and tools
to repower the same used vehicles with EV engines and components.

The age and types of vehicles offers an opportunity to open a discussion
about the life cycle of vehicles not only within each country, but also, about
secondhand vehicles from the Global North being imported and operating in
the Global South. Particularly considering strong ongoing efforts in electrifying
public transportation in Global North cities, understanding the displaced vehicles
will likely end up in Global South cities, likely adapted and used on informal
transportation, there needs to be an increased responsibility regarding what
happens to those vehicles at their end of life.

Pollution may still be a vague concept for many, including policy makers. It is
therefore difficult to advocate change or design regulations without sufficient
awareness and public support.

Identifying Vulnerabilities

As discussed in previous sections, informal transport fosters livelihood
opportunities for many people in the Global South, both for the drivers and
operators who gain their income directly from these activities, and for the
passengers whom informal transport enables to connect to work and study
opportunities.

Research in Kampala described the city’s 145,000 boda bodas as “time-space
compressors” because they provide mobility and income opportunities,
intertwining the city and the lives of its residents.70 Similarly, informal transport,
far from providing livelihood opportunities only in large cities, is key to rural
communities. One study in Rongo (Kenya) showed that motorcycle cabs
improve rural mobility and complement many public transport systems by
facilitating access to markets and workplaces.71 In Uganda, informal transport
was found to significantly improve women’s livelihoods by alleviating their
“time poverty,” turning time into a resource for pursuing opportunities.72

However, despite the significant contribution of informal transport to
improving opportunities, vulnerable groups may be excluded from these
services or have negative perceptions about them. The literature reports
instances where overcrowded vehicles and poorly regulated public spaces
used by or surrounding informal transport, allow for touching, groping and
other forms of harassment towards women.73 Even though sexual harassment
is an imminent risk in all forms of public transport, some reports suggest that
the anonymity and lack of control of unregulated, informal transport increases
the possibility for sexual abuse or violence to go unpunished,74 dissuading
women from using informal transport to commute to work because of safety
concerns.75 Women attempting to enter the market as drivers or operators
may also face more barriers and abuses in a sector mainly dominated by men.76

Other populations to be considered when analyzing transport with a gender perspective, for
instance, trans and non-binary people, are part of the industry as drivers, operators or users as
well.77 However, we found very little research that explores their contributions, their participation
and the challenges they face.

People living with disabilities may also be left out of the informal transportation sector, facing limited
accessibility to vehicles and infrastructure, and no investment, incentives or regulation to ensure
universal access to these services.78 Additionally, Porter and Turner (2019) (cited by Behrens et al.
(2021) found that young students in countries or cities where they are entitled to reduced fares on
public transport, are frequently barred by operators and drivers from traveling on minibuses, often
with the threat of violence.79

It’s worth mentioning that the majority of research found on equity in this sector has thus far been
conducted by academic institutions based in African countries. There’s a significant gap in equity
research in Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia.80

Zooming in on Context

The UNDP Accelerator Labs found both positive and negative experiences faced
by different groups of people, including those working in the sector, and those
using informal transport systems. For example, in Guatemala during their
field work, the Lab found that women who are drivers of motor taxi services
find a sense of freedom and independence in their job. Nonetheless, various
Labs pointed out that security can be an issue for female users. As mentioned
before, sexual harassment therefore becomes an important component that
affects users’ decisions regarding choice and determines a big part of their
experience using informal transportation.

Evidence collected by the Labs on the ground found informal transport can
serve as an inclusive mode of transport for excluded or vulnerable communities
or populations, or the complete opposite. For instance, in North Macedonia
informal transport helps connect communities with low or non-existent access
to public transport access,81 while in Lebanon, the Lab found informal transport
operators charging migrant workers a higher transport fee than locals.82 Labs
found that populations such as the disabled or elderly are still facing exclusion
from these transport modes as well because of a lack of accessible vehicles,
particularly boda-bodas in Kenya83 and motorcycle taxi services in Guatemala.84

Different Labs, however, found socialization linked to the informal transport
sector as an important element for reducing vulnerability and improving a
sense of community, particularly for drivers and operators in their cities. For
instance, the Kenya Accelerator Lab85 highlighted that one key benefit that
informal transport systems have on drivers is the socialization that occurs
in Boda Boda Stations. The Accelerator Lab from Bolivia also highlighted
the benefit of socialization but attributed it with being part of a worker’s
association.86 These findings are consistent with findings from researchers such
as Rida Qadri on the value of mutual aid and socialization between workers to
improve resilience, security, well-being and even their business operations.87

Investing in the Future

The blended knowledge points to many different experiences working in and
using informal transportation. Where it creates more economic opportunities
for some, it still excludes others. Where it ensures an increase in personal
safety for some, others still experience harassment and other issues. It is
clear that informal services need to provide better safety and security for
workers and passengers. Public spaces where these services operate also
need to be safer, more inclusive places for the people in these communities.
The degree to which these are issues unique to informal transportation
rather than public transportation more generally, is discussed as well.

What is less understood in this research is the access to opportunities within
the transport sector which would allow drivers and operators to grow their
businesses and compete in the industry. What is the growth trajectory in
this sector? How might individuals or operators not just access microfinance
loans but attract large investments to compete at scale? More research could
be done to understand the potential business opportunity in this sector and
how a more equitable approach could lead to more sustainable solutions.

Continuums of Formality

In the previous sections we have established that most systems already possess
some degree of informality and formality. In this section we try to understand
and identify models that integrate informal practices and formal tools to
improve transportation work and service.

A hybrid model may involve a semi-formal system in which the service is legally
authorized but operates under informal rules (dispersed property, daily rent of
vehicles, noncompliance with labor laws). Another hybrid approach may focus
on integrating the formal and informal modes of transportation. Hybridity may
also result from a focus on supporting informal labor rather than the informal
service.

Integration

We also previously discussed the integration of formal and informal systems as a hybrid option.
Primarily, we found examples in Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania where informal modes are fed
and distributed from exchanges with an existing or newly established formal bus system.93 According
to some authors, the common rationale for this approach is that the lower vehicle operating cost of
smaller informal transport services make them better suited to lower volume and lower frequency
neighborhood routes, and the lower labor cost of larger buses make them better suited to higher
volume and higher frequency trunk routes.94 This hybrid approach has been widely studied in the
City of Cape Town, where the informal transport systems operates as a network of feeders to the
formal Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) services.95 Roger Behrens et al. stated that several sources point out
that the BRT policy in Cape Town paved the way for local government to lead public transport reform,
which opened channels of engagement at the municipal level with informal transport operators and
has been seen as an effective upgrade of existing formal modes of public transport, rather than a
replacement of informal transport 96.

Labor, Not Service

In questioning the parameters of formalization, our experts identified the formalization of informal
work (centering the driver, rather than the service), as a possible focal area. In the literature we
find examples of this, for example the Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) and Transport
Management Companies (TMCs) in Kenya have been a particular focus of study and provide a
positive example of how changes in business structures have realized beneficial effects. Behrens
et al. (2017b) explored the organization of inter-city matatu SACCOs and found that in most cases
service quality improvements were achieved by shifting from the ‘target system’ for drivers to matatu
driver salaries97 (Behrens et al, 2021)

While we did not identify specific examples within the Accelerator Lab countries,
they did give us insights as to what a hybrid model should achieve. The common
sentiment is that a hybrid model should provide an alternative way forward
that maximizes the benefits and reduces the drawbacks.

informal

The first is the realization that the informal system is not an outlier needing to
be curbed, eliminated, or assimilated into a formal one, but rather a thriving
entrepreneurial ecosystem of SMEs yearning for support and recognition —
without stifling fees and bureaucracy.

Second, given the emergence of super-apps in South and Southeast Asia and
the governments eager to partner with them, the question is no longer whether
informal transport can ever be legitimized — it already is — but rather how to
level the playing field on behalf of individual workers by offering assistance with
digital payments, financing vehicles, forming communities and cooperatives,
and new public infrastructure, just to name a few possibilities.

An alternative approach therefore could ask: how best can formal sector
partners assist workers with bottom-up formalization while using data gleaned
from these improvements to increase passenger safety and sustainability?

06 Embracing Hybrid Approaches: A Semi-Formal Futurel

In our research, we find various examples of hybrid approaches to improving informal transport
work and services. Additional research could be done to better understand and explore the potential
to build on the following examples:

1. Low-cost, universally accessible digital public
infrastructure, starting with payments.

While relatively few nations possess the resources
and strong central bank needed to stand up
such infrastructure on its own, other nations
with large informal transport sectors such as the
Philippines are pushing ahead with digitalization
efforts. These types of experiences suggest an
opportunity and necessity to carry out policy-
oriented research , that might assist governments
in exploring publicly-owned or at least accessible
alternatives to the capabilities of the super apps
— wallets, maps, and dispatching — to enhance
individual drivers’ competitiveness, while also
generating data that can be captured and
shared with policymakers to improve the larger
ecosystem.

For example, India’s Unified Payments Interface98
(UPI) — developed by the National Payments
Corporate of India and launched in 2016 — offers
instant settlement of payments across more than
300 banks, with billions of monthly transactions
worth more than $100 billion. Several experts
affiliated with super apps noted in interviews how
the UPI has propelled India to be the global leader
in digital payments overall. No less than Google
has recommended the United States model
its own government-backed payment system
(“FedNow”) on India’s.

Research has found several advantages for
creating a public digital wallet for transportation.
All-cash payments create opportunities for crime,
violence, and corruption. Allowing super-apps and
other private entities to dominate digital wallets
can lead to risks for financial regulators. Investing
in universally available infrastructure can support
and accelerate digitalization and innovation, as

06 Embracing Hybrid Approaches: A Semi-Formal Futurel

2. Technology that combines formal and
informal modes, creating a public alternative to
the super-apps.

transportation systems and

Can software solve the tension between formal
informal
public
operators by allowing passengers to book trips
on either or both through the same interface
and payment system? After all, ride-hailing apps
such as Uber and Gojek have done exactly that in
New York (taxis) and Jakarta (MTR), while Berlin’s
BVG has built its own “mobility-as-a-service” app
combining the city’s entire public transportation
system and private sharing services on a single
platform. How might a city do the same with
informal services as well?

One public agency doing just that is the Kochi
Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Open Kochi

initiative. Inaugurated on November 1, 2020,
the KMTA is India’s first digitally native MTA,
tasked with integrating, planning, and regulating
different modes in the capital of southeast India’s
Kerala state. Open Kochi is creating an “open
mobility network” powered in turn by a set of
open, interoperable protocols named Beckn that
can theoretically support informal- as well as
formal services.

Although nascent, these examples suggest a
need for further understanding and exploration
on how governments might implement hybrid
formalization in practice in much the same way as
the super apps.

3. Regulatory sandboxes where the government
can experiment with hybrid formalization

In her expert interview, the Ola Mobility Institute’s
Aishwarya Raman noted that several Indian cities
have approached Ola for assistance in creating
“regulatory sandboxes” — physical enclaves
where existing laws are suspended — where new
approaches to regulation and provisioning can
be tested. “There is a role civil society has to play
here,” she said.99

To that end, there is an opportunity for further
exploration and research, perhaps partnering
with driver associations or similar groups to test
different arrangements and tendering (along
with the technological capabilities mentioned
above). Zones are a tried-and-true approach to
context-specific experimental integration or (de-)
regulation.

4. Focus on the drivers, not the service.

Literature and experiential learning from the
Labs point to the potential to continue to explore
the possibility and potential of formalization
processes being focused on drivers, not the
service per se. India has led the way in this,
with the new labor codes of 2019-2020,100 which
enshrined the legal status of gig workers and
extended social security benefits such maternity
leave, disability insurance, gratuity, and health
insurance regardless of employer. While these
reforms still await implementation, they hold
the potential to transform labor’s relationship
with governments and platforms alike — and
could prove to be a model for others. Could the
UNDP Accelerator Labs take part in exploring
and co-creating innovative codes and regulations
that change the narrative on informal transport
around the world?

5. Digital-first driver communities.

While our research found that many driver
associations in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere
traditionally tend to be territorial and rent-
seeking, working for the super-apps has spawned
new communities that are ad hoc, peer-to-
peer, and digital first, thriving in group chats on
WhatsApp. In some cases, these groups have
coalesced around non-profits and vendors such
as Three Wheels United, the latter of which hosts
an informal marketplace for renting and/or selling
vehicles. Insights from the Labs also showed the
entrepreneurial nature of these systems, often at

the individual or even family level. Learning how
these communities formed — and developing
a method to identify locally important actors
and institutions who can help create new ones
— could be an important first step to building
an alternative to both local incumbents and
opaque super-apps. Once formed, these new
communities could provide valuable insights and
better understanding on how to tackle issues such
as safety and wages, offering real-time insights
and communication that were previously missing
or fragmented.

6. How informal transport can participate in the
electric vehicle transition

Globally, governments are earmarking hundreds
of billions of dollars in tax credit and subsidies
for electric vehicles, correctly identifying them
as pivotal to lowering carbon emissions. But
these large figures and bold headlines have not
matched reality. For example, India’s $1.3 billion
FAME subsidy announced in April 2019 pledged
to electrify 500,000 three-wheelers and a million
two-wheelers. In two years, it achieved only a
fraction of each. Learning from its mistakes, the
Indian government is pushing ahead with a new
initiative to put a million EVs on the roads, this
time by offering to work through intermediaries
such as Three Wheels United and provide 60% of
new vehicle financing, which will in turn lower the
organization’s own borrowing costs and reduce
vehicle costs by 20%.

On the other hand, Uber, Gojek and others have
pledged ambitious ESG goals to their investors,
with Gojek promising to become a “carbon-
neutral” company by 2030, with a 100% EV fleet.
These pledges are complicated by the fact they do
not own their fleets — drivers do. Gojek’s response
was to partner with Gogoro in November 2021 to
build-and-operate 5,000 e-scooters and charging

stations the company rents to drivers on its
platform, and to partner with Indonesia’s TBS
Energi Utama in December 2021 on a new a joint
venture to manufacture electric two-wheelers,
battery packaging, and battery swap stations,
along with financing. Ola has also designed and
sold its own electric scooters to drivers.
Further research and exploration on how public-
fund
private partnerships can
distribution, ensure the investment in public
charging infrastructure, and monitor performance
could be beneficial in accelerating the sector’s
transition towards electric mobility.

improve EV

In addition to this and based on findings on the
need to understand operators and workers’
needs, further exploration and research regarding
how to design the best models for engaging
and supporting workers and operators for the
transition towards electric mobility is essential.
Issues such as financial literacy — how to save for
payments or changing the structure of the loans
— will be key to a successful integration of the
sector in global electrification and decarbonization
efforts.

7. Sharing data between drivers, government,
and super-apps.

For more than a decade, mapping companies
such as Waze and the super-apps have leveraged
users’ real-time GPS data to create a competitive
advantage. Occasionally, these companies have
voluntarily shared data with cities and NGOs
pertaining to safety and congestion. In 2016,
for example, the World Bank launched the Open
Transport Partnership in conjunction with several
mobility companies — including 500,000 drivers
for Grab — to aggregate speed and congestion
data in several nations across Southeast Asia
and Latin America. Other initiatives are analyzing
passenger and demand data to improve services.
For example, Jetty is an app connecting passengers
with drivers of mini-bus routes in Mexico City.
Data from each trip is analyzed and shared
with fleet operators, with whom the company

discusses potential new routes, vehicle types, and
driver wages and insurance. It does so in hopes
of encouraging drivers and owners to upgrade
and standardize service across the entire system,
acting as a self-described “microregulator.”

Our findings suggest that regulators still have
difficulties in setting requirements for apps to
share anonymized data, as many cities in the
Global North already do. There are opportunities
for further research and exploration on how
governments and local authorities could set up
the best policy and regulation in order to gain
access to such data and make use of it (potentially
in partnership with private operators), to improve
informal transport services and systems.

8. New financing models for equity and inclusion.

Three Wheels United has succeeded in financing
new vehicles profitably and sustainably where
its driver-centric
others have failed through
approach, which includes the construction of its
own de facto credit score through monitoring
individual drivers’ behavior and partnering with
super-apps such as Uber to import drivers’ history
on such platforms. While such scoring is a genuine
innovation in pooling risk more effectively, it
also raises concerns about the transparency

and fairness of such scoring. (Uber’s own model
for rating drivers, for example, is opaque for
competitive reasons.) Further research of these
types of innovations, for instance partnering with
organizations such as Three Wheels United to
voluntarily audit the composition of these scores,
could be an important step in creating additional
knowledge and best practices for ensuring
financial inclusion.

59

06 Embracing Hybrid Approaches: A Semi-Formal Futurel

9. Design data aggregation, retention, and
sharing policies along with privacy standards
for informal transport.

The hybrid formalization initiated by the super-
apps is reliant on persistent surveillance to ensure
passenger safety and financial compliance, raising
serious concerns about drivers’ right to privacy.
While passengers and regulators might decide
the tradeoffs are worth it, there is still much work
to be done in understanding the best way to

design standards for how such data is collected,
how long it is retained, who it is shared with, and
how it can be combined with other data sets and
to what end. (See #8 above.) Further research to
understand these issues and effectively regulate
them is key.

60

Moving Forward

The blended knowledge shows there is still much to learn and understand
about informal transportation. Moving forward, it is clear more dialogue is
needed with diverse sources to open up new and different ways of seeing
informal transportation.

Based on this blended learning journey, we know opportunities exist to
integrate, strengthen, and improve informal services and work on the ground.
Rather than trying to eliminate these services, it is possible to maximize the
qualities identified (flexibility, connectivity, affordability), while minimizing
the drawbacks (passenger safety, pollution).

The opportunity at hand is to bring greater visibility to this sector. We need a
deeper understanding of the essential role informal transportation plays in
peoples’ lives, the economy, and the environment.

Key questions remain.

The blended research shows there are cases in which digital technologies
have transformed the way people use and work in new mobility. It also shows
that digital technology is not a priority for many others in the sector. There
is a need to better understand the issues which are a priority to passengers,
drivers, operators, and others in the wider ecosystem and then identify how
digital technologies can play a role in resolving the issue.

What do informal businesses need to thrive? What role can digital technologies
play in improving services for passengers, drivers, and operators?

Similarly, more data is needed to set priorities and identify strategic entry
points to achieve environmental impact at scale. From the blended research,
we know electrification presents an
immense opportunity, however
greenhouse gas emission reduction estimates are lacking to make it a more
visible priority. We also learned that financing for any solutions, such as new
technologies, needs to be tailored to the specific needs of the operators and
small businesses that largely make up the informal transport sector.

How should we measure environmental impact for this sector? What is the
potential scale of environmental impact? And what is needed to achieve it?

61

Here’s how we can answer these questions:

Adding Voices

The voices of informal transportation drivers, operators, and passengers are
still overwhelmingly absent from international discussions, regulation and
decision-making processes on the future of transport. These spaces are often
very Global North-focused, ignoring the reality, context and experiences of
most cities and towns where informal transport is the norm and an absolute
necessity. In order to have truly inclusive and context-specific transport
discussions that leave no one behind, we need to provide platforms for these
voices to be heard and learned from.

There are many ways to enable and facilitate these types of conversations,
such as podcasts or blog series focused on the needs and reality of transport
in specific regions or of specific actors of the informal transport ecosystem,
including users, operators and drivers. Informal Transport Meet and Greets
or Convenings can also provide a platform for conversations to happen
between researchers, practitioners and other actors involved in the sector;
to share experiences, knowledge and build a community of practice.

GPIT will also engage with partners who are focused on facilitating city level
engagements to bring this conversation to more decision makers and join
efforts for a common goal.

Making the Sector Visible

There are many examples of innovative approaches to digitalization,
integration, regulation and organization of informal transport services
around the world that we could all learn from. However, there is very
little documentation available to learn from these experiences. Collecting
information and drafting out case studies reflecting these innovative
approaches to working with informal transport could be a practical way to
build upon that knowledge base. Expanding other types of crowdsourced
and context-specific documentation exercises such as the Encyclopedia of
Informal Transportation in Central America and the Glossary of Popular
(Informal) Transportation can involve actors from different countries in
raising awareness and documenting what informal transport looks like, how
it operates, local regulation around it, user experience, and other relevant
details that are essential for the sector to gain relevance and visibility. What
is not known, what is not measured and documented can hardly be improved
upon.

We hope to find and reach out to partners who are trying alternative
approaches. These partners may include advocates, practitioners, or local and
national governments. While this research identified many possibilities and
collected some examples where hybrid policies are being applied, we believe
there are many cases to still learn from which we did find. Working through

62

the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network and developing new inroads through online communities, such
as Discord, may yield more examples.

In addition to documenting case studies, we need more opportunities to experiment. How might we
acknowledge the essential role of informal transportation and find ways to integrate, strengthen and
improve the informal services on the ground today instead of attempting to make them disappear?
Current or upcoming transport projects and funding from development banks, international
cooperation agencies or organizations could offer opportunities to innovate, pilot or experiment in
different cities. But to open up these opportunities, it is essential that informal transportation also
be recognized and integrated in international discussions and programs discussing the future of
transport, cities and climate.

Interview with Experts

From November to December 2021, the consulting team spoke with three current experts, along
with two representatives of so-called “super-apps” — a new generation of integrated mobility,
banking, and commerce apps blurring the line between “formal” and “informal.” As part of their
agreement to participate, the names and affiliations of the latter have been redacted from this
public-facing report.

Orientation on Informal Transportation

The consulting team created an overview of informal transportation to orient participating
accelerator labs.

Lab Field Research

The consulting team provided each Accelerator Lab with a series of google templates, included in
the Annex, to guide the field research including:

Field Research Guide (Google Sheet), to help formulate and design interview questions
Field Research Plan Template (Google Sheet) to help the Labs to outline their own questions
Interview Template (Google Doc) to document interviews notes from each Lab.
Field Research Submission Table to gather main findings from each Lab.

Campfire Sessions

The campfire session aims to create a casual environment in which participants can openly share
insights. A series of prompts are used to facilitate the dialogue, but it is not considered a strict
outline. In many instances, insights shared in one session became a finding relevant to a question
from another session.

Campfire Session Outlines

Campfire Session 1
Held on 03/30/2022
Participants included: Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon, Kenya, and North Macedonia.

Perception and Motivation Prompts

1 - What are the main actors? What roles do they play in the system and what are their reasons for

playing those roles?

2 - How do the actors earn? What expenses do they have?
3 - How would you describe the vehicles? Anything unique?

Equity Prompts

4 - What works well for women, children, Persons with disabilities, and the elderly? What doesn’t

work well?

Informal Transport
actors do not think that
they are informal
because there are aspects
that bring a sense of formality

Despite not fully intervening
in the operation of informal
transport, formal authorities do get
involved in some aspects,
not always through
formal channels

Women drivers find
independence and
freedom in informal
transport

Informal transportation is not
always the only option.
Users chose it for very specific
purposes even over formal
transportation

Informal transport is
seen as a family
business.
Entire families could be
part of the system

PERCEPTIONS AND
MOTIVATIONS

Associations are an
important actor in the system.
They are powerful and have
political influence. There is a
motivation to be part of one.

Road safety in informal
transport is a common
issue.

In some cases informal
systems address
discrimination and in
others, perpetuates it.

Low price makes it
accessible to more people

There are positive
and negative
security experiences,
especially for
women passegers.

People in conditions of
vulnerability have
different experiences
regarding informal
transport

66

Socialization is a key
benefit for drivers

EQUITY

Women drivers have
a positive experience
regarding their work.

Campfire Session 2
Held on 04/27/2022
Participants included: Bolivia, Guatemala, Lebanon, Kenya, and North Macedonia.

Digitalization Prompts:

1 - What kinds of digital technology are being used and for what part of the service? What problems
are they trying to solve with them? Are these super-apps/ external apps or custom solutions?
2 - What has improved or not improved with digitalization? What/who has or has not benefited?

What are some things digital technologies are not solving or are not able to solve?

3 - At an aggregated level, how are digital technologies changing informal transportation in your

country?

Digital payments are one of
the main improvements
achieved through the
digitalization processes

Due to the local context, in
some countries, it has not
been possible for digital
payment to become the
most used mode

For drivers, digitalization has
improved city navigation.

The availability and use
of these applications
changes depending on
the city.

A diversity of
international and local
mobile apps have
broken into the informal
transport sector

Digitalization helps to
connect drivers with users
through apps.

Once the driver-user
relationship is
establisehd, both
parties tend to prefer
to negotiate offline.

DIGITALIZATION

Digitalization is helping to
formalize the sector.

Data produced with the
digitalization of the sector
could generate benefits for
users and decision makers.

Fintech and credit
institutions are already
taking advantage of the
data produced by digital
tools.

Digitalization has
made it easier for
anyone to become a
driver.

DIGITALIZATION

Operators/drivers,
risk exposing their
operations/finances
and absorbing
additional costs

67

Digitalization contributes to
improving specific of informal
transport but does not
solve structural callenges

Digitalization is
reducing the
socializing
component
associated with
informal transport

DIGITALIZATION

Digital literacy
exludes some users.

Environmental Sustainability Prompts:

4 - Does or can informal transport contribute to environmental sustainability? How? Are these

contributions significant at an aggregated level?

5 - What incentives, messages, tactics, or tools encourage drivers/owners/operators to transition

to more sustainable practices? What is missing or should exist?

Drivers are unaware of their impact
and tend to associate pollution with
industry or large trucks.

In some of the countries
there are no regulations
regarding emission
control.

There are efforts to move
informal transport away
from fossil fuels and towards
electrification or hybrid models.

Vehicles are often old
imported models with
low efficiency.

The vast majority of
vehicles used in informal
transport are fossil fueled
vehicles.

ENVIRONMENTAL
SUSTAINABLITY

Positive environmental
aspects: carsharing - less
passenger/Fuel L

Technology/digitalization
on could help the
informal transport
sector to raise
awareness of impact
on the environment

68

Campfire Session 3
Held on 05/04/2022
Participants included: Guatemala, Lebanon, Kenya, North Macedonia, and Togo.

Formalization Prompts:

1 - What drives formality? What is trying to be formalized (operations, social security, payment, etc)

and where is that motivation coming from? Where are we finding resistance?

2 - What are the trade-offs with formalizing? What/who does formality help? What/who does it harm?
3 - What are the main components of formality? What are the minimum components of formality

needed?

Policy Models Prompts:

4 - What elements of informal transportation do we want to keep for the future? What do we want

to change?

5 - What should the next generation of informal and informal transport services of today look like in

the future? Do you have any examples?

For operators, a driver for
formalization is financial
inclusion and the possibility
of accessing credit.

Operators do not
consider themselves
“informal”; they see themselves as
entrepreneurs, seeking
stability in formalization.

Motivations of governments
and decision-makers
to formalize the sector are
often not clear.

From the point of
view of
Operators/Drivers,
there is resistance to
being formalized,
since they would
have to assume
formalizing costs.

FORMALIZATION

Informal transport systems
could lose ther flexible
nature with formalization.

Operators and decision
makers do not have
open communication
so they do not have a
space to discuss how
the formalization
process could be.

Formalizacion needs
incentives (subsidies).

Communities could be left
out of the formal routes.

Both decision
makers and users
seek to guarantee
security and fair
prices with the
formalization.

FORMALIZATION

Formalization
needs to
guarantee
- Coverage
- Safety
- Affordability
- Openness to operate
- Legality
