> Title of the innovation

Commercial egg production keeping about 30000 layers

> Brief description of the innovation

Commercial egg production to be based in Kaoma is a viable business venture which I aim to produce about 1000 eggs per day making a total of 65,000 kwacha per day and a total of 1, 950, 000 kwacha per month. Investment will commence at point of lay. I also aim to provide employment to the youth, more protein on the table and value addition to the produce.

I have the relevant experience and knowledge in chicken poultry production as I am currently engaged as an SME. 

My only hurdle to the implementation of this via business project is start up capital. I am requesting that you come to my aid so that I can purchase 30,000 point of lay birds, poultry feed, vaccines and housing

All these inputs are readily available and easily accessible.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income through the sell of eggs for commercial and home consumption. The market is readoly available, production site and additional start up labour.

The innovation will provide both backward and forward linkages. I aim to supply my products at a commercial/ wholesale and retail. By supply to domestic markets we will reduce on damage caused in transportation, reduce the market price and value addition.

Value addition interms of packaging of the product

> Technical Feasibility

The commercial poultry egg production is designed in such a way that the 30,000 point of lay layers birds must be purchased at point of lay to reduce the cost of feed and vaccines from chicks to point of lay.

The production will be based in kaoma and estimated egg production per day will be 1000. giving us a total of 65,000 kwacha per day and 1,950, 000 kwacha per month. On a start basis I will employ 10 employees to assist in the production process feed and water supply, vaccines and temperature control and guards.

It is expected that the chicken will be sold after completing 2years of lay from the first egg production. I also aim to expand the program in every province of Zambia.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Egg market is readily available in every market but though done on a small scale. Expanding it to commercial level will reduce the cost of egg products, increase employment levels and above all more proteins on the table.
Currently the cost of tray of eggs is at 65 kwacha per tray and supply is too low. Am taking advantage of the supply chain, readily available market and linkages
