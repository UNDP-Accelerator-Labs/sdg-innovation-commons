## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Mi Barrio (Digital neighborhood)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the systematic scaling of citizen participation for better decision-making because the social distancing caused by the pandemic has impacted trust among vulnerable neighborhood residents, reducing their ability to collaborate towards community solutions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Citizen participation is an essential element in the generation of public policies, however, the existing mechanisms are insufficient to reflect and respond to the large amount of information generated by citizens from their respective neighborhoods. Digital neighborhood, intends to become a tool that allows citizens to co-create their solutions, as well as being a powerful tool that allows generating information for decision-making and the generation of public policy based on evidence.
To achieve the stated objective, it has been proposed to implement the UNDP Acceleration Laboratory methodology locally together with the Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz and in alliance with the Madrid City Council, who have identified the Laboratory as an opportunity to respond to the challenge of the digitization of citizen participation for and their daily challenges, based on the co-creation of solutions that allow them to generate focused public policies based on evidence.
This proposal aims to provide citizens with a digital tool where they can find detailed information about the neighborhood, that is, a Digital Neighborhood Platform: where they can find modules with information, training for residents, the dissemination of their own services and capacities, and the neighborhood participation in decision-making.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The pandemic deepened the social and economic problems of the neighborhoods of the municipality of La Paz. The situation in the neighborhoods is very complex and a systemic analysis was needed to have a comprehensive and shared vision of the problems. Furthermore, co-creation was the only way for citizens to identify viable solutions. Since our Acc Lab worked with these tools, we were the perfect actor to meet this challenge. The process began with a characterization of the neighborhood, identifying its needs, including strengthening its social cohesion, new employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, and community communication. As a consequence of the Barrio Digital experiment carried out in a neighborhood of the municipality of La Paz, the municipality requested the scaling to all the neighborhoods of the municipality of La Paz”.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Mi Barrio is a digital platform co-built with citizens to respond to their problems that allows and communicates directly with them, shares their concerns, and finds solutions from their neighbors, under the principle of collaboration, becoming a means that helps to exercise effective and proactive social control.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can the co-creation of a digital platform created by citizens play a role in the social cohesion of the citizens of the city?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Collective intelligente, Co-creation and participatory design allow citizens to decide about theirselves based on the knowledge of their reality and that is essential because it creates engagement for an active participation in the experiment. Prototyping and proof of concept provided us the necessary evidence to answer our learning question

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Since social cohesion could be perceived in a qualitative way, the sources of data mentioned above allowed us to know the perception of change of neighborhoods of San Sebastian especially in the way they identified their needs and planned their goals.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can local youth play a role to improve decision-making process of a neighborhood?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We implemented a pilot activity with local young people to gather information about neighborhood assets and needs using tecnhological tools. Based on this information citizens could improve their decision-making process as a neighborhood.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There were no detailed data about neighborhoods. Even old neighbors did not know some data about their neighborhood, so these new sources of data effectively address information gaps.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

GAMLP is the natural actor that is scaling this challenge since it is focused on improving neighborhoods through innovation and technology. In addition, GAMLP is implementing the new Mi Barrio online platform to promote citizen and neighborhood participation, and our experiment is the perfect complement to their efforts.
