## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

 1. ACTING ON THE STREETS. Extending actions onto the streets, beyond the framework of an institution, contribute to spark interest, include a broader diversity of participants, and respond to limitations of the current COVID-19 crisis by having interactions outdoors.

2. ACTIVE DIRECT AND ALTERNATIVE FEEDBACK CHANNEL HELPS IDENTIFY SUBTLETIES. Designing or having access to alternative feedback channels, like participating in local WhatsApp groups, contribute to a better understanding of local dynamics or changes in context that may offer insights or relevant feedback for iterations.

3. RECOGNIZING EACH OTHER IS A BASIC STEP TOWARDS INCREASING TRUST AND ADDRESSING UNCERTAINTY AS A COMMUNITY. The physical interventions (activities in PILARES centers) created a shared space for people while participating in a workshop. This type of activities enables people to start recognizing each other —even outside of the community center or intervention— and place a more positive association to such random encounters, which helps build the idea that there are positive aspects to the neighborhood and its people too, especially contexts of uncertainty. 

4. TRUST MOVES IN LITTLE STEPS: rules or codes for an intervention must consider prior levels of trust. One of our interventions was a Tools Library (Herramienteca). The lending mechanism was based on trust: “people will return the tools because they benefit all of us”. However, when the “us” is nonexistent —i.e. when there is no prior group using the Tools Library—a lending &amp; returning mechanism that relies only on trust a priori is received with skepticism by local community organizers and people participating in it. When testing trust-based mechanisms in such interventions, it could be more useful to introduce them slowly and overtime, in order to first build an “us” where trust can be built. 

5. SUPPORTING A VISION INFORMED BY SOCIAL TIES AND A PURSUIT OF INSIGHTS ALONG WITH PARTNERS. Due to the complexity of community social ties and their fragility overtime, interventions designed to strengthen them, benefit from having local partners, not only with established strong local connections, but also with the vision to advance them as a supporting element to their mission. A focus on insights and learnings in the results framework of the collaboration contributes to the motivation, engagement and increased appropriation of stakeholders and partners, given that strong social ties may take longer to mature.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. The first bottleneck had to do with ongoing conditions affecting our government partner on the ground, PILARES.   On one hand, the pilots’ implementation coincided with an electoral ban due to Mexico’s elections. This limited PILARES, a community center, in terms of its public activities: we couldn’t conduct the planned physical interventions in the public space, nor generate audiovisual communication assets to invite people to participate (neither in the physical nor virtual interventions). Instead, we had to rely on one-on-one communication for inviting people via Whatsapp texts and conduct the physical interventions inside the PILARES courtyards. On the other hand, the staff of PILARES were key for the implementation of the local vaccination strategy, which limited their availability and involvement in the organization and implementation of the interventions unexpectedly.   The second bottleneck is related to COVID-19. In the first phase of the interventions, we had to suspend them because someone from the extended team of implementors tested positive to COVID-19. Immediately after that, the local government enacted tighter measures to reduce non-essential activities. Together with our local government partners, we decided to suspend the interventions, both the physical and the virtual ones. As government and UNDP, we couldn’t implement actions that enticed people to meet face to face —even if mobility in the areas of intervention didn’t decrease. The decision to operate on the no-risk side and suspend, instead of continuing with the implementation and establish mechanisms to manage risk, delayed our implementation. When we reactivated them, we established an ‘invitation only’ mechanism, instead of allowing local people to join spontaneously.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose these types of data because they provided us with highly contextual information that:

1.       Helped us shape the interventions, responding to the conditions and needs of each neighborhood.

-       Allowed us to understand the results of the interventions and the signs of change they yielded, which point towards how our theory of change could unfold if the interventions ran longer (once we transfer them to our counterparts).

-       Helped us identify areas of improvement for future iterations and obtain insights to shape strategy for promoting the adoption and transfer of the pilots in the grow stage.

The gap these data were addressing was specific knowledge of the communities we collaborated with.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The methods above contributed to understanding, connecting to, and strengthening existing social ties and including the community as part of the design and solution.  

Co-creation enabled us to design the interventions considering the needs, voices, and expectations of members of the community and stakeholders, including the PILARES personnel, resulting in relevant interventions to all, and overcome barriers like the constraints of COVID-19. 

Design sprints were key to enable a rapid response to the unfolding COVID-19 crisis and identify and overcome new barriers. 

Pilots allowed us to test the interventions that ensue from the design process and better understand how they helped us overcome the constraints of COVID-19.

Ethnography methods assessed the contributions of our pilots towards our learning question and inform recommendations for future improvement, including setting up WhatsApp groups that allow to sense other or evolving interactions. It also helped us identify the needs of PILARES and the expectations they have for the pilots, as well as the steps we should follow to facilitate their transfer and adoption.    

Looking towards future opportunities, these methodologies, also contributed to heighten social ties, not only inform the intervention, and facilitate adoption.

## Partners
****

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Codeando México assisted in the design and implementation of the digital platform. Their experience with civic tech and user interphase design was key to achieve a testable pilot that included the community’s participation.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Aldrich Lab – Daniel P. Aldrich (Northeastern University) and his team had advised the research on social capital indicators for Mexico City and in a preliminary phase, when setting up the collaboration with CGAAI, they participated in defining the approach with each community and exploring possible intervention ideas.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

MACIA Estudio collaborated in the design and implementation of the physical interventions.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The General Coordination of Advisors and International Affairs (CGAAI) of Mexico City was our initial partner within the city government and during the whole project. They also promoted and facilitated connections with other city institutions, including PILARES. Points of Innovation, Freedom, Art, Education and Knowledge (PILARES)- These local community centers are our partners on each polygon where we are working and a played a key role in fostering the connection to the communities.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

CGAAI – As advisors to the mayor and working on strategic projects for the city, their vision and ability to connect to multiple government institutions has been very relevant for the Lab’s focus on testing new approaches, systemic perspective and learning. PILARES – Already established with the community and working in the continuous process of improving its connection to the people in their surroundings, PILARES was key for communicating and summoning participants to the interventions. MACIA Estudio – including a partner from design background with participatory social and urban intervention experience contributed to communicate the concept of the intervention better and give it a distinct presence that is memorable. Codeando México – the civil society organization brought their experience with civic tech and user interphase design, which was key to achieve a testable pilot that included the community’s participation.
