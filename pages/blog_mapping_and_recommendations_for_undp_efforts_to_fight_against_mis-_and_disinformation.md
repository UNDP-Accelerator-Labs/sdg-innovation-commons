Abstract: This report is the culmination of six months' work by a team of five master’s students at

Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) and their faculty advisor.

The priority was to map the different interventions by the UNDP Accelerator Labs aiming to use

local solutions to tackle the problem of online mis- and disinformation in their own countries. The

report addresses the myriad of interventions and recommends greater coordination between the

UNDP Accelerator Labs to different entities within the United Nations.

Executive Summary

The rapid and pervasive spread of mis- and disinformation across the globe threatens to erode our

information ecosystems and disrupt progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). New

technologies like language processing models, AI-generated deepfakes and algorithms that spread

targeted disinformation have exacerbated an already urgent problem, and efforts to combat highly

sophisticated mis- and disinformation are slow to keep up. Importantly, mis- and disinformation

undermines good governance practices, disrupts confidence in full and fair elections and inhibits

the green transition. Failure to address mis- and disinformation threatens to undermine decades of

progress on the part of the United Nations and countless dedicated partners.

To this end, the SIPA Team was asked to construct a Portfolio of Solutions to address mis- and

disinformation in the Global South. The product of this report is 1) an assessment of knowledge

gaps in addressing mis- and disinformation, relative to the United Nations and UNDP, as well as

other institutions and organizations around the world; 2) a taxonomy of efforts to address mis- and

disinformation; 3) a Portfolio of Solutions that compiles innovative types of interventions to mis-

and disinformation which can be applied across social and cultural contexts; and 4)

recommendations to the United Nations and UNDP on next steps to address global mis- and

disinformation in a synchronized manner and to build strategic partnerships to facilitate those

recommendations.

To start, the Team identified four Knowledge Gaps within and outside the UN system. First, while

there is a wealth of focus on online interventions to address mis- and disinformation, there is less

attention paid to the ways that mis- and disinformation spreads offline and how to counteract it.

Second, while there are several initiatives within the United Nations system to address mis- and

disinformation, there is a need for more coordination to avoid redundancy at a national level. Third,

there is a lack of regulatory power in the Global South to implement many supply-side solutions

and hold digital platforms accountable for the content they display and promote. Fourth, the

misinformation ecosystem in the Global South is highly complex and involves sophisticated tools

like artificial intelligence, microtargeting algorithms and encrypted messaging services like

WhatsApp. This complex ecosystem is difficult to penetrate and requires similarly complex

responses.

3

Second, the Team categorized solutions for mis- and disinformation using Dr. Anya Schiffrin’s
proprietary taxonomy of solutions.1 It separates interventions by supply-side and demand-side
impacts. Put simply: demand-side solutions emphasize the role of the consumers and supply-side

solutions emphasize the suppliers of information. The supply-side solutions can be further broken

down into two parts: 1) suppressing poor quality/dangerous or illegal information and 2) creating

and/or promoting high quality information.

Third, the Team constructed a Portfolio of Solutions to address mis- and disinformation in the

Global South. This Portfolio is inspired by innovative interventions to mis- and disinformation found

both within the United Nations system and from external partners around the world.

Finally, this report includes recommendations on the role of the United Nations and UNDP in

combating mis- and disinformation in the Global South, as well as guidance for building effective

partnerships to address mis- and disinformation. The Team recommends that the United Nations

accompany efforts of Member States in the Global South to more effectively strengthen their

capacity to manage and counteract mis- and disinformation on digital platforms and to promote

healthier information ecosystems by coordinating the various UN Agencies and initiatives toward a

common goal. The Team’s recommendation to UNDP is to coordinate these efforts as the primary

points of contact in-country via UN Country Teams. Additionally, the UNDP Accelerator Labs should

continue to experiment with local and regional partners on novel interventions to mis- and

disinformation.

I. United Nations Capacity Analysis and Disclaimer

The SIPA Team acknowledges that the Solutions outlined here will require coordination and

collaboration between UNDP, Member State governments, local and regional governments, and

external partners as needed. Therefore, all of these recommendations are presented with the

assumption that they are to be implemented in locations where the United Nations and UNDP can

effectively collaborate with aforementioned stakeholders who have positively expressed interest in

addressing mis- and disinformation. In particular, when it comes to infringements on freedom of

expression and legitimate speech, and would only be supportive of inclusive, human rights-based

legislation developed with the participation of civil society, the media, the private sector, and is

representative of different demographic groups within the population. This Report does not

advocate for any intervention outside of UNDP’s mandate nor where intervention is requested by

Member States.

II. Background

In November 2022, the SIPA Team was asked by the UNDP to support and inform their current

portfolio of solutions tackling mis- and disinformation in the Global South. The SIPA Team was

tasked with looking at the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network to determine effective interventions as

well as conducting desk research to identify potential interventions that UNDP can add to their

portfolio. The SIPA Team began researching the 91 Accelerator Labs and scoping potential external

partners and experts.

The SIPA Team studied the public blog posts of all 91 Accelerator Labs to identify which Labs are

currently publishing details of their efforts on mis- and disinformation. The SIPA Team categorized

their findings and interviewed several experts in the field of mis- and disinformation.

UNDP & UNDP Accelerator Labs Network

The United Nations Development Programme is the United Nations’ leading agency in international

development. Operating in 170 countries and territories with more than 22,000 personnel, UNDP

works to build institutional capacities, develop policies, facilitate partnerships and reduce inequality
toward achieving the SDGs.2

Established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966, UNDP focuses on three areas:

sustainable development, democratic governance and peacebuilding, and climate and disaster
resilience.3 To accelerate progress on these focus areas and to achieve the SDGs in time, the UNDP
Accelerator Labs were established in 2019.4

Today, 91 UNDP Accelerator Labs operate in 115 countries as part of UNDP’s Country Offices. Each

Accelerator Lab consists of three team members — Head of Solutions Mapping, Head of

Experimentation and Head of Exploration — and taps into local innovations to create actionable
insights and reimagine sustainable development for the 21st century.5

What is Mis- and Disinformation?

In an age where information is more accessible than ever, people can easily stay tuned with the

rest of the world by listening to podcasts, scrolling through 30-second videos and reading news

digests from social media. An estimated 5.3 billion people, or 66 percent of the world’s population,

used the Internet to access information in 2022.6 Additionally, worldwide smartphone ownership
has surpassed 83.07 percent of the world’s population while nearly half of all households
worldwide have a computer.7

Such an influx of inexpensive and timely information has significantly improved digital life, but also

brought confusion, deception, chaos and violence. Despite mis- and disinformation being a root

cause for many of these pervasive problems, the exact definitions of mis- and disinformation have

not been agreed on. However, scholars have agreed that although both misinformation and

disinformation are inaccurate and detrimental, the former is not intentionally created to cause
harm, but the latter is.8

In a report published by the Council of Europe, researchers Wardle and Derakhshan define

misinformation as “information that is false, but not created to cause harm,” and disinformation as

“a rhetorical strategy that produces and disseminates false or misleading information in a
deliberate effort to confuse, influence, harm, mobilize or immobilize a target audience.”9 Similarly,
media historian and theorist Caroline Jack with the University of California San Diego sees

misinformation as “information whose inaccuracy is unintentional,” and disinformation as
“information that is deliberately false or misleading.”10 For example, misinformation could be

information reported in error, such as when the Chicago Daily Tribute called for a premature
presidential win for Dewey in 1948 based on inaccurate statistical predictions.11 On the other hand,
disinformation occurs in situations like when the previous Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte

intentionally spread rumors about his political opponents and the free press on Facebook and
Twitter.12 For this workshop, the SIPA Team adopts Wardle and Jack’s definitions, as they provide a

holistic view of mis- and disinformation’s (often unwanted) consequences.

Accordingly, mis- and disinformation encompasses various forms of information across various

media platforms. This includes, and is not limited to, videos or pictures fabricated by deepfakes, or

digitally altered synthetic media, depicting disturbing scenes on TikTok, unverified “scientific

research” with appalling conclusions from group chats, and politicians’ subjective opinions (or lies)

branded as truth on major broadcasting channels.13 Noticeably, among these platforms, social
media is becoming particularly infected with mis- and disinformation since the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially in the Global South.14 Despite some efforts in content moderation, mis- and

disinformation continues to become more widespread with the development of digital architecture

and algorithmic amplification. And as more audiences become unconscious consumers of mis- and

disinformation, they begin to doubt the legitimacy of science, question the necessity of
sustainability, and grow intolerant towards views differing from their own beliefs.15

Oslo Governance Centre: Information Integrity

Beginning in 2020, the Oslo Governance Centre (OGC) began working to combat information

pollution, particularly with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has since developed strategic

guidance to support access to reliable information and identified that information pollution is a
global problem which poses an “existential risk to humanity.”16 Their research extends across
topics including gendered disinformation in Ukraine and Moldova, the mapping of disinformation

in the European Countries and Independent States (ECIS) region, a Kenyan multi-stakeholder pilot

in the context of electoral processes, and in 2020, OGC launched an Information Pollution Mapping

Programme.

The Impacts of mis- and disinformation on the Global South

While the fabrication and impact of mis- and disinformation have effects globally, there are

particular characteristics in some countries. Without intending to generalize, we note that some

countries where UNDP operates have underdeveloped media literacy education programs and

displayed regional tensions over politics or racial/ethnic/religious divisions.

According to Reuters, in 2021, people in Africa and Latin America reported some of the highest

levels of concern about mis- and disinformation in the world, with more than 65 percent of these

regions’ respondents stating that they were concerned about what news is real and what news is

false on the Internet, compared to 63 percent of respondents in North America, 59 percent in Asia
and 54 percent in Europe.17

Among the countries surveyed, Kenya and Argentina are particularly notable. In Kenya, over half of

the sample indicated that they had come across false or misleading information about

health/COVID-19 (56 percent) or about politics (63 percent) in the week before the survey, one of

the highest among all countries surveyed.18 In Argentina, only 36 percent of the sample surveyed
found news credible, and even fewer respondents trusted well-known news brands. This is partly

due to the polarized nature of media coverage, and partly due to Argentina’s competitive media
industry wherein large, medium and small media groups all compete to win readership.19 Kenya
and Argentina are also currently notable for their political landscape, as Kenya held a presidential

election in August 2022 and Argentina’s general elections are in October 2023. While electoral

integrity is not the central focus of this report, both countries could provide valuable insights for
further research on the topic.

III. Methodology

The SIPA Team’s methodology consisted of 1) uncovering the underlying questions and objectives

as the scope of this work, 2) defining the key output concepts, and 3) employing three phases of

research methods to accomplish the first two.

3.1 Objectives

We sought to accomplish the following major objectives:

❖ Identify existing knowledge gaps in the Global South that inhibit action to address mis- and

disinformation

❖ Identify a taxonomy to categorize different solutions to address mis- and disinformation
❖ Construct a Portfolio of Solutions that compiles innovative types of interventions to mis-

and disinformation which can be applied across social and cultural contexts

❖ Provide recommendations on the role of the United Nations and UNDP in addressing mis-

and disinformation based on the knowledge and solution gaps identified.

❖ Outline a toolkit for building strategic partnerships in this space.

3.2 Key Output Concepts

The SIPA Team identified three output concepts to employ in identifying and categorizing a

Portfolio of Solutions:

3.2.1 Taxonomy: In the first phase of the work, the SIPA Team conducted desk research on

publications across the 91 UNDP Accelerator Labs and academic literature on mis- and

disinformation. This work was necessary to clearly visualize how the 91 Accelerator Labs are

addressing mis- and disinformation and if any of the Accelerator Labs have found unique

and innovative approaches, especially in the Global South. The output of this desk research,

informed by Dr. Anya Schiffrin’s research, was a taxonomy that categorizes and showcases

— going from broad to narrow — where each of the 91 Accelerator Labs contributes.

3.2.2 Ecosystem Mapping: Related to building a taxonomy, the SIPA Team created an

ecosystem map in the second phase of the work to visualize where the efforts of the 91

Accelerator Labs fit into the broader portfolio of the UNDP.

3.2.3 A Portfolio: To bolster existing United Nations efforts, the SIPA Team employed a

portfolio consisting of a toolkit of complementary recommendations and analyses of

knowledge and solutions gaps, to better address the global ecosystem of misinformation.

3.3 Research Methods & Tools

This report is based on:

3.3.1 Desk Research: Understanding the general milieu of mis- and disinformation and

relevant work from UNDP Accelerator Labs. The SIPA Team looked into the publications and

research from 91 Accelerator Labs, as well as academic literature on mis- and

disinformation. This also included reports and studies put forth by the following, among

others:

● Tech for Democracy: Promoting information integrity in elections20

elections/.

● Digital Public Goods Alliance21
● UNDP’s strategic guidance on Information Integrity: Forging a pathway to Truth,

Resilience and Trust22

The SIPA Team also consulted a comprehensive, internal Airtable with all existing

organizations categorized by the UNDP Oslo Governance Team.

3.3.2 Field research into UNDP/Accelerator Labs and day-to-day observations:

Understanding on-the-ground perspectives of remedies to mis- and disinformation for

social innovation, the SIPA Team was divided into two teams and traveled to Buenos Aires

and Nairobi to talk to both countries’ Accelerator Labs and local partners from the mis- and

disinformation ecosystem to understand the scope of this problem in their respective

country’s contexts. The complete list of interviews conducted in Buenos Aires and Nairobi

can be found in the Appendix.

3.3.3 Expert Interviews: Understanding contemporary trends in mis- and disinformation.

Over the course of this project, the SIPA Team interviewed academic and institutional

experts to better understand the scope of the problem. The complete list of interviews

conducted can be found in the Appendix.

IV. Research Insights & Substantive Gaps

The following substantive gaps represent the collective insights afforded by undertaking a

comprehensive literature review, speaking with SME experts and traveling to engage with country

experts. The first two can be categorized as “response gaps” that currently exist – this includes

disparities in solution offerings and structural impediments in streamlined programmatic efforts.

The latter two can be categorized as “environmental gaps” which include the current status quo of

regulatory power in the Global South and the increasing propensity of the mis- and disinformation

ecosystem.

4.1 Response Gap 1: Fewer Offline Solutions vs. Online Solutions

The SIPA Team examined a variety of solutions targeting global mis- and disinformation online.

While the solutions offered can help block the spread of information pollution, field research

uncovered gaps and a need for emphasis on offline solutions.

In conversations between the SIPA Team and country experts, the term “opinion leaders” was

introduced. Opinion leaders are people in small locales that are influential and trusted voices within

the community, such as political leaders, religious figures and other respected members.

https://www.undp.org/publications/information-integrity-forging-pathway-truth-resilience-and-trust.

11

Approaching these opinion leaders and “micro-credentialing” them, by offering training on

accurate information identification and general media literacy, is a potential avenue for tackling

mis- and disinformation that the SIPA Team’s research had identified as a current gap.

The SIPA Team also notes that radio is still a widely used source of news and information, especially

in smaller communities. In addition, many smaller radio stations are being broadcast in hyperlocal

languages, as opposed to widely spoken or national languages. This form of linguistic diversity

allows space for small-scale offline initiatives to be extremely effective in fighting the spread of mis-

and disinformation in places where larger online solutions may not be as impactful.

Finally, over one-third of the world population does not have access to the Internet, particularly in
the Global South.23 In rural and isolated communities, the lack of Internet connectivity has and can
result in significant information gaps. Without the ability to confirm or verify information, whether

heard over the radio or from local news and information sources, individuals risk not knowing if

they’re being exposed to mis- and disinformation and have limited access to digital literacy tools.

This digital divide means that solutions to mis- and disinformation which are effective in online

spaces will not reach a third of the world population. For this reason, we emphasize the need to

innovate in the offline information ecosystem.

4.2 Response Gap 2: Limited Coordination among United Nations Initiatives at a National Level

The problem of mis- and disinformation has amassed a global audience and there are several

United Nations initiatives working to combat the problem. Despite these global initiatives already

underway, in-country implementers communicated that they are not always made aware of the

strategies and objectives of other in-country players, which frustrates efforts and can be

duplicative. Country experts requested increased communication within the United Nations

ecosystem to better coordinate mis- and disinformation initiatives at a national level as it would

allow partners to support and contribute to solutions.

The following list is a collection of some of the initiatives within the UN system that have been

deployed to tackle mis- and disinformation. This list is by no means exhaustive and other initiatives

not discussed within this report should be similarly considered:

• Verified is an initiative of the United Nations in collaboration with the social
impact agency Purpose, that was launched in 2020 in response to the global
COVID-19 pandemic. Its mission is to promote and provide accurate, verified
information for people, with a focus on combating misinformation.

12

•

iVerify is UNDP’s automated fact-checking tool used to identify and prevent
the spread of false information. It provides national actors with a support
package that includes digital tools, capacity building modules, partnership
opportunities and communication and outreach strategies.

• UNESCO Global Conference Internet for Trust has a main objective of

developing a regulatory framework for digital platforms to secure information
as a public good through a multi-stakeholder approach. Prior to the
conference, UNESCO conducted a series of bilateral and collective
consultations to develop a draft of the regulatory framework. The final
framework was launched on World Press Freedom Day in May 2023.

• Code of Conduct on Information Integrity of Digital Platforms is an

initiative introduced in May 2022 in the Committee on Information by the
Department of Global Communications to draft a code of conduct to promote
integrity in public information while urging it to incorporate mainstream
multilingualism into its activities.

• Global Digital Compact was proposed by the Secretary-General in

September 2021 in the release of the report Our Common Agenda. The Digital
Compact seeks to outline shared principles for an open and free digital future
by addressing digital connectivity, application of human rights online, and
introducing accountability criteria for discrimination and misleading content.
It is set to be agreed upon at the Summit of the Future held in New York in
September 2024.

• Digital Public Goods Campaign is an initiative by the Office of the Secretary-
General’s Envoy on Technology to encourage and invest in digital public
goods. It seeks to build digital public good platforms to share data sets,
engage talent, promote robust human rights and governance frameworks,
and open-source software, artificial intelligence models and content.

• eMonitor+ is a UNDP platform that began in 2019 as part of UNDP Tunisia’s

electoral assistance project. It monitors digital media platforms using AI to
perform big data analysis in identifying misinformation, hate speech, violence
against women, electoral campaign violations, and political pluralization and
polarization.

4.3 Environmental Gap 1: Imbalanced Regulatory Power in the Global South

Country experts communicated that it’s important to consider the power imbalance at play

between countries in the Global South and large tech platforms. The majority of the Global South

13

does not have an equivalent of the European Union, which wields the market influence of 27

member states to effectively set global standards without needing to forcibly impose those

standards. While there are comparable federations of sovereign states like the African Union (AU),

the AU does not currently maintain the institutional force necessary to impose and enforce digital
platform regulation.24

Regulatory coalitions within the Global South such as the African Communication Regulation

Authorities Network (ACRAN) and the Mediterranean Network of Regulatory Authorities (MNRA)
have affirmed their commitment to developing coherent regulation systems across regions.25
However, there must be due consideration for the immense amount of resources that regulating

digital platforms will require and the multifaceted approaches that countries will undertake given

the varied historical, cultural and political histories of countries within the Global South. In addition,

there is also the risk that regulation intended to protect free and quality information could be

repurposed by bad actors to censor and curtail fundamental human rights.

4.4 Environmental Gap 2: Highly Sophisticated mis- and disinformation Ecosystem

The SIPA Team was also made aware of the highly sophisticated mis- and disinformation ecosystem

in the Global South that does not yet have equally sophisticated responses to mis- and

disinformation available. Particularly in Africa, sophisticated forms of mis- and disinformation — AI-

generated disinformation, deepfake photos and videos, and encrypted messaging services — are

heavily employed by those with strong political or economic interests in deceiving the public.

Across the Global South, political parties, fossil fuel companies and foreign powers — to name a

few — circulate highly sophisticated disinformation in locales that lack the institutional power or

built-up digital literacy to combat it.

mis- and disinformation circulated in hyperlocal languages presents another challenge. Digital

content platforms use advertisement-based business models, meaning that content moderation

efforts will occur in languages where showing ads to users earns the most profit. This means that

information circulating online in hyperlocal languages is unlikely to be monitored as closely for mis-

and disinformation or other harmful content compared to dominant languages due to the lack of
monetary incentives for platforms. Both “Facebook Files” whistleblower Frances Haugen26 and
TikTok content moderator whistleblower Gadear Ayed27 have discussed that digital content
platforms do not invest enough in moderating minority languages and it allows for mis- and

disinformation and harmful content to remain online.

The prevalence of encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp also makes mis- and disinformation

flows difficult to track, and there is currently little research conducted on the impact of WhatsApp

and other encrypted messaging services on the information ecosystem in the Global South. In the

book “Disinformation in the Global South,” the roles of WhatsApp user motivation and trust in
messaging group members were evaluated by a group of researchers.28 They found that group
trust was associated with a lower perceived risk of misinformation exposure and greater levels of

correcting others who pass misinformation along. While further research is needed, these results

demonstrate that informal social verification networks may help to break down the enigmatic mis-

and disinformation flows on WhatsApp. If left unaddressed, however, mis- and disinformation that

originates on WhatsApp and other platforms transitions to circulate via offline channels of

information like radio, local news and word-of-mouth.

V. Taxonomy

By Anya Schiffrin

The SIPA Team categorized proposed solutions for mis- and disinformation using a taxonomy of
solutions.29 There are many different approaches and proposals of how to address the problem,
but for an overall understanding of the different ideas about solutions, the economics terms

“supply side” and “demand side” provide a useful framework for understanding. Media scholar

Guy Berger, who was previously Director for Freedom of Expression and Media Development at

UNESCO, notes that the creation and dissemination of information lies on a continuum that

includes production, transmission, reception and reproduction, and many of the efforts aimed at
fixing the problem emphasize one part of the continuum over another.30 However, for simplicity’s
sake, solutions herein are categorized as demand-side solutions and supply-side solutions.

Demand-side solutions emphasize the role of the consumers, and include efforts to teach media

literacy, promote community engagement, and verification efforts such as labeling and fact-

checking. These solutions emphasize audience demand and the role of individual choice.

Supply-side solutions emphasize the supply of information and refer to controlling what

information is shown through algorithms and content moderation. The supply-side solutions can

be further broken down into two parts: 1) suppressing poor quality/dangerous or illegal

information and 2) creating and/or promoting high-quality information.

VI. Results: A Portfolio of Solutions to Address mis- and disinformation in the Global South

The SIPA Team has constructed a Portfolio of Solutions to compile innovative interventions to mis-

and disinformation from around the world. These solutions are categorized according to the above

taxonomy and include details of the environments in which they have been successfully

implemented and by whom. The solutions in this Portfolio come from a variety of contexts; they

have been chosen for their effectiveness across different types of mis- and disinformation on a

variety of subjects.

❖ Public-Private Partnerships

➢ UNDP Pakistan Accelerator Lab31 is partnering with a telehealth startup, the Ministry
of National Health Services, and local phone providers to replace dial tones with

quality public health information on COVID-19. It also directed patients to receive

health consultations, which resulted in more than 300,000 consultations being done.

❖ Guidelines for Regulating Digital Platforms

➢ The guidelines, currently in development by UNESCO,32 aim to support regulators,
governments, legislatures and companies to deal with content that potentially

damages human rights and democracy, while protecting freedom of expression and

the availability of accurate and reliable information.

❖ Global Digital Compact

➢ The Global Digital Compact33 is expected to “outline shared principles for an open,

free and secure digital future for all.” The Common Agenda report suggests topics it

might cover, including digital connectivity, avoiding Internet fragmentation,

providing people with options as to how their data is used, application of human

rights online, and promoting a trustworthy Internet by introducing accountability

criteria for discrimination and misleading content.

❖ Content Regulation

➢ Content regulation laws34 and regulations govern the content that can be published
online. These laws vary from country to country, but they generally aim to protect

people from harmful or offensive content. Some common examples of content

regulation laws include: Laws against hate speech, child sexual abuse materials,

copyright infringement and defamation. Germany and the European Union have

been leaders in this effort.
❖ Age Restrictions on Digital Media Platforms

➢ Age restrictions on digital media platforms are designed to protect children from

harmful or inappropriate content. These restrictions vary from platform to platform,

but they generally require users to be at least 13 years old in order to create an

account. It is easier to build consensus on regulating digital content from the

perspective of ensuring the safety of children. For example, protecting underaged
children is the basis for the UK’s Online Safety Bill.35

❖ Media Literacy Training

➢ Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate and create media in a critical

and informed way. It includes the ability to understand the nature of media

messages, the techniques used to create them and the ways in which they can

influence our thinking and behavior. Multiple UNDP Accelerator Labs including

Kenya, Togo, Morocco, South Africa, Argentina, Lebanon and Uruguay have and
continue to conduct successful workshops in literacy.36

❖ Gamified Media Literacy

➢ UNDP Accelerator Labs in India, Timor-Leste, Cabo Verde and Morocco developed or
adopted a pandemic-themed game37 to provide quality public health education. As
of January 2021, the two games reached more than 6 million young individuals.

➢ UNDP partnered with the Healthy Internet Project,38 a project incubated at TED that
provides a browser extension for users to flag harmful content. The tool has been

adopted in at least eight Accelerator Labs and is now available in English,

Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic and French.

❖ Paid Ad Campaigns

➢ UNDP Accelerator Lab in Kenya started a social media campaign under the title
“#SpreadInfoNotPanic.”39 The campaign was designed to engage the public to
tackle the infodemic and promote quality information.

❖ Automated Information Tracking

➢ UNDP Accelerator Labs in Tanzania and Uruguay partnered with AI companies to

monitor public sentiment on COVID-19 and/or COVID-19 vaccines40 on social media
to understand the scope of the infodemic.

❖ Advocacy

➢ Accelerator Labs in South Africa and Uruguay41 released several videos to educate
the public on mis- and disinformation and advocated for a better approach to

understand the harms it could cause.

❖ Business Challenges

➢ The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Cambodia engaged a group of local and international
journalists42 to remodel the business model of the press in Cambodia, in order to
make more media groups achieve sustainability in a competitive market.

iVerify

➢ An ongoing UNDP initiative43 that allows users to verify the accuracy of information

online through a web-based platform.

❖ Inoculation Strategies

➢ Inoculation Strategies identify the targets of mis- and disinformation and provide

them preemptively with quality information. Following the onset of the Russia-

Ukraine war in 2022, a “pre-bunking” strategy, developed in the 1960s by social

scientist William McGuire, was used to counter disinformation surrounding

Ukrainian migrants. Through a series of short videos introducing the type of false

claims and tactics that disinformation actors may manipulate them with, Central

and Eastern European individuals were warned in advance and able to defend
themselves against manipulation.44

❖ Hyperlocal Community Engagement

➢ Organizations such as KPCC Laist,45 a California-based newsgroup, engaged local
key opinion leaders to promote the distribution of trustworthy information by

building offline communities.

❖ Fund Grassroot Journalism

➢ Organizations such as Internews46 train journalists and digital rights activists, tackle

disinformation, and offer business expertise to help media outlets become

financially sustainable. They do this work in partnership with local communities.

❖ Centralized Content Moderation

➢ This solution emphasizes the need for a centralized moderating entity. While in

some cases a government can act in this capacity, the emphasis must be on the

autonomy and complete independence of the moderating entity and therefore does

not necessarily need to be state funded. Kenya is a prime example of state-funded

entities, as the Communications Authority of Kenya, Media Council of Kenya and

National Cohesion and Integration Commission share responsibilities for

centralizing these efforts.

❖ Fact Checking

➢ Organizations such as Africa Check,47 Chequeado,48 and PesaCheck49 verify the

accuracy of statements and claims. Fact-checkers like these typically examine claims

made in news articles, speeches, and other public statements. They also investigate

rumors and hoaxes in their efforts to mitigate mis- and disinformation.

VII. Recommendations

The following recommendations are made based on the insights identified by the SIPA Team

during their desk and field research into UNDP and the Accelerator Labs and are further informed

by expert interviews. These recommendations should be considered with respect to the limitations

outlined in the above “United Nations Capacity Analysis and Disclaimer” section.

United Nations

The key recommendation for the United Nations is to take steps to address gaps in Regulatory

Power in the Global South and United Nations’ Initiatives. First, the United Nations should

collaborate with Member State governments to support the implementation of UNESCO Guidelines

for Regulating Digital Platforms where appropriate and requested by Member States. Additionally,

it will be important for the United Nations to organize United Nations Agencies to coordinate their

efforts to support this implementation across their various mandates at both a national and local

level.

UNDP

UNDP should, where requested, facilitate on-the-ground support to address capacity gaps to

manage and counteract in the Global South. This will include supporting Member State

governments via UNDP Country Teams and should leverage its scope and influence to find and

engage local and regional partners. Finally, UNDP should continue to engage and emphasize its

commitment to coordinate with Member State governments who are seeking proactive and
sustained elections support.50

UNDP Accelerator Labs

Among the four response gaps identified in this report, the UNDP Accelerator Labs appear to be

best suited to contribute towards efforts to address gaps in Online vs. Offline Solutions and the

Highly Sophisticated misinformation Environment in the Global South. UNDP, through the

Accelerator Labs, should form thematic and long-term partnerships with strategic local and

regional allies and practitioners – the cornerstone of this strategy should be hyperlocal and focused

on deeper relationship building in microcosms of information flow (i.e., cities, villages, religious

communities, etc.). For a comprehensive list of potential partners for the Accelerator Labs to

strengthen local relationships with, please see the Appendix. In addition to building partnerships,

the Accelerator Labs should also keep testing interventions on novel forms of misinformation.

50 As per the above “United Nations Capacity Analysis and Disclaimer” section, UNDP may only engage in
electoral support when requested by Member States and mandated by the United Nations, and thus
support of related governance objectives could look like information integrity support outside of electoral
cycles.

24

VIII. Partnerships

There is an opportunity for UNDP to leverage partners in order to better implement

recommendations with the support and guidance of local expertise. The SIPA Team has identified

the following primary sectors where partnerships would be beneficial. A complete list of

recommended partners can be found in the Appendix.

Government Partners

Within the boundaries established by UNDP’s mandate, UNDP should work with and support

member state governments to address the “Substantive Gap 4.3 Imbalanced Regulatory Power”

mentioned above. The UNESCO Guidelines for Regulating Digital Platforms could be a helpful tool.

However, adapting the proposed regulation to the specific capabilities and structure of different

governments will be essential. Existing legislative entities may already be equipped to adopt

regulatory powers to curb mis- and disinformation and would lessen the burden of resources

required for building a new entity. Please review the above “United Nations Capacity Analysis and

Disclaimer” section outlining limitations to UNDP in working with government partners.

Community Partners

UNDP should look to address the “Substantive Gap 4.1 Fewer Online v Offline Solutions” mentioned

above by partnering with existing community organizations. Identifying and leveraging “opinion

leaders” will ensure that capacity-building and media literacy programs are designed to best

support the specific needs of a community. In addition, it will ensure that trust is being built

between UNDP and the target groups which encounter mis- and disinformation.

Private and Corporate Partners

Private and corporate partners will be best equipped to support UNDP in its effort to combat the

“Substantive Gap 4.4 Highly Sophisticated Information Ecosystems” mentioned above. These

partners are most likely to have the resources necessary to conduct rigorous research into

solutions for mis- and disinformation. In addition, UNDP should continue to engage with tech

platforms to promote robust company content moderation policies and encourage transparency

into the primary and outsourced efforts these companies deploy to stop the spread of mis- and

disinformation on their platforms.

IX. Conclusion

The Portfolio of Solutions presented herein is by no means comprehensive and should be

considered supplementary to existing solutions and initiatives undertaken by numerous

organizations — many of whose work supported the insights identified by the SIPA Team in this

Report. The spread of mis- and disinformation is a global problem and combating it will require a

concerted, international effort to engage in both demand-side and supply-side solutions.
