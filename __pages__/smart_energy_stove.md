Almost all electrified households in Zambia use resistive electric cookers for their cooking .This technology uses a lot of energy especially that there is a national electricity deficit and high domestic electricity tariffs. It offers opportunities to reduce electricity bills and save energy.

Smart energy stove is a smart, energy efficient and safe cooking technology that can significantly reduce households’ electricity bills and promote safety in homes. The stove heats up quickly when switched while showing no red heat signal on the cooking tile. The stove includes a sensor which detects when not in use and automatically switches off.
