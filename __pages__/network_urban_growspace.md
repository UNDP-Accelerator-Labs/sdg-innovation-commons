The innovation: Urban Grow House Network This is an expansion of an existing urban garden solution that can be utilized by persons in their space to produce food items for themselves and suppliers within their area. As food prices continually rise amidst the supply chain disruptions this solution not only produces affordable food in small urban spaces, it can also provide a revenue stream from excess yields that we can purchase and distribute to our network

From the insight gained from the existing model, the activity seems profitable and sustainable. The solution developer is seeking to refine the Grow Houses using locally sourced bamboo. Bamboo is an invasive species that grows quickly and requires no human tending. Bamboo’s fibrous stem is also strong and versatile.  The Grow Houses are tailored to the Caribbean climate and, even apart from the bamboo, the grow houses will be made out of locally sourced repurposed sustainable materials. Mr. Samlalsingh seeks to build a network of these Grow Houses and continually refine methodologies with the new data gained from the unique micro environments of every new site.

How the innovation started? This innovation began in 2015 so that we could produce healthy food on a consistent and easy basis for a household.  We utilized methods from different agricultural methods such as aquaponics and companion planting to build our own semi intensive system. It has changed over time from producing leafy greens, to seedlings, to vegetables.  We have been constantly rebuilding and refining the most efficient use of space and methodologies 

The Future? To make the operations more environmentally sustainable with regard to water management and to eliminate all non-renewable materials, such as plastics.  Mr. Samlalsingh seeks to develop a manual for the solution so that it can be shared regionally and with institutions such as the UNDP so that it can make a greater impact globally
