> Brief description of the innovation

Social Green Network is an innovative Social Enterprise committed to breaking the cycle of poverty in communities by connecting vulnerable individuals, volunteers and NGOs to philanthropic organizations through online platforms and networking events.
The Social Green Network was established against the background of volunteers and charities who work in vulnerable communities but their work is not known or has less impact because they lack resources.
However, through the Social Green Network, people from the largest organizations, to the smallest NGO will find it easy to find community projects to support – as such these organisations can access more funding, volunteers and expertise they require to execute community projects and therefore increase their impact in their local communities.
The Social Green Network has been designed to offers the following services:
▪	Fundraising – Conducting online and offline campaigns for Charities and organizations.
▪	Volunteering and Sponsorship packages for corporate organizations.
▪	Capacity Building in Social and Sustainable Business – Training, workshops, Online resources, Blogs and Vlogs.
Currently the Social Green Network website is under development and stakeholders are being reached through the social media handle @socialgreennetwork.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Social Green Network will charge an administration fee of 5% to 20% of the total funds raised through the platform. Furthermore, our Organisation will develop a database of charities in various sectors, volunteers, and philanthropic organizations which will be accessible on a subscription basis of K5000 per annum.
Our primary target market will be Charities and NGOs based in Zambia and deals directly with social and environmental issues. The majority of these organizations are found in Lusaka and in the Copperbelt provinces. The key organizations to be targeted are the ones involved in health, education, agriculture and water and sanitation. 
Winning the Challenge Prize will help the Social Green Network to grow by helping to resolve key challenges faced by the business such as recruiting skilled personnel such as an IT specialist, a communications specialist and a development specialist.
Sourcing funding has also been difficult, and this has been compounded by the cost of borrowing in Zambia which is quite high but with the Challenge Prize we can afford to rent an office space and expand our operations to other towns outside Lusaka.
The Social Green Network will also add value by providing capacity building programmes in Impact reporting.

> Technical Feasibility

The Social Green Network website will allow individuals, Charities, Business Organizations and Social Impact Investors running or supporting special projects in local communities to create profiles of their projects, post pictures and videos of their activities and expected impact of their projects and will also have access to the database to identify projects or volunteers to support. 
The Social Green Network prototype has been developed on WordPress website and it is supported with special buttons to take Donations and Social Media Sharing widgets.
The Social Green Network will operate from Lusaka. It will be a lean setup and only hire essential staff and the rest of the services will be outsourced until a time when it is deemed necessary to have full time staff. Most of the operations of the Social Green Network will happen on the platform and there will be need for business development. We will also develop strong due diligence mechanisms to ensure that the funds raised are used for the intended purpose as well as keep the NGOs that receive funds accountable. The other purpose of starting with community projects in Lusaka is that we can visit the projects and make assessments promptly at minimal cost.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Social Green Network is designed to bring together individuals, charities and organizations who champion community and environmental causes to increase their impact.
We make use of the internet – social media and the power of networking to connect likeminded people and organizations to improve the welfare of people in vulnerable communities.
The Social Green Network will also build a database of local volunteers and charities which will be accessible to organizations looking for volunteers and charities to work with in their CSR initiatives.
The capability of the Social Green Network platform to connect poor people to charities, Volunteers and philanthropic organizations will help in breaking the cycle of poverty in local communities of Zambia.
The Social Green Network belongs to the Third Sector of the economy; This sector plays a critical role in creating value worldwide, through its work in service delivery, advocacy, cultural programs, and social movements. The third sector includes different types of relief and welfare organizations, innovation organizations, public service organizations, economic development organizations, grassroots mobilization groups and advocacy groups.
Players in the third sector particularly NGOs are acknowledged to be critical to socioeconomic development in developing countries where government capacity and revenues are often very limited.
