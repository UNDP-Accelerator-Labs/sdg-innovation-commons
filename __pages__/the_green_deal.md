> Description of the solution

A UK government policy initiative that gave homeowners, landlords and tenants the opportunity to pay for energy efficient home improvements through the savings on their energy bills from 2012 to 2015. At the heart of the Green Deal was the rule that savings on bills would exceed the cost of the work. By meeting this 'Golden Rule', consumers were able to receive energy savings without direct cost. Consumers then paid back the cost of such improvements through the expected savings in their energy bills.

2. Academic research about its challenges: (1) Resident awareness and understanding of the Green Deal is low; (2) Green Deal assessment costs and loan interest rates are biggest barriers to uptake; (3) Number of use of Energy Company ObligaHon (ECO) installaHons over the same period; (4) Hidden costs: Rooted in fear, such as ‚Äòtrust‚Äô, hidden costs include the stress and inconvenience of construc'on mess (‚Äòhassle-factor‚Äô), fears that the work will be of poor quality and irreversible, and struggles to find a suitable installer.
