## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Solid waste management: A spatial mapping of the disposal sites in the capital
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to build a database and support the government in the existing data gap related to the solid waste management and provide a geographical mapping of the waste disposal sites in Nouakchott.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The solid waste management is a challenging and persisting issue in Mauritania. Many initiatives have been conducted to tackle this issue; however, the management of waste remains a key problem affecting the people's health and well-being, particularly, the most vulnerable groups.   This challenge is a direct consequence of the lack of necessary information and data as well as the behavior of the households when getting rid of the garbage. The accumulation of these factors transformed the challenge into a major problematic that requires an urgent intervention. The Lab through its previous cycle tackled the issue and documented an urgent need for information and data about the waste disposal sites.   The main actors involve are: - The Private company in charge of waste management (SMTD); - City Halls in Nouakchott, - Ministry on Environment   there is no treatment mechanism related to waste management in Mauritania. There is no sorting system at the collection process which makes it almost impossible to treat and recycle the waste. Furthermore, there is no clear mapping of the garbage bins which contributes to the erratic disposal of the waste by the household exacerbating its negative implications.   The undesirable effect resulting from this issue can be listed as follows: - Environmental consequences - Health consequences - Wellbeing - Opportunity cost related to the value chain can be created

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

According to GIZ BMZ and sweepnet report " PROFIL DU PAYS concernant la gestion des déchets solides : la situation en MAURITANIE" the average daily quantity of waste in Nouakchott is 0.56 kg/inhabitant with a minimum quantity of 0.35 kg/inhabitant and a maximum of 0.73 kg/inhabitant. High standing households produce more waste (0.58 kg/inhabitant/day), followed by medium standing households (0.52 kg/inhabitant/day), in addition the growth rate of the waste generation is around 6%. The data justifies the importance and the urgency of this challenge to be tackled by the AccLab.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Throughout our interviews with different partners, we noted the need to address the accumulation of waste sites across the city. The SMTD has a waste collection mechanism, however, the garbage bins seem not to be optimally placed which is evidenced by the household’s behavior when disposing of their waste.   The weak signal captured by the Lab is the urgent need for a structural change when it comes to waste collection process and consequently the need to identify and localize the waste sites across the city in a form of a database enabling a geographical mapping and thus optimal placement of the garbage bins by the SMTD. This would provide incentive to the household to adjust their behavior with respect to the nearest garbage bin.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value consists in providing the national partners with a reliable database that localizes the geographical distribution of the waste sites across the city and therefore enabling an optimal and informed decision-making process. moreover, this saves efforts and organizes the interventions aiming at tackling the issue effectively.

<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

- The ministry of environment - SMTD - city halls - private sectors (innovators (RIMCIOMPOST, SMARTrash)

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The collaboration is manifested through a detailed discussion with the government (& related) regarding the existing gaps in access to the data and leveraging innovative solutions, technology, and methods to address the waste challenge. These discussions have culminated in the organization of a workshop on waste management in the capital city where key partners will be brought together to take part of this event. The Acclab is expected to take the lead and organize groups discussed based on the future thinking, sensemaking, and collective intelligence about the strategic projection to address the problem. The lab will share its experience with a presentation of the constructed database and the spatial mapping waste disposal sites.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

- what is the current situation of the waste disposal process - what data/information currently available to inform the decision making - what are the existing gaps and how can the lab contribute to fill those gaps. - how to embark the involved actors on the challenge and what are the next steps for the scaling up.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

the sensemaking, collective intelligence, future thinking and so, will be used to collected relevant insights and information for a better engagement. The data visualization will facilitate the garbage bins placement in an optimal manner.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Our research and interview maintain that so far data on the waste disposal sites are poorly documented and there's no clear process through which data are merged and compiled. Not to mention that the data partially cover the city leaving many sites unattended. Our approach provides a comprehensive and innovative way to localize the waste sites across the city with spatial coordinates as well as information on the type of the waste, nature, category, etc.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The main benefiting partners are the government actors concerned by the thematic. The grow phase can do through the scaling up of this solution beyond the capital city.
