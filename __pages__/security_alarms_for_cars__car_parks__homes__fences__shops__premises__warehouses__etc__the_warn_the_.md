> Title of the innovation

Security Alarms for cars, car parks, homes, fences, shops, premises, warehouses, etc. The warn the owner or security personnel whenever a person enters a restricted area at an awkward time when the security alarm has been switched ON.

> Brief description of the innovation

Security alarms for cars, car parks, homes, fences, shops, premises, warehouses, etc. Their generic names are according to their modes of operations and detection range: BLOSEDE detects intruder once they enter a restricted zone, MOSEDE detects at 20m, COSEDE detects through contact with secured property/object. OBSEDE detects from 0-20 cm distance from the secured property. All alarms are user friendly because they need as small as 3v DC batteries, phone battery, solar power or 230v AC meaning they work the same way even in rural areas. They are locally available and are affordable at local currency. Any type of alarm once bought, there will be no need to pay any subscription, contribution or maintenance fees. All alarms paid for once and have no expiry date, they are meant to work forever provided the stipulated voltage is supplied. All alarms get triggered by the presence of human beings regardless of climate or weather, time of the day or duration. I will trade as:

I registered this company with PACRA and ZRA IN 2019 but till today I haven't managed to buy my own trading plot for outlet of finished products.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will continue ordering some of the raw materials from online stores, use them to manufacture finished products for local sales in Zambia at both retail &amp; wholesale and exports to other countries. It will assist in improving operations of both new and existing businesses by enhancing security and safety of their investments at the same time reducing or preventing theft, burglary, ritual killings even gassing which happened in Zambia. This means people will surely benefit from their investments without having the anxiety/doubts for possible burglary/theft. Market targets include all individuals, households, businesses, farmers, institutions, schools, clinics, organizations and companies which are security conscious for their life, property or investment. In rural areas very few clinics and schools have security guards despite those institutions having expensive property in them like computers, books, medicines, printers, etc. The government cannot manage to employ guards for all instructions hence the need to employ security alarms which play the roles of a physical security guard. These alarms cost K200-K400 once-off depending on type/size but the salary cost for GRZ security guard starts from K4300 upwards in private sector its K500 upwards x12months every year. The innovation will contribute employment creation, increased GDP &amp; exports, forex, local income to investors.

> Technical Feasibility

These alarms are meant to offer maximum possible security electronics by interfacing them with other electronic systems incase the intruder tempers with them eg, When switched ON the system will immediately report if there is a problem in its network. If still criminals temper/destroy sensors, the system will continuously report this vandalism till a defect is mended. Depending on customer requirements, these alarms are interfaced with cellphones in order to immediately inform the owner or security personnel/police for their intervention/action wherever they are in the world provided there is cellphone network. This provision allows the intervener to record the live events happening at their premises for possible evidence, investigations/prosecutions and follow-ups. IF there is no intervener for action, the customer can choose to connect this alarm with electronic weapon which takes lethal action against intruder tempering with restricted property/zone. After being triggered by the alarm, this weapon discharges 400,000v AC to incapacitate the intruders at these premises. No prototype exists for this project. Implementation plan includes ordering some of the raw materials from online stores, use them to manufacture finished products for local sales in Zambia at both retail &amp; wholesale and exports to other countries.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The alarms are meant to safeguard lives and safety of owners and property to avoid direct encounter with criminals by scaring away the intruders/criminals and alerting the owner, neighbors and security personnel/police for their intervention/action. There have been reports in Zambia whereby the watch man has been killed on duty, household members have been killed after a burglary, households have been gassed, etc. such cases can be reduced or prevented if an alarm warns them about the intrusion, "Ba Junky" or the intruders withdraw from such 'risk' home/premises. Business people will be investing whole heartedly. Both the rich and the poor will be sleeping safely and adequately. School and clinics wherever they are will have some level of security at the lowest once-off cost. The relevance of this innovation to the current is very high because it will one of its kind on Zambian market at such a cost with such functions.
