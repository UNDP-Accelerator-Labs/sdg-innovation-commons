Addressing the Leaky Pipeline in STEM through Gender Equality Integration in IT Company Management
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that there is a significant leaky pipeline phenomenon in promoting sustained women's participation in STEM fields in Serbia, characterized by high dropout rates and limited representation of women in leadership positions. 

As on of the potential solutions, we aim to develop and test a framework that integrates gender equality into IT company management to address these issues. This activity is part of a larger portfolio of learning activities regarding women in STEM in Serbia.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The leaky pipeline phenomenon refers to the dropout of women from STEM fields at various stages, despite a relatively high percentage of women in these fields initially. In Serbia, women constitute 47-52% of STEM graduates but only hold 10% of leadership positions and earn 23% less than their male counterparts. This issue is driven by factors such as limited negotiation for higher salaries, societal and cultural barriers, organizational biases, etc. The current situation hinders gender equality, economic growth, and innovation, leading to a significant gender gap and reduced utilization of available talent.

One potential solution involves developing and testing a framework to integrate gender equality into IT company management. This framework includes forming a gender equality body, regular measurement and communication of gender and family sensitivity, formulation and promotion of gender equality policies and action plans, and embedding gender-sensitive components into organizational goals. The idea is to test this solutoun in one mid-size city in Serbia.

Quantitative Evidence:

Women in Serbia make up 60% of STEM graduates but only 10% of leadership roles.

Women in STEM fields earn 23% less than men.

Only 7% of women negotiate for higher salaries compared to 57% of men.

Women hold 20% of management roles in the Serbian tech sector and earn 19% less than men in similar positions.

Gender equality in the Serbian ICT sector is improving faster than in the EU, with women's participation increasing by 14% annually over the past seven years, compared to 8% for men.
