## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The issue of improper waste management is such a big problem that no one stakeholder wants to tackle it structurally or be the first to take a step in the direction of fixing the problem permanently  We need to use system thinking to really take on the problems in a more holistic way  We grouped our learning into three themes or dimensions about the issue: institutional, territorial/spatial, and sociocultural  Low social capital makes community-municipal govt working together difficult and among each other  Urban inequality is normalized when govt services are underdelivered for marginalized communities

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

UNDP’s internal procurement rules  Acclabs’s limitations on how to use assigned funds  The COVID19 pandemic  Local partners’ institutional weaknesses

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Those were both relevant to our challenge and available. There is a data gap in desegregated household socioeconomic data specific to the project location. The last census was in 2010 and the next census to carry on was scheduled to be in 2020, due to the COVID-`19 pandemic, it was delayed. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Waste Management is a wicked problem in the DR. It has been neglected for decades and to really map and understand the issue and its ramifications, we needed as many data sources and insights as possible
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Makers community, we created, explored and prototyped ideas relative to the challenges in a Design Thinking workshop with the stakeholders

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

INTEC, we created, explored and prototyped ideas relative to the challenges in a Design Thinking workshop with the stakeholders

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Katharsis, innovation agency. We work with them to explore ideas, prototype, and prepared and carried on the workshop. ECORED, part of the Rescate Ozama platform

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Local Government of Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic Navy, Ministry of the Presidency, 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Makers Community to create, explore and prototype ideas.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Rescate Ozama Platform: is a multi-actor platform composed of the Ministry of the Presidency, the Embassy of Netherlands, and driven by UNDP. This platform aims efforts and integrates solutions to the problem of the pollution of the Ozama River and their communities. The Ocean Clean Up, is a non-profit organization developing and scaling technologies to rid the oceans of plastics. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Having different partners and methods allowed us to count on unusual data sources as not-so-salient stakeholders were able to join the conversation.  The innovation methods employed have also helped us frame the problem from a new perspective that appears to be more precise in identifying potential solutions.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
