> Description of the solution

The project was led by Prof. Chen Zongmao's research team at the Tea Research Institute. They created a green prevention and control technology system with the "soil solarization method" as the core and "feed attractant" and "black sticky trap" as supplementary. This system has been applied over one million hectares in the main Chinese chive growing areas, solving the harm of Chive gnats and the "poisonous Chinese chives" problem. Additionally, the content also shows pesticide residue differences between dry tea and tea infusion with specific data for substances like DDT, Endosulfan, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Dimethoate.
