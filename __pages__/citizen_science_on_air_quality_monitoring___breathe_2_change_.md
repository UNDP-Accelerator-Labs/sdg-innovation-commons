Overall goal: 

Collect data that reveal the causes of air pollution and explore solutions to reverse its consequences. 

Specific goals: 

Monitor the air, analyze the data collected, and drive the ideation and implementation of policies for change. 

Description of citizen participation: The activities carried out are directly related to the environmental issues of each particular area. The B2C Social Lab plans the geographic distribution of the sensor modules by first considering the communities most affected by biomass burning. Once the area has been identified, the citizens of the affected community adopt a sensor module that is installed in their neighborhoods for a period of 2 years. 

The stored data are integrated into an open-access, user-friendly dashboard intended to be accessible to any citizen wishing to check the air quality in a given area. For this purpose, real-time data from the modules are displayed on a map with a color-coded air quality index that is easy to read. 

Periodic workshops are also held collaboratively with citizens, students, and technical personnel from SEMA Tucumán (Secretary of State for the Environment, Tucumán) and researchers from INQUINOA-UNT (Institute of Chemistry of Northwest Argentina/National University of Tucumán) for the interpretation of the data. 

Time frame: 10/01/2020 - N/A. 

Project leaders: 

Rodrigo Gibilisco, Laboratory of Atmospheric Research of the Institute of Chemistry of Northwest Argentina, National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) 

Adrián Morrone, Neuer Weg Sensores (Argentina).
