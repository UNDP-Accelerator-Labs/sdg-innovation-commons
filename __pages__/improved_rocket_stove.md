> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Reduce wood usage for cooking. This version improves the efficiency of these stoves by using a plate that supports the firewood, and occupies 2/3 of the height at the entrance of the elbow. It serves to ensure that the air enters and is not covered by the firewood. Air itself is an insulator, also gravel, pumice stone, or ash. The square elbow is covered around it with gravel, so that the heat does not go and to support the insulation we put the body of the kitchen of brick or stone, or clay and sand. The pot is on top. It is covered with a metal strap for heat to travel across its surface before being lost.
