## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Academia as a space for collaborative Problem Solving
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is minimal  collaboration between innovators in academic institutions and the outside innovation ecosystem

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Commercialization occurs at the final stage of the innovation process funnel. It entails the process at which an innovative idea is transformed into a profitable commercial product also known as Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Recent studies in Tanzania indicate that several commercialization setbacks facing academic institutions may be potentially a result of several challenges. This includes universities’ ability to find resources in supporting the infrastructure and support for early stage (gap and proof of concept) funding for new inventions. In addition, it also involves poor understanding of the industrial environment, minimal knowledge about the dynamism of the market by most universities researchers and students, hence resulting in an inability to create market-fit products with less traction and minimal market penetration. The new role of the R&D Institutions as a key stakeholder and agent in digital innovation and regional development, especially growing digitalization, new societal demand, and economic challenges. Digital innovation in the era of industry 4.0 requires a new set of skills, thus HLI needs to evaluate their mechanism of producing graduates that supporting the unique properties of digital technologies in order to set up dynamic innovation scholars. As technology advances and the job market becomes more competitive, R&D Institutions have to quickly adapt to the change and commercialization of researches, Innovations and projects is the new normal. The need to find a proper path of commercialization is imminent.

In Tanzania, most innovative businesses in the academic sector struggle to grow and remain viable due to  failure to commercialize research outputs or innovation products. Recent studies indicate that academic institutions are struggling with commercialization due to a variety of issues, including universities' inability to acquire resources to support infrastructure and early-stage funding for new technologies. University researchers and students also have a hazy understanding of the industrial environment and a lack of awareness of the market's dynamism, making it difficult to develop market-fit products with little traction and market penetration.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

In a co-creation fashion with academic institutions that the lab has signed a partnership agreement with-   we are encouraging a  "challenge-based" model as a problem-solving approach to be adopted by innovation hubs inside the institutions. This approach enables university students to mix up with entrepreneurs, high school students, the private sector, and members of the non-profit sector to collaboratively re-imagine 21st century fast-paced challenges. In most cases, programme participants are selected through a meticulous online application system where selection criteria are pre-determined. Solutions crafted are designed to respond to opportunities and prospects as indicated in respective regional investment guides – a UNDP supported blueprint providing investment information to prospective local and foreign investors with the aim of attracting them to exploit investment potential in the region in order to stimulate business and enterprise development as well as execute development pathways. Very few donors agencies/non-profits are working in this space, however at UNDP level, a catalytic fund for innovation(FUNGUO) has been set up- this in collaboration with lab  will work to build a suitable/conducive environment for innovation in Tanzania. We anticipate that not only will enable/build capacities of local innovators but the intervention will support in 1) enhancing academia-industry nexus 2)  unlock third party financing 3) create jobs for newly graduates and also in the long run evidence generated from this project will enhance the policy framework and to capacitate and align the stakeholders in the Innovation Ecosystem in order to provide more effective services, provide more opportunities for collaboration, and to drive the adoption of innovation friendly policies, strategies and activities.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In the process of re-imagining the complexity of 21st-century fast-paced challenges, the UNDP Accelerator Lab is collaborating with Tanzanian universities to promote a "challenge-based" and collaborative problem-solving approach to help reach Agenda 2030 and the African Agenda 2063.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

In September 2020, UNDP Tanzania signed MOUs with the Nelson Mandela African Institution for Science and Technology (NM-AIST) and Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) through the Accelerator Lab programme.  Most of the technologies being incubated at NMAIST focus on up-scaling green technologies for climate change mitigation or adaptation, improved food and nutrition, data-driven solutions, and solutions related to information and communication technologies. MUST, on the other hand, houses a Centre for Innovation and Technology Transfer (CITT). CITT's role is to bring and manage innovation, technology, and entrepreneurial development in Tanzania as well as Entrepreneurship and Business Management. In line with MUST's vision, the centre aims to help MUST achieve excellence in its primary operations of training, research, and consulting to Tanzanians and the global community. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Accelerator Lab, the Dar es Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT) design studio decided in March 2020 to join hands with several techpreneurs in the innovation ecosystem to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The partnership included Bits & Bytes and Robotech (private sector), which were among the makers who collaborated with the studio at the time. In this endeavour, the AccLab worked with a ‘3D makers community' to design, fabricate, and distribute Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to frontline health workers around the country, notably those working in COVID-19 quarantine centres at the time. This was critical given the lack of medical supplies and specifically PPE for frontline health workers in Tanzania at the onset of the crisis. Our work on COVID19 has been featured in this blog published on Nest360 website.

Novel types of data are minimally used in the process of development planning in Tanzania. new businesses developed out of this collaboration are encouraged to use novel data in their businesses.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

As a growth strategy, we anticipate that this challenge will contribute to 1) promote dialogue, partnerships and collaboration in this space 2) Trigger early discussion around government innovation/innovation in government and how public labs/innovation spaces can contribute to public services delivery 3)promote or instigate ideas around spinning off the idea to creation of a public social innovation lab (similar to CITRA in sri lanka) at the moment only South Africa has a similar lab. Potential partners in this case are: 1) The commission for science and technology and 2) ministry of education, science and technology
