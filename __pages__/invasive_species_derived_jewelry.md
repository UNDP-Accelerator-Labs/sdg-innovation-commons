Invasive lionfish first entered Dominica in 2011. A local marine protected area and dive shop were granted the rights to hunt the invasive species which is consumed domestically. Additionally, jewelers have been created unique crafts and products out of the species that is known to takeover reefs and reduce biodiversity due to it having no predators if left unchecked. The jewelry is one solution to this species that was originally brought to America from the Indian and Pacific Oceans via aquarium trading.
