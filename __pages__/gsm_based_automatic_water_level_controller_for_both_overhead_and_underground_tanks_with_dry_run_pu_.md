> Brief description of the innovation

The  function of the system is to switch ON and OFF the pump automatically, the user can as well switch ON and OFF the pump using SMS on any type of mobile phone and also the system has the ability to send text messages to the user, informing the user on the status of the pump automatically, that is when water levels are equal to or less than 10% and when water levels are equal to or great than 90% the system should switch ON and or OFF respectively and should send texts message immediately to the user. The second important function is to check the availability of water in the underground tank. If the water level is below 10% the overhead pump is automatically switched OFF hence the dry run pump protection functionality and should send texts message immediately to the user. The second important function is to check the availability of water in the underground tank. If the water level is below 10% the overhead pump is automatically switched OFF hence the dry run pump protection functionality.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income from this project can only be generated through sales of the system, The need to monitor, control and conserve water cannot be emphasized. Automatic water level monitoring systems, came into existence because of errors associated with how humans manually operated the pumping systems. This is because it takes time for person who is manually operating the water pump to turn OFF the pumping system and this may cause water overflowing. Sometimes the operator may not know that there is no water in the underground tank or starting the pump whilst there is no water in the underground tank causing the pumper to overheat and sometimes heating to a point of damage.  The main motivation comes from wastage of clean water through spillages in households, factories and farms, who cannot fully control their water control systems and results in overuse of water, Overuse of water in homes also leaves less fresh water for use in agriculture. If plants cannot be watered due to shortages, crop yields are reduced and the food supply for humans and for livestock is threatened. The fresh water that is cleaned and delivered to homes and businesses is often taken from aquatic environments in which the plants and animals rely on the water to survive. If too much water is removed from these systems and not returned in equal quantities, species become endangered

> Technical Feasibility

my innovation uses ATmega328p IC which sits on Arduino uno as the heart beat of the system, it also uses magneto strictive level sensor, which transmits the level of water to the IC. it also uses the GSM module for communication between the system and user through SMS. Since the system uses 5 volts, relays are used to bridge between the system and larger power used by the pump. Liquid crystal display (LCD) is used to show both water levels of the tanks. the system is flexible, eg the magneto strictive level sensor can be replaced by ultrasonic sensor. the main source of coordination comes from the source code that is put in the ATmga328p integrated circuit which controls the whole system. On the top level of system implementation is the operator or user handling a mobile phone and presses a “1” to start the pump and presses a “0” to stop the pump. On the second level is the system responding to the text messages from the operator by switching the pump ON or OFF and texting back to the operator whether “pump on or pump off” according to the status of the pump. On the third level is where the system notifies the operator when water level is less than or equal to 10% that “water level is low and turning pump on” and when water level is greater than or equal to 90% and notifies the operator that “water level is full and turning pump off.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Water is one of the most essential natural resources for life to sustain. For human beings, water is important for their everyday basic needs. Even at our homes, we need water for a multitude of purposes other than just drinking. But water management is an ordeal that most of us are tired of doing daily. Many times, we are unable to switch off the water supply to our tank. It could be because we are engaged in some other work or have simply forgotten about it. Only when the tank overflows, it catches our attention and we rush to stop it. In this process, there is significant wastage of this precious resource which we need to spend so dearly. An automatic water level controller helps control this water wastage and keep it in check so that every time the water reaches beyond a certain level, the pump is switched off automatically.
