> Title of the innovation

Youth empowerment in Agriculture sector

> Brief description of the innovation

The government should give an opportunity to the youths who did and who did not do agriculture to practice it so that it can help the economy of our country zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will assist because when everyone (youths) are given an opportunity to practice agriculture by giving them small pieces of land, they will be doing on their own and then the number street kids will reduce, because they be able to generate their own money.

> Technical Feasibility

My plan is that since we have people who represent us in our communities, let them organise small group of youths and ask the government for a piece of land so that those are interested can go ahead.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This can improve the lives of others because, there is a day which states to say, if you give someone a fish he will eat it for a day but teach him how to fish and he will eat it for the rest of his life, what I mean is, when you give youth empowerment they will no longer be found in the street begging for money and theft will be reduced in the communities, because everyone will have money
