> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

It is predicted that bio-CNG can help Barbadians cut gas bills by 50%.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Availability of seaweed, manure and rum wastewater. Also requires a CNG kit installation process in cars.
