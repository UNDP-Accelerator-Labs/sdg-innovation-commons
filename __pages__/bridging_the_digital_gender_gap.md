In February 2021, Microsoft Airband partner New Sun Road (NSR) began implementing a gender-focused connectivity program in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. To address this lack of connectivity, NSR is using a USAID grant under the Microsoft Airband partnership to build ten Stellar Ixq-Saq'e Digital Community Centers in ten non-electrified rural communities in the region.
 
The digital literacy programme was recently launched in all ten communities, and the 22 lessons of the first course were successfully completed by 319 women and girls.
