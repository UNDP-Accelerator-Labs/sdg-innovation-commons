> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The concept detailed in this proposal presents a feasible asset in the form of a hydro power generation from the abandoned open pit mines on the copperbelt province of Zambia.
This concept presents several advantages in comparison with conventional hydroelectric power stations that depend on rain fed rivers, such as social acceptance and the larger number of potential sites. From a technical point of view, there is less construction work of a dam as the walls of a pit have already created one. Thus, the project will generate the much-needed electricity first for the rural entrepreneurs, which will lessen the burden of the energy deficit. Furthermore,the creation of this facility will create both direct and indirect jobs.

> Technical Feasibility

In line with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), The primary subject of the Project is realizing the power generation potential of the open pit mines there by providing sustainable investment and employment opportunities to Zambians.
♣	To develop and promote the culture and practice of lean and green thinking –a subject which ‘has emerged as an enabling concept for sustainable consumption and production. 
♣	To promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, Employment and Decent Work for All; 
♣	To contribute to the development of Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure;

> Anticipated Social Impact

Due to the existing, but unrealized potential of open pit mines in the area of water reservoirs, and already structured infrastructure of the mine walls, which provide state-of-the-art man made facilities, this concept information memorandum presents a multimillion dollar worth of wealth for the Zambian youth.
The project will also provide a benefit for the local community and an enduring productive economical use for land that was extensively disturbed by open-cut mining.
