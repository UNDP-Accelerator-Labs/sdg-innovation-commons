> Title of the innovation

Growing of broiler chickens for sale.

> Brief description of the innovation

Prices of broiler chickens have been hiked on the market, this has given me the motivation to use the experience gained from aunt whom I worked with hand in hand for over 3 years to bring to the market what could be an outstanding strategy from the other suppliers.
The demand for chicken consumption in my local butchery shops is high due to the high population, thus making the suppliers to increase the price of chickens, selling at k120/chicken.
The solution is to reduce the prices to k90/chicken, thus having a lot of customers on my side. The profit will be less, but the more customers I have, the more the demand, making my products sold at a fast rate, hence profit coming in faster due to the cheap price causing the high demand.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

250 - 300 chickens are ready for selling after 6 weeks, per annum we expect to sale 2, 030 chickens at most, to 2, 000 customers. Each chicken to grow the cost is k55, with a profit of k35 from each chicken sold, thus making a total profit of 71,050/year.
The market size estimated worth ranges between k55,000 – 65,000. Our targeted customers are the local supermarkets, butchery shops, restaurants, bars, hotels and households. With the business growing, the expected number of people to benefit from us is estimated to be 2,000 – 6,000.

> Technical Feasibility

The business has been running for 7 months. We have one hen house which is big enough to accommodate 250 – 300 broiler chickens which we look forward to increase the number in the near future. With the phrase, start small! Think Big;
We look forward to having at least 1 hen house in each of the 6 main cities on the Copperbelt province so as to expand our business and supply from our local community to other parts of the province, with about 800 chickens in one chicken coop, supplying to over 7 000 – 10 000 customers. With all the 6 chicken coops functional, we expect to have a profit of about K693, 000 per annum.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With all the chicken coops available youths will then be engaged as employees to run businesses in different areas where the hen houses will be available. Thus over a 100 people managing to provide for their families as there will be job creation.
