## Title

Enhancing Coordination in the Kenya Innovation Ecosystem through Mapping of Innovation Assets
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is;&nbsp; In Kenya, innovation assets are concentrated in urban areas, with many of the facilities and centers being run independently and without coordination. There is therefore a risk of duplication and saturation of focus on the efforts being applied as well as marginalization for innovators outside of urban cities. There is also limited distribution of hubs and resources in locations outside Nairobi. Innovation spaces are insufficiently differentiated and have sustainability challenges with their business models, limited funding, and entrepreneurship support as well as insufficient collaboration and coordination between stakeholders. The situation above prompted the mapping of the innovation ecosystem with a view to identify opportunities for collaboration, learning, and investment; and support the growth and development of local innovators across the country

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The coordination and governance of the Kenya innovation ecosystem is domiciled in three ministries: The Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) Innovation, Youth Affairs, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Trade, Industrialization and Enterprise Development.&nbsp;Kenya is amongst the few countries in Africa that has created a dedicated Agency, through the STI Act 2013, mandated to develop and manage the Kenya national innovation system-&nbsp; The Kenya National Innovation Agency. The Kenya National Innovation Agency was until 2022 domiciled under the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and as such lacked the resources and goodwill to drive the coordination of the ecosystem due to the overarching demands on the Ministry. The resultant effect is a vacuum in terms of responsibilities and capacities to address the emerging needs of innovators in the country such as; lack of infrastructure and facilities to support innovation development particularly outside of Nairobi, insufficient information and poor flow of information on available opportunities for funding, capacity building and investment, and lack of structure and oversight to ensure that the innovation centers available were meeting the needs and standards relevant to the innovators.&nbsp;

The picture below is an image of an innovator who has developed an electric powered helicopter toy using recycled local materials. However, the facilities to promote this kind of innovation are lacking in the country. Reasons given by the hub where this innovator was situated was the high cost of material required to scale and also the limited market responsiveness to such products. Fabrication labs in the country are few and many of them under resourced and yet, they have the potential to impact on unemployment and respond to community challenges. Most of the funding for innovation in Kenya unfortunately goes to a limited number of innovators and does not include innovators from marginalized communities, engaging in hardware solutions or addressing inclusion for example disability inclusion. This is why the mapping was critical, so as to provide empirical and visual evidence on the availability of innovation assets across the country and inform future investments in this area.&nbsp;

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The value proposition of the Acc Lab is to engage Acc lab methods such as stakeholder engagement and mapping to bring together intelligence, data, and information to have a better sense of the innovation landscape. The fact that Acc Lab is not aligned programmatically to a specific Government ministry suits it to engage with the different ministries involved in innovation.&nbsp; Having engaged in a number of innovation challenges, the acc lab was able to harness some of the emerging needs and challenges of innovators in the country and provide qualitative evidence to this work.&nbsp;

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDPKenya Acc Lab has conducted a mapping of the innovation landscape in Kenya identifying that out of 200 innovation centers in the country, 46% are in Nairobi County alone and that only 22% of innovation hubs are led by women.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we support the innovation ecosystem in Kenya better respond to the needs and realities of innovators in Kenya in an equitable way?&nbsp;

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We collected a wide array of data;&nbsp; 1. Comparative desktop research on the different innovation ecosystems that mirror the growth trajectory of Kenya 2. Qualitative sense-making with innovators who had taken part in our innovation challenges 3. Stakeholder engagement with Government ministries and partners within the ecosystem 4. Ecosystem mapping- qualitative and quantitive research methods

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data gap we observed is geographic identification, mapping and tagging of the location of the innovation centers. What we were able to do is identify legitimate centers and cluster them per county.&nbsp;https://www.acts-net.org/ai4d/&nbsp;
We were able to provide a historical and current perspective on the development of the innovation landscape which helps to situate and bring out the investments necessary to accelerate growth in the space. Infrastructure and capacity building featured very prominently as key areas of investment. The innovation centers are for the most part uncoordinated, unstructured and insufficiently capacitated to drive innovation growth in the country and that's an urgent area of intervention. From the sense making we conducted with innovators, we were able to understand how this context impacts on the quality and sustainability of their work.&nbsp;
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The grow phase for this challenge is a collaborative mapping of the innovation landscape with entries such as geolocation, available resources for innovators and an additional layer of marketing or presenting the innovations available per hub per location.&nbsp;
