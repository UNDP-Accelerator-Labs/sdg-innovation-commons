Community Hubs for Economic and Climate Resilience as a model: Enhancing Iraq's Sustainable Social Contract
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge lies in overcoming the environmental, social, and cultural barriers impeding sustainable development and community cohesion in Thi-Qar and Muthana governorates. This encompasses the need to empower youth, transition towards a green economy, and rebuild the social contract without adequate spaces for collaboration and innovation among agencies, citizens, and stakeholders.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The history of our challenge is deeply intertwined with Iraq's longstanding issues of corruption, political mistrust, and economic instability. The 2021 UNDP research illuminated how corruption, perceived as embedded within the political system, significantly hinders political participation and access to services, weaving through the social fabric of Iraq. This systemic corruption, coupled with the muhasasa system's unrepresentativeness and the consequent disillusionment with the electoral process, has eroded faith in political mechanisms, urging a shift towards issue-based politics. Gender disparities further complicate the scenario, with societal norms limiting women's participation despite their crucial insights into addressing corruption and improving service provision, security, and political fairness.

Moreover, the economic situation, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and an overreliance on oil revenues, lack of diversification in the economy, and public sector employment underscores the dire need for economic diversification and equitable opportunity distribution, particularly for the youth.

These challenges are driven by a complex interplay of factors including  corruption, ineffective political representation, gender inequities, declining personal security, economic deterioration, and a gap in civic understanding. Involved stakeholders encompass the government, citizens (with a notable emphasis on youth and women), and non-state actors, all navigating a landscape marked by a desire for change towards a more inclusive, transparent, and responsive governance and economic system.

The current situation manifests as increased social and economic inequality, diminished trust in state institutions, heightened insecurity, and obstacles to civic engagement and political participation. These challenges underscore the urgent need for creating Community Hubs in Thi-Qar or Muthana governorates as  safe spaces for collaboration on cultural, social, and environmental challenges. The hubs aim to engage youth, promote green economic transitions, and rejuvenate the social contract, striving for a vibrant, cohesive community actively contributing to a sustainable and resilient Iraq.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Iraq Accelerator Lab's unique value proposition in addressing the challenge of reimagining the social contract, with a focus on the Souq Al Shoyukh Climate Hub (SSCH), stems from its innovative ecosystem approach, which emphasizes partnerships, local engagement, and the strategic repurposing of government infrastructure for community resilience and empowerment.

Strategic Partnerships for Local Impact: By collaborating closely with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, private sector, and local NGO, the AccLab  leverages institutional support and community insights to ensure the SSCH is both relevant and responsive to the needs of Souq Al Shoyukh. This partnership model ensures that the initiative is rooted in local realities while benefitting from the expertise and resources of national bodies and civil society organizations.

Renovating Government Entities for Community Use: The decision to base the SSCH within a government-owned youth center represents a strategic use of existing infrastructure to foster community engagement and provide a physical space for innovation and collaboration. This approach not only optimizes resource use but also symbolizes a tangible commitment from the government to support community-led initiatives and climate action, reinforcing the social contract.

Empowering Youth and Local Communities: The Accelerator Lab's emphasis on youth engagement and community participation is vital in a context where empowering the next generation is key to sustainable development. By transforming a government youth center into a vibrant community hub, the Lab ensures that young people and community members are at the forefront of driving change, from climate action to economic diversification.

Facilitating Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration**: The Lab's role in convening diverse stakeholders — including government, civil society, academia, and the private sector — around the SSCH creates a platform for integrated solutions to emerge. This collaborative space not only addresses the multifaceted challenges of climate change and economic resilience but also models a participatory approach to governance and community development.

Driving Innovation with Local and Global Insights: Leveraging the global network of Accelerator Labs, the UNDP Iraq Lab brings both local and international best practices to the table. This exchange of knowledge and experience enriches the SSCH's initiatives, ensuring they are both grounded in local needs and informed by global innovations in climate resilience and community empowerment.

Promoting Environmental Sustainability: The UNDP Iraq Accelerator Lab places a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability in the development of the Souq Al Shoyukh Climate Hub (SSCH). By renovating a government youth center into an eco-friendly building, the initiative prioritizes green building practices such as energy efficiency, sustainable materials, and water conservation. This commitment not only demonstrates practical applications of environmental sustainability but also educates and inspires the community and stakeholders about the importance and feasibility of such practices in local development projects.

Supporting the Green Economy: In addition to its focus on eco-sustainability, the SSCH is designed to act as a catalyst for the green economy within the community. Through its programming, the hub encourages local businesses, entrepreneurs, and community members to engage in sustainable business practices, invest in renewable energy, and adopt environmental stewardship as a core part of their operations. This strategic orientation towards the green economy aims to create new employment opportunities, stimulate eco-friendly innovation, and align Souq Al Shoyukh's economic activities with global trends towards sustainability, offering a scalable model for economic diversification and resilience.
