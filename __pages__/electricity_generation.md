> Title of the innovation

Electricity generation

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation uses a 12v battery to generate 220v which can be used the whole day for a household only.
12v battery is used to rotate the motor which in turn rotates the alternator by belt and the alternator in turn produces 12v dc to charge the battery and supply the inventor which produces 220 to 240 alternating current much needed for electrical appliances in the house.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My potential customers are those in rural parts where there is no electricity. This innovation if well made to reality would help employ young people. 
As on the environment, it will help reduce carbon emissions which are from candles and other lighting systems using paraffin in most rural areas.
Those who can afford to buy fridges in rural areas will be able to do so and this would help them to preserve food staff in a pleasant manner.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovative uses the mechanism which is used in the car to generate electricity for all the appliances in the car. It is made up of an alternator, inventor, motor, a 12v battery and colling mechanism to cool the system. 
1. The battery powers a 12v motor which is connected to the alternator by belt, then when the motor rotates it also rotates the alternator which produces 12n current in one way direction. The current from the alternator provides power to charge the battery and also transmitte to the inventor which produces 220 to 240v alternating current. This current is channelled to a wiring system in the house. This can run all day without switching off unlike the solar which depends on sunlight.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the living conditions of those in rural areas where the government has failed to provide electricity. It will enable them to watch television, charge their mobile phones and or in short it will help provide lighting in poor communities of the country especially western province.
