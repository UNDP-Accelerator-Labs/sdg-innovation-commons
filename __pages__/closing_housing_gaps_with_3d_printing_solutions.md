## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

This challenge allowed the Lab and the CO to reflect on how much an innovative purchase can become a procurement challenge wihtin the office. It also helped us understand the opportunity gaps this innovative technologies could close for communities and current practices. Opportunities that could be lost if the purchase takes a long time and the production of the asset also takes time. A lot of insights in the process, not inself in the challenge we are trying to solve.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Recognizing the initial challenges with the acquisition process,  and the importance of local capacity building, the Lab is prioritizing a  phased transfer of knowledge and responsibilities to the Crisis Response

area, and how we designed the relation with the academic partner. This approach emphasizes practical, hands-on training,  collaborative research, and the development of locally relevant  construction techniques. The handover strategy incorporates improved communication and coordination mechanisms between UNDP internal teams  and external partners, mitigating previous delays and ensuring a clear  pathway for the project's continued progress and sustainable impact in  La Guajira. By emphasizing this locally driven, collaborative model,  the Acc Lab aims to ensure long-term success beyond the initial project  timeframe.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is no actual data of the results of uisng a innovative tool (3d soil based printer), with ancestral knowledge in construction, and co creation of habitable spaces could bring.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Using a soil based house printer in a indigenous community in Colombia, is not about only the construction itself. It mostly relies on how the communities will apropiate the technology, lear its use, understand how it offers them value, and learn to use it.
## Partners
****

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge. 


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the partner:

Wayuu Comunity. Indigenous

> What sector does your partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

Indigenous communities are allies and object of our projects to offer them value. If they are thought of co creators of the value offered, they can be considered as essential partners. The use of the machine and scalability of its use is proposed to be with them.

</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

Academia has been researching on soil based constructions, ancestral knowledge and have previously achieved interventions to the norm. Bringing them to the project allows us to accelerate vertical knowledge of architecture and engineering. This partner also aims to continue researching on soil constructions and the future of 3d printing for infrastructure.

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We still have several hypothesis that are being part of experimenting with the use of the soil based 3d printer. This project is going forward for 2024, with a couple of strategic shifts. We aim to co design a "durable solutions" portfolio with programatic areas.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.

This project will move forward to 2025 as part of a portfolio on "durable solutions".
