> Title of the innovation

Prediabetes management services

> Brief description of the innovation

Prediabetes means you have a higher than normal blood sugar level. It's not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes yet, but without lifestyle changes, adults and children with prediabetes are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
If you have prediabetes, the long-term damage of diabetes — especially to your heart, blood vessels and kidneys may already be starting. There's good news, however. Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes isn't inevitable

Prediabetes management services (PDMS) is a company that teaches people the dangers of prediabetes and how to avoid it. We do an awareness program on prediabetes and help people get more knowledge about it. This is a serious concern because  98% of people who are prediabetic do not know that they are prediabetic until it develop into diabetes.
We urge people to test for prediabetes and prevent diabetes.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

People will be checking their prediabetes condition at a cheap price with our organization. Prediabetes management services (PDMS) will be checking the Suger levels for diabetic people for a price, and we will be selling glucometers to diabetic patients for their daily blood monitoring.
The only sure way to know that you are not prediabetic is testing for prediabetes.
We are in partnership with the ministry of health and they are aware of our existence.
