## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn if using sensemaking to summarize academic literature we could understand what causes behavioral changes and learn how to measure them.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we use sensemaking, then we will be able to synthesize knowledge in the academic literature about what causes behavioral changes and how to measure them.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We reviewed academic literature to identify what causes behavioral changes, the values behind those changes and tools to make interventions.&nbsp;

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Academic Literature.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Sensemaking and literature review.&nbsp;

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 week.

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time to synthesize&nbsp; the information and access to academic literature.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven. The use of sensemaking let us summarize the knowledge in the academic literature about what causes behavioral changes and how to measure them.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We would recommend exploring sources other than academic literature, like interviews with behavior specialists.&nbsp;

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

1 week.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. The identified causes could lead projects, actions, decisions making aimed at circular economy for the environmental programmatic unit at UNDP office.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity.&nbsp;**

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Now we have an idea about what are the main potential causes behavioral changes. So that we can test hypothesis that identify the relevant drivers for circular economy behaviors.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Making sense about each cause more than just list it. Processing large volumes of texts quickly.&nbsp;

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All UNDP projects could benefit from incorporating some causes as a driver in behavioral change.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Institutions or those who need the tools promote a behavioral change.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

As we went through each new academic article, we iteratively updated the categories of drivers. Looking at coincidences, and splitting categories as needed.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

It is important to check additional sources, like official blogs, consulting specialist or any other source relevant to the topic.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. Causes of behavioral changes could be useful to lead any topic other than circular economy.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore have defined the challenge we are working on.&nbsp;

> What surprised you?

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There are many causes of
behavioral change and values behind every cause, it would be interesting to
make experiments based on each cause to have a better understanding and learn
what causes really work. In particular, the exploration of the literature
allowed us to make the case that behaviors are not only driven by rational
choices, but there are also societal factors that can be very influential, and
some behaviors are emotion or routine driven (not resulting from maximization
of utilities as traditionally explained).&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
