> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

One of the services of the firm is fabrication/repair of car bushing which requires hard pressing. Currently, the firm is using a Hydraulic Jack (improvised) to compress the car bushing and position it well.  It is actually made from a junk car tire rim, a hydraulic jack, and few metals for framing, welded together to create an improvised version of the desired equipment which will still at least meet the firm's existing job orders.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

Lack of appropriate equipment for machining and fabrications job orders

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

It is intended for users of various types of vehicles.

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

I have learned that even with junk parts and materials from previous job orders of the machine shop, an improvised equipment can be made to perform the same functions as that of the standard equipment.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

It can also be used to compress scrap metals in junk shops.

> Status of the Innovation

- completed / scaled / commercialized

> Signs of Change: Are there changes observed with the innovative intervention? (If YES, answer other and describe the sign of change)

- impact is apparent and observable
