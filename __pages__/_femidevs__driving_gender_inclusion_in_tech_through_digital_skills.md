## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) The key insight from this initiative was emphasising the transformational impact of that digital skills have towards accelerating livelihood opportunities, whether through formal employment or other entrepreneurship paths. Through FemiDevs, about 200 young women from rural areas of western Kenya gained practical front and back-end development skills over the course of 2022. Majority of the participants went on to gain successful entry level jobs in local SMEs, while others used the skills gained to scale their small businesses into the e-commerce space. A few ventured into the innovation space through hackathons and won challenge prize money to kickstart their startups based on their digitally supported innovation solutions.  2) This initiative highlighted the importance of investing in dedicated programmes that focussed on the particular groups that have been marginalised. The intentionality of having female-only cohorts enabled young women who felt shy about entering a male-dominated space to apply for the programme and provided a safe space for them to learn no matter their entry level skills. For some of the participants, this programme was the first time they were interacting with a computer so they needed to start with basic computer skills. 3) Because the programme was ran in successive cohorts over the course of a few months, we were able to amplify some of the alumna from earlier cohorts who acted as mentors to the others. This helped them to connect with someone from a similar background who had gone through the same programme and build their inner confidence in their respective tech journeys as they had role models they could relate to. A number of the participants who graduated mentioned that they were keen to continue growing by learning more advanced coding skills. 4) The impacts of the skills training reverberated beyond the female participants but to their families and social circles as well. Majority of them shared that they had been teaching their friends and siblings the same skills that they were learning through the programme as a way to give back to their community. A few participants who were young mothers shared how they were able to receive support from their husbands to participate in the programme, including finding alternative child care options so as not to disrupt learning, as they began to see the value of the training to the entire family. 5) Only 3% of the female participants were persons with disabilities despite efforts made to attract young women with disabilities during the call for applications stage. Moving forward, it's important to consider having similar dedicated programmes targeting PWDs to address disability inclusion, as well as connecting with partners who have more expertise on how to make the programme more inclusive and accessible.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Since this initiative was done through the Acc Lab partnering with an existing CO programme, there was reduced flexibility as we were operating within the UNDP project management boundaries.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

n/a

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

n/a
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Pillars Care Foundation and Border Hub are local NGOs we partnered with to provide the physical space for the training to happen, mobilise and coordinate the participants over the course of the project in Migori and Busia counties respectively.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Rongo University is a local university in Migori county that we partnered with to mobilise and coordinate the participants in the training programme 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Lake Hub is a leading tech hub in Western Kenya that provided technical contributions to the project by co-designing the programme, identifying local partners and trainers to support the training, and providing on-the-ground support on the monitoring and evaluation.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All the partners were new and unusual for the CO. For the NGOs, these are grassroots organisations that UNDP has not previously interacted with while for Lake Hub was a new partner as the CO did not previously interact much with players in the innovation ecosystem until the introduction of the Acc Lab in 2019.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNESCO - we partnered on a similar intervention in 2021 that focused on coding skills for young women in the coastal region of Kenya with an emphasis on mobile applications. This provided a basis for sensemaking and exploration into the challenge which fed into the design of the FemiDevs programme.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Typically, data and insights on this challenge have been collected at a high-level, country-wide scope but through this project we were able to focus on rural areas and zoom into 3 particular counties for more granular insights, which provides value to policy makers at sub-national level on how they may model these kinds of interventions to respond to the contexts of the participants.
