## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We are testing whether creating a touristic experience targeting a local plant called Al Ghada will help generate income for women in Al Disi and Wadi Rum. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we create a touristic experience targeting a local plant called Al Ghada, then it will support generating income for women in Al Disi and Wadi Rum.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1-   Prepare a time framework plan for implementing the Al Ghatha tourism program.

2-   Meet with the stakeholders and local communities

3-   Site visit and planning activities for Al Ghatha tourism program

4-   Test the touristic program and help create partnership opportunities for the Al Disi women's cooperative.

5-   Prepare and publish the learnings and recommendations 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

revenue amount / month of the CBO

Observations of the ecosystem restoration

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We did a desk review of the Al Ghada plant shrub. The plant plays a significant role in the lives of the local communities. We also have some data from previous UNDP projects and local community observations.
