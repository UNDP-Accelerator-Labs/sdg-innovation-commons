> Brief description of the innovation

I'd like to come up with a company that deals with. Bakings, it will be mainly a cake supplying company , alongside with other types of bakings. On other hand, be able to hire things like musical equipments for functions (weddings, meetings etc) and be able to offer landscaping services, decorations and catering services.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Due to the fact that people eat everyday, dealing with food would be one of the most successful businesses ideas one can ever come up with.
It can improve other business due to the fact that I'll have to buy or purchase ingredients from them. Let's talk about icing sugar, serophine, butter, milk, eggs to mention but a few. That means my business will also add great value as it will be done on a daily basis. 
 A Confectionery needs a place with lots of people, a busy place to be specific.

> Technical Feasibility

Well, it's all bottled up in bakings.. Talk about prototypes? Cakes of course!
My proposed implementation plan would be at least a month from now, due to the fact that businesses starts booming towards the festival season, the earlier, the better.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It would help others for the fact that starting a Confectionery business would create employment for other youths too, and at a later stage lessons or rather skill teaching can be introduced to help my fellow youths acquire them too, and even more or better.
