Experiment of Nature based solution:  Bio-control technology against Striga hermonthica or Akenchira
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

How might we use the local FOXY strains for bio-control in Ethiopia lowlands to reduce yield losses and crop failure in case of parasitic weed (Striga hermonthica or witchweed) that attacks cereal crops. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Agriculture is the largest contributor to the economies and livelihoods of Ethiopia with 41% and 80% contributions to the GDP and overall employment of the country (Matousa et al, 2013). In Ethiopia, crop production is dominated by smallholder farms that cultivate mainly cereals.  

Striga hermonthica (witchweed), known in Ethiopia as Akenchira in Amharic, is a parasitic weed that attacks cereal crops such as sorghum, millet, maize, and rice in Africa and significantly reduces yields. Striga can cause yield losses ranging from 20 to 80%, severely threatening the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Various mechanical and chemical measures including hand weeding, crop rotation, intercropping, fertilizers, and herbicides have been developed to control Striga. However, their adoption by farmers remains limited due to reasons including high costs and lack of awareness.   

Biocontrol has gained considerable attention in recent years as a promising supplement to other control methods, which is a nature-based solution. It involves using natural enemies like insects and fungal antagonists, instead of chemical pesticides, to control pests.    

The toothpick project has been one of the innovative products selected by the Cultiv@te project of Singapore center for innovation and technology and the UNDP Accelerator Lab to conduct a field test in sorghum and maize growing areas of smallholding farms. This innovation is a nature-based solution as opposed to chemical products applied to fight this weed that would have negative consequences on the environment and human health.

Ethiopian agriculture-based economy, takes considerable contributions from cereals such as maize and sorghum. A nature-based solution that is nature friendly and very affordable to the smallholding farmers will keep the target communities profitable. This initiative supplements the national development efforts for food security and self-food sufficiency. Striga hermonthica (witchweed), known in Ethiopia as Akenchira in Amharic, is a parasitic weed that attacks cereal crops such as sorghum, millet, maize and rice in Africa and significantly reduces yields. Striga can cause yield losses ranging from 20 to 80% , severely threatening the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

Biocontrol has gained considerable attention in recent years as a promising supplement to other control methods, which is a nature-based solution. It involves using natural enemies like insects and fungal antagonists, instead of chemical pesticides, to control pests.    

The toothpick project has been one of the innovative products selected by the Cultiv@te project of Singapore center for innovation and technology and the UNDP Accelerator Lab to conduct a field test in sorghum and maize growing areas of smallholding farms. This innovation is a nature-based solution as opposed to chemical products applied to fight this weed that would have negative consequences on the environment and human health. The Accelerator Lab had facilitated a knowledge transfer visit between the Ethiopian biotechnology institute (EBTi) and the Kenyan lab. The EBTi scientists have adopted the biological herbicide development protocol into Ethiopian context and the institute mentions, the application of this protocol is useful for a wide range of crops beyond sorghum and maize, which could be a game changer in the cereal production.  

Through Cultiv@te, UNDP aims to introduce FoxyT14 in Ethiopia. It has facilitated a research collaboration between the Toothpick Project and the Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute (EBTi) aimed at identifying Ethiopian local Foxy strains, field trials on different crops, and evaluating the efficacy of locally identified strains by comparing with commercially available strains. The project hopes to radically transform Striga control and management in Ethiopia using local FOXY strains for bio-control, leading to at least 20% increase in yields of cereal crops, and consequently, improved food security and livelihoods for Ethiopian smallholder farmers.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Ethiopian Biotechnology Institute and UNDP accelerator lab will conduct experimentation, evaluation and validation of isolated FOXY strain at laboratory and field condition will be the next step of the project. In parallel sample collection and Fusurim isolation will be continued from striga hot spot regions (Amahra and Oromia). The selected local FOXY strain and the appropriate methodology for preparation of fresh on-farm inoculum technology will be investigated. Upon the successful completion of the on-farm evaluation of the technology, it will be scaled up in the major striga-infested regions of Ethiopia. Accordingly, this technology will be trademarked and commercialized in Ethiopia.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Selected local Fusarium oxysporum isolates which show effective response from pot experiments will be evaluated in Striga artificially infested plots. Selected cereal crop seeds will be dressed with freshly prepared on-farm inoculum of selected Fusarium oxysporum isolates and planted in Striga infested (artificially) plots in Assosa Agriculture Research Center research station. Striga-free and Striga-infested fields receiving the standard Striga control treatment (fertilizers and herbicides) are to be included for comparison. On station evaluation is to be repeated at two different sites (Assosa and Pawi Agriculture Research Centers’ stations). The evaluation will be repeated for two cropping seasons. Finally, the appropriate methodology for preparation of fresh on-farm inoculum technology, its practical application will be evaluated as pilot study on farmers’ fields. Five to ten Striga- infested farms will be selected from each of three major Striga infested regions of the country (Benshangul, Oromia and Amhara regions). 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Increase in cereals production that accounted from the maize and sorghum is unknown, except estimations are done based on sample data from few geographic locations. Also what strains of biological organisms, which could be a host for the fungus that could affect the Striga weed, but not to the sorghum and maize is not yet known. Therefore, a field assessment and exploration is important to identify a such useful biological organisms. This innovative nature-based solution will help in identifying it.
