## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

“Youth Innovation for an Inclusive Transformation of Fresh Markets in the New Normal Era in Southern Border Provinces”  (in collaboration with Southern Thailand Social Innovation Platform and Youth Co: Lab)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

A “Local Fresh Market” is a place that connects the food system in many ways. It is a hub of food distribution and a real-time indicator for social cohesion, food security, and economic prosperity in society. It is a physical platform that connects producers and consumers and a place where everyone has been to and visits regularly, including youth. But when was the last time you went to a market? With the Covid situation, fresh markets have become at-risk places. Do youth still need a market to go to? How do we transform our local fresh markets to become responsive to a “new normal” way of life?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Nowadays, young people are on the front lines of the transformation of agriculture and food systems. They are coping with the effects of environmental and climate change, which are likely to accelerate and intensify during their lifetimes. These problems have been exacerbated by the social and economic impacts of COVID-19, which has put lives, jobs and livelihoods at risk and is having serious effects on both food supplies and demand worldwide. Already prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, young people were growing up in a world not on track to achieve the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to food security, a world where a third of the population is affected by at least one form of malnutrition. Global inequalities persist and grow, and there is increasing concern over the crisis of youth employment within and beyond agriculture and food systems, henceforth referred to simply as “food systems”. This fragility presents profound consequences for the realization of the human right to food, to employment, to a healthy environment and to overall well-being, not only for youth but for all generations. (HLPE. 2021. Promoting youth engagement and employment in agriculture and food systems. A report by the High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition of the Committee on World Food Security, Rome.) These problems are generally occurring all over the world and yet including at the local level in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand where ongoing armed conflict still emerge and affect to various problems such as inequality, youth unemployment, economic loss, and food security.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

With our concept of grassroots innovations, Accelerator Lab Thailand seeks to promote the development of solutions by local actors in three southern provinces. Local youth are empowered to develop their own social innovation initiatives and collaborate with local stakeholders including the local government, CSO, and experts to tackle the issues in their own communities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We'd like to learn what actions local youth believe they can take in partnership with other local stakeholders to solve food systems challenges in their neighborhoods.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

In three southern provinces, a youth social innovation challenge will be launched to engage local youth and multisectoral partners in identifying local ideas and empowering the young to develop and test their solutions. To gain insights on air pollution issues and potential solutions, the UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co: Lab will use a variety of innovative methodologies from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co: Lab, such as sense-making, grassroots innovations mapping, system thinking, co-creation, and experimentation. The Challenge will consist of 3-day training workshops for local youth, mentorship, a local pitching, experimentation period, sharing forum, and a final presentation session. Stakeholders will encourage a sense of ownership and localization process, including local government authorities, the commercial sector, academia and specialists, and local communities.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The youth innovation challenge will engage local youth, urging them to develop new ideas for solutions that work for their communities and moving them away from the belief that addressing food systems concerns is out of their reach. It will bring a bottom-up approach and a new generation's perspective to the issue of food systems.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Featured by local governments and stakeholders, we continue to work with local youth and communities to find local solutions to problems affecting Thailand at the national level.
