> Brief description of the innovation

China Window is a Zambian digital platform established to foster and grow Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in foreign trade. This is a business that is focused on helping Zambian Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited budget to land in China. It is well positioned to help the SMEs on their China Market entry strategy.
This business idea came to light after seeing the gap between SMEs and international trade export. According to the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), Zambian SMEs do not export to the Chinese market because of language barriers, lack of export permits and lack of knowledge of the complicated export procedures (ZDA, 2016).
Our approach therefore includes the use of a custom made digital strategy, consisting of a clever Social Media and Marketplace-trying to get the maximum out of a small budget.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target market are Chinese importers and Zambian exporters. The profits will be obtained by charging the exports and advertising I.e 
Average price of the service is $10 per tonnage exported on our E- marketing platform.
The price per service tender by the company on the market will be $10 and our projected sell of services to 1000 customers per year.
Our Market size ($10*1000) = $10 000
The challenge prize will assist the company link the Smes with the needed capital for start up. The main value addition to the environment is sustainability as it includes the social and economic aspects.

> Technical Feasibility

Our approach therefore includes the use of a custom made digital strategy, consisting of a clever Social Media and Marketplace-trying to get the maximum out of a small budget. To help Zambian SMEs market their products to the Chinese market and develop their business in China, the company aims to reach and communicate to Chinese consumers and promote the Zambian SMEs products in mainland China without SMEs traveling to China by:-
 Connecting Zambia’s SMEs to Chinese Buyers using Creative and Innovative E-commerce and marketing.
 Offer training to SMEs to market their products to the Chinese market.
 Market SMEs products to Chinese local Trade fairs and Expos.
 Open a physical office space to enable Chinese consumers to consult and place a demand to supply. The prototype mainly focuses on the beekeeping and honey extraction.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve the lives of SMEs as it will allow the export of agricultural and organic products thereby increasing their profits margin. The innovation is relevant to our current market because it will assist our country to tap into the China consumer market through the export market as opposed to the importation, hence Forstering economic partnerships and development.
