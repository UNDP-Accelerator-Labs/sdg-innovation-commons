Mapa19 is a technologically simple solution that connects people in need with potential donors or solvers. Through a map that geolocates both the needs and the help, users from anywhere can make a call for solidarity and connect with people ready to help.  A simple validation process filters the veracity of the information, allowing the aid to be carried out directly from citizen to citizen. In 2020, more than 6,000 families received financial aid (500,000 PEN transferred P2P) and other non-financial aid (as shelter or food) solving urgent needs during the pandemic.
