> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Amaranthus, or locally known as "kulitis" is basically regarded as backyard weed- endemic in the province and even in other places. It just grows anywhere, hence,it usually is uprooted or mowed. Despite its quite misunderstood identity, especially to those who know less or nothing about it, there is more to "kulitis" than what meets the eye.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

To some, especially to the elders, it is a potential source of food. It's tops/tips are harvested, and are prepared as one of the viands by means of sauteing. In the far flung areas, or to those who cannot always afford to buy themselves sumptuous foods, this edible backyard weed is more than enough to make through the day without an empty stomach.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

It is very beneficial for those who are living in far flung areas, as well as those who cannot always afford to buy food.

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

Even the grass or weeds that seem to be pestering around the backyard or our vacant lots, bring about the saving graces to every stomach.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

Various households, especially those of the financially challenged, as well as a supplement to nutrition needs.
