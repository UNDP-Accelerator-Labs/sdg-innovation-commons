> Title of the innovation

VILLAGE CHICKEN  AND EGG LAYING

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia is a country which which deserve to have food which is clean and natural for the sake of good health.
Village chickens and village egg production is my aim in order to provide natural chickens and eggs unlike the one medicated in order for them to grow.
If funded and implemented , it can increase food security within our country ,and provide export as the production increase in relation to the demand of the local market.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Layering of village chickens and eggs can generate income through the sales of the chickens and eggs. 
I intend to continue partnering with others and engaging the local people thereby providing jobs for the people.
Other products such as the remains of chicken can be used for fertilizer in other agricultural purposes. Those in the supply chain of the village chicken's feed can also be improved since we can provide market for them.

> Technical Feasibility

Village chickens and village egg layering is designed as follows in order to archive the goal of producing more and more in order to meet the demand of the local and regional market;
To have different centers in all the district in all the province of Zambia .
Each center is to have a minimum of 1000 eggs layering chicken , and partnering with a minimum of 30 people in each district for easy layering of village chickens not yet at the level of egg laying.
These centers are to be placed gradually after the main center is developed to a more productive center if funded .
Local people are to be partnered with in order to provide health keeping and jobs to the local people. 
What is needed is  a minimum of 100 village egg laying chickens, a shelter for both sleeping of chicken and for layering. Which is almost 30000.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With the partnering of my fellow local youth we can create some jobs for others . 
Not only this we can contribute to the development of the economy by reducing the imports done .
Village chickens are natural which are more health to eat that those of GMO or medicated ones in order for them to grow.
With the implemention of my projects, I believe it can grow and be able to provide for our demand which can reduce the cost as compared to imports which helps people to spend little and have a chance to save for something else
