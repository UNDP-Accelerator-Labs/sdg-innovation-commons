iNaturalist is a citizen science app that promotes the culture of observation, registration and dissemination of biodiversity, and promotes the National Biodiversity Database (BNDB). With this platform it will be possible to learn more about the life cycles, distribution and population dynamics of all the species that inhabit our country.

Any interested nature lover who wishes to learn more about Ecuador's biodiversity can participate using this citizen science tool, thus contributing to the strengthening of scientific research.
