> Brief description of the innovation

CMC poulters is a group of three; a graduate primary school teacher from Kitwe College of Education (KCE) awaiting to be employed and two fourth-year medical students from the Copperbelt University - Michael Chilufya Sata School of Medicine. It was initially designed to be a means of sustaining our academics but has slowly grown up into something bigger and in need of room for expansion. 
CMC poulters is currently running three chicken runs in three home based locations and due to lack of space needs room for expansion. A dormant family farm is available for use however, there's need to put up infrastructure, water and power source to run the business. The current shortage of chicks on the market has greatly affected our production and hence, there is need to purchase an incubator of at least 1000 egg capacity for  sustainability in it's production. 
Implementation and expansion of this innovation will provide employment opportunities to the locals ranging from chicken keeping, to selling as we cannot manage doing all the work by ourselves. We are hopeful that our dream to supplement quality chicken and eggs to the nation will not die in a nutshell but will be supported by all the well wishers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The funds made from the sales of our produce will enable us to earn enough income to sponsor ourselves as we continue to pursue our academics as well as await to be employed. Additionally, the funds will be used to pay our workers and all the involved expenses. A high population demands an urgent increase in the production of goods and services to meet the market demands. With the current shortage of chicken and eggs on the market, implementation of this innovation will thus, help supplement for the deficit.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in an ascending order of business plans, summing up to the parent business plan on which this innovation is based. 

1.  Keeping of broilers
2. Purchase of an incubator
3. Keeping of layers for egg production
4. Venturing into crop farming: using the animal fertilizer (manure) from the chicken, we plan to start vegetable and maize farming. 


Believing everything big starts small and being aware of the possible challenges to be encountered, it's reasonable to start with what is within our capacity. However, we are confident that though we start small, with the right conditions in place, our business will grow and stand out to meet the market demand.
With the challenge prize awarded to us, we are confident that we will be able to put in place all the necessary things among which are putting up infrastructure (Chicken runs) on the farm, installing water and power source and purchasing an incubator. We are hopeful that our dream is realized through this rare opportunity.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The funds raised from the sales will be used to pay the farm works (chicken keepers) and sales agents. Extra funds will be reinvented into the business to expand its production. Expansion of the business will mean more workers to be employed and thus, more beneficiaries.
Implementation of this innovation and its expansion will surely help in supplementing the deficit in the poultry market through its sustainable production of goods.
