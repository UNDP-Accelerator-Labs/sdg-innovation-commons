As a part of the global Serbia strategy, Serbia should explicitly encourage Diaspora Direct Investments (DDI), based on encouraging Serbian diasporic investment in home regions (through specific targeted investment vehicles). Present levels of DDI are not set to transform some of the key areas of interests (education, science, technology). Unlike standard foreign direct investment or the short-term consumption that remittances boost, DDI establishes a superstructure with significant reach into the target country. This is because emigrant investors are willing to share skills, technology, and intellectual property with their former homes. Diaspora direct investments go beyond financial gains to include strengthened cultural, geographic bonds between diaspora members and home countries. If well explored, Diaspora Direct Investments may serve as a catalyst for further investments and developing social networks globally. Finally, partnerships between Foreign Direct Investment and Diaspora Direct Investments should be part of a broader strategy of Serbia.
