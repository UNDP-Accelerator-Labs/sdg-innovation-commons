Kava farmers are now turning to solar UV driers to dry out their kava produce instead of using traditional methods of drying produce in the sun and on rooftops. The new solar technology will allow farmers to dry up to a tonne of kava a day, is user friendly, will save time, and improve the quality of kava. It is more convenient as it is not prone to changes in weather, in comparison to traditional drying methods that require farmers to quickly cover kava produce when it rains. The new process will also require less laborers.
