Description: In this method, the plants are found in a sheet or raft – usually made of duroport – that floats on top of the nutrient solution, so that their roots are immersed within the solution. An air pump provides the roots with the oxygen necessary for their optimal development.   

Interesting features: Only one water base is used for all plants. The nutrient solution is regulated directly in the water tank.
