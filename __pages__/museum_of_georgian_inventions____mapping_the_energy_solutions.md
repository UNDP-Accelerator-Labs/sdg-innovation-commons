## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Museum of Georgian Inventions  - Mapping the energy solutions 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is to identify the grassroots solutions targeting the energy sector, including sustainable energy and innovative financing to create the access to the energy. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

UNDP's strategic plan outlines the commitment to creating access to sustainable energy for 500+ million people across the globe. to support the process, AccLab Georgia within the frames of the Museum of Georgian inventions intends to develop a call for solutions to gather the inventions related to the energy sector, including innovative financing for energy access and energy consumption.  Additionally, Georgia is dependent on Russian energy, with up to 60%, therefore identification of potential sustainable energy resources within the country can contribute to the energy independence of Georgia. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Labs mandate to map the solutions created the opportunity for the process to map the energy solutions within the country. additionally, through this initiate Lab can contribute to the global effort as well as the CO EE portfolio. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

#MuseumofGeorgianInventions is looking for the solutions which creates the access to the sustainable energy.UNDPAccLabs aims to accelerate the process of providing access to the clean energy for 500 million people globally. share your inventions on this link.
