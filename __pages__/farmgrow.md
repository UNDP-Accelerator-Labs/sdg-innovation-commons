> Title of the Solution

FarmGrow

> Description of the solution

The FarmGrow app is used to record soil properties (i.e., soil physical condition, organic matter condition, pH, and drainage) and related soil management observations (i.e. fertilizer application and formulation) from the top 30 cm of the soil at each farm site. The aim is to provide site-specific soil information that smallholder cocoa farmers can use to improve soil health and overall farm productivity.
