> Title of the innovation

Pa Market

> Brief description of the innovation

Pa Market is a platform that makes the trade of agricultural-based goods and services easier. The platform will be a forum for farmers to connect and interact with other farmers and customers. It will be a large market for farmers to sell their produce. It will also allow for direct interaction with freelance logistics/transport providers for the delivery of goods purchased on the platform. It will mainly be accessible through a website, application and USSB codes.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

For our farmers, they will create an income from selling their produce on the platform and logistic service providers will create income by delivering goods purchased on the platform and customers. We will gain revenue by charging a commission on sales and deliveries conducted on the platform. We will also run advertisements as another source of revenue. 

We will partner with banks, mobile money services, farmer cooperatives and insurance companies, giving our partners more customers for the services they render while improving or monetary transaction services, increase the number of farmers on the platform and protecting on goods being delivered. 

Our primary stakeholders are consumers, logistic service providers and farmers. 

The money will be used to host the website online, purchasing initial equipment such as office equipment and partner engagement meetings. It will also go into advertisement and hosting of events to launch the platform to the public.

> Technical Feasibility

The platform has three methods of accessibility hence allowing users to select the easiest way they feel to use the platform. These being a website, application and USSB codes, allowing for the use of the platform by the younger and older generations with little need of technical knowledge. Its simplified interface allows for the easy use of the application.

The applications and the website being are currently being built but we do have the final prototype of the platform. While the USSD codes will be created after the creation of the application and website. The applications will be three independent apps being the customer's app, farmers app and the driver's app. 

We will be based in Lusaka and target to implement the Pa-Market platform to farmers and Consumers in Lusaka, Copperbelt, Luapula and Central Provinces. The 4 provinces have been chosen because of the large numbers of farmers found in the provinces but also the proximity to each other makes mobility easier. We will then gradually spread countrywide. 

Pa Market will be marketed using online social media platforms and the avenues such as creating a page, attending Agriculturally based conferences and business to business meetings with like-minded organizations. 

We will partner with different partners. For example, we will partner with the banks and mobile companies for payments; Insurance companies for insurance coverage of the goods in transit and Cooperatives for on-field training to farmers as well as provision of quality checks for the goods before delivery.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will create a large market for farmers to sell their produce. 

Customers from across the country will then be able to access and purchase any kind of agricultural goods/produce through an online payment system that can use mobile money or bank debit/credit cards.

Access to logistics and transportation will enable the delivery of these goods to any customer’s location. 

The timing of introducing our system is opportune as it will provide the much-needed efficiency in the Agricultural marketing system in our country. We will provide a comprehensive marketing system that will ensure farm to table services. This service will allow customers to get the farm produce easily especially with the COVID-19 travel restrictions.
