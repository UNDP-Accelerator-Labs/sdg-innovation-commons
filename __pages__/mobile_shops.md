Trucks carrying goods from urban area act as mobile shop to indigenous communities who live in rural and remote area. This was especially crucial during MCO when supply chain and logistics were cut off. While some urbanites may think that the Orang Asli live solely off their lands & forests, the reality is that many are also dependent on such mobile shops in lorries & cars that come daily or every other day to villages in rural & even interior areas. These mobile shops sell mainly provisions, dry goods, snacks, hardy vegetables plus fresh & dried fish - and occasionally chicken offal & parts. The proprietor is often well-known to villages as they ply their trade for many years. Some even provide a line of credit to those they trust.
