**The hashtag #QuartierVertChallenge was created by a Senegalese citizen who decided to sweep his neighborhood, embellish it with flowers and trees, and share digital content on social networks to raise awareness and encourage people to follow his example.**
## Summary
**The hashtag #QuartierVertChallenge was born from a citizen who decided to sweep his neighborhood, embellish it with flowers, and trees, and share his images on social networks to raise awareness and encourage people to follow his example.**
## Description
**Waste management, sanitation, and tree preservation present structural challenges, mainly due to a lack of environmental education and access to basic infrastructure. #QuartierVertChallenge appeals to citizens' engagement to transform their environment, manage waste properly, reforest, and adopt eco-responsible behavior. The solution focuses particularly on youth civic engagement. **
