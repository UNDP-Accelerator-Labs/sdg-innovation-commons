> Brief description of the innovation

Imaginary art store will take the pain off an artist's shoulders when they have to sell their work or a collector, when they want to let go of some of their collection. Artists with the help of our website and mobile apps, will be able to allocate all their time to what they do best, Create.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

(INCOME GENERATION) - On all works sold, we charge a nominal seller's commission as a percentage of the sale price. This means the artist won't be required to pay any upfront costs such as Storage, Packaging, Insurance or Shipping to the buyers address.  

(TARGET MARKET) - Our target market are artists that are fade up with the selling process of their works, these are artists that want to focus more on creation. 

(OFFTAKERS) - Because artists have to give us the artwork for storage, it will be a challenge earning their trust at the launch, a good marketing budget will help break the ice.

(FUNDING) - The startup is currently in its angel funding stage. The prize money would help with registering as a limited liability company in the United States of America and Zambia, this will help us take advantage of the best payment gateways available. This will also help in giving artists around the world confidence in our platform. The money left over will be used in helping us accrue our first 100 customers.

> Technical Feasibility

Our platform is designed to help the artist do as little work as possible in the selling process, with this said, our platform will allow artists to attach a video to their profile and to the art piece so they can take the buyer through the thought process of the creation. 

At launch our primary focus will be advertising through Instagram ads, most of the artists we have had dialogue use Instagram to find customers for their works. This will be our strategy of accruing the first 100 customers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The global art market value was 50 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 dropping by 14 billon from 2019. Meanwhile, the volume of global art sales reached 31 million transactions, down from 40 million the previous year. With this, it is evident that the pandemic took its best shoot at the auction houses. More people have chosen to use their devices to BUY, even though the restrictions are being relaxed. ​

Our platform fits right in to this space, with Augmented reality technology, Door step delivery and Next day shipping, fusing ease and convenience for both the artist and the buyer.​
