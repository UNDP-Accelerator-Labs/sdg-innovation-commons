## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Learning to implement environmental public policy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that society and public institutions don't collaborate to increase of resilience to climate change

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The lack of capacity for society and public institutions to collaborate to increase resilience to climate change is a particular expression of the difficulty to act collectively to solve development problems. One of the main drivers is lack of interpersonal trust and lack of trust in public institutions, which hinders dialogue and thus the capacity to work together. Also, there are challenges in the quality of political representation, civil service, and state resources that limit the capacity to reach agreements in general (but particularly to increase resilience to climate change), technical capacity to implement those agreements, or fund those agreements if ever reached. Actors at all levels of society are involved. From the bottom up, some of the most relevant actors involved are: individuals, households, communities, private sector (both formal and informal), civil society organizations, local governments, ministry of environment (MARN), government agency to assess risk (CONRED), government agency for climate (INSIVUMEH), among others.

LAPOP (2019): 66% of people consider that someone in their immediate family is likely to die o be seriously injured in a natural disaster, such as floods, earthquake or hurricane in the next 25 years.  LAPOP (2019): 54% of people consider that people in their communities are not very trustworthy or untrustworthy.  LAPOP (2019): There is little trust in public institutions. The public institution with most trust are local governments with 38%. This makes difficult implementing public policy. LAPOP (2019): 88% of people consider that the government should ask indigenous communities before implementing policies; which creates a requirement to collaborate with society.  AccLab Guatemala using Census data (2021): 55% of households in rural areas do not have access to trash collection.  AccLab Guatemala using Census data (2021): Households without access to trash collection have a 60% probability of also not having running water within the household.  INSIVUMEH (2018): after 1990, each year has registered abnormal temperature increases between 0.2 and 1.0 degrees Celsius. The number of cold events is reducing. The number of rain dais are decreasing but with more intensity, increasing floods and decreasing availability of water.

There are increased expressions of anger and protest from society regarding government decisions on the use of natural resources.  There is lack of availability of water in some areas of the country.  There are new decrees and other public policies in response to climate change being approved and in the making.  Implementing environmental policies tends to add costs to local governments and individuals.  Implementing environmental policies tends to require changes in culture and practices  There are increased efforts in the international community for countries to comply with new regulations

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Colaboración between society and public institutions to increase climate change is a complex problem. It has multiple interrelated causes that change quickly. Therefore, the methodologies of the Accelerator Lab are better equipped than traditional alternatives to learn what can work or not to achieve such collaboration to increase resilience. Also, there is lack of existing knowledge on what works and doesn't, and other actors within UNDP tend to implement projects with a pre-defined understanding of what works. Certainly, the Accelerator Lab would not be able to work alone in this topic, but it's in a better position than other to connect actors that would otherwise not collaborate; such as informal sectors and public institutions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our learning question for this challenge is: how to implement environmental public policy?  We need to know and understand the barriers to the implementation of public policy, in particular when they are not popular (there is resistance from people) and transfer costs for its implementation to the regulated subjects (people, local governments, businesses, among others). 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Solution mapping will be used to identify ways that have worked to implement environmental public policies that required overcoming resistance and increased costs. Also, co-creation will be used to develop proposals to implement environmental public policies. Sensemaking will be used to understand the information explored. Proof of concept, as well as behavioral insights, will be used to test proposals and other hypothesis on how to implement environmental public policy. And behavioral insights will be used to 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Open data and literature review will address gaps in learning from already existing knowledge. Focus group, surveys, and spatiotemporal data will address gaps regarding the opinions, attitudes, behaviors and location to better understand the implementation of environmental public policy. Social media data will help understand opportunities for narratives to implement environmental public policies. Ethnographic data will help identify what are the barriers to implement environmental public policy and what are some ways to overcome those barriers. Citizen-generated data will complement ethnographic data. And observation will be used to test potential solutions. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This project will benefit public institutions seeking to implement environmental public policy. Also it will benefit local government who need to invest resources in implementing them and manage citizens expectations. It will also help actors in society in looking for ways to voice their needs and increase the benefit of their contributions.
