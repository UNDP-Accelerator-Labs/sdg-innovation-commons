The innovation "Blok Batik Boleh Ubah 'Pointillisme', or flexible Pointillist Batik block is an introduction to a new method of making batik blocks to conserve and sustain the batik heritage in Malaysia. The product is flexible and is capable of creating multiple batik patterns or designs based on single block use. 
Specifications
It uses the basic batik concept of 'Point'. The nail arrangements on the block are changeable to create different point-based designs. To create the batik print, the batik maker will only need to insert the metal plate according to the desired designs using the same batik block. The block is lightweight and easy to use. 
Impact
The block will help local batik makers to increase their creativity and productivity. This will raise their competitiveness with imported batik. 
This innovation will also benefit students from textile and fashion programmes by leveraging on the ease-of-use in creating new batik designs. 
Results
The block has been tested by local batik entrepreneurs. The blocks will be distributed to the local batik makers, and training sessions will be held on the use and handling of the block beginning September 2022.
