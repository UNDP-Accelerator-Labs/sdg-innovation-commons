## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Participatory processes when working with "time-poor" citizens require ethnography and collaborators to adapt and adopt the concerned schedules, immersion in their territories and moments. 

2. Medicinal herb producers, like jaguars, are an "umbrella species", meaning that they are linked to larger ecosystems, actors, knowledge, so their well being impacts other elements. If they are well, everything else is, and vice versa. 

3. Prototypes contribute to find adjacent needs and organizational models. The technological solution requires organized people managing the solution; which is the most difficult and longest to facilitate. 

4. Over 100 herbal species are distributed in the market, evidencing the extended practice of ancestral medicine, yet, structural threats posed on this trade show the risk of extinction.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The first challenge was having a real participatory process with poor women whose work hours are so long that it leaves no time for trainings or workshops. Ethnography was a great practice as they continued to work normally and we could accompany them, however, it requires commitment and drive for field work, as it meant working at night, in a zone known to be "dangerous" or conflicting. We wanted to ensure this wasn’t an extractive process, and made sure herbalists (most of them with less than primary schooling) also learnt and reflected in the process. This made us reflect about the concept of "transferring capacities" which is so commonly used in development. When you have a participatory process from the beginning until the end, there is no need to transfer anything because participants have learnt and reflected by doing throughout the process. This process was more similar to research action where learnings are extracted as you go along. We used the market as a platform for assemblies, provided for mobilization when we had to get together in the University and it was us going to orchards and ecosystems and not producers coming to urban workshops. 

The second challenge was inserting the project in the CO. We got involved in the project from collaboration with the City Museum. To ensure articulation with CO we proposed Economic Development area to apply their methodologies "ODS cadenas de valor" which consist on capacity building with SMEs. They explained that these "beneficiaries" where too precarious for their programs as they required a more formal status. We were able to link one of their technicians to this project, but insertion in the CO portfolio continues to be the Achilles heel. Yet, RR has participated in activities and have noticed UNDP positioning from it. CO comms team have helped disseminating the work and achievements.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Ancestral Knowledge and Surveys: Medicinal herb market had no written information about their offer: what species of herbs they sell. We used Kobo surveys to collect data in a participatory way. Ancestral knowledge was collected to classify plants according to ancestral classification of "cold" and "hot" plants which related to healing-illness attributes. 

Georeferencing and crowdsource: We created a map that has georeferenced information on: markets of distribution, places of ancestral ceremonies, ecosystems of recollection, herbalists locations, communal lands. We created this map because this trade is invisible. We wanted to make visible the interconnected system. Also, we mapped recollection places because herbalists communicated to the Ministry of Environment the obstacles they face in accessing recollection ecosystems, (water contamination, deforestation, or guards impeding their passing). They were not sure about the jurisdiction of those areas, therefore, georeferenced data will serve as evidence and argument in discussions with government officials. Data in the map was also crowdsourced by community mediators, students, herbalists but also local government databases showing markets and communal lands. 

Ethnography: Deep immersion enabled us to learn different dimensions of their work. What is the dynamics in the market, work hours, and strain. These women are time poor, and interviewing requires their time. We did interview them, but during their working hours, as we did participatory observation. This meant going to the market from midnight till 5 am several times. 

Gravimetric analysis: It is a laboratory technique that consists of analyzing changes in the mass, in this case variations in the humidity of the plant. Three plants (chamomile, lemon verbena and mint) dried by two methods, with the solar oven and traditional hanging, were compared.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods are all interconnected. They all enable a deep immersion that surfaced the complexity of the system. Initially, we thought the market was the place of intervention, but the market is not isolated, and much less the largest medicinal wholesale market in Quito. Being the first link in the chain, it is connected to ecosystems, orchards, network of producers, distributors, markets, consumers, regulators, cultural practices and threats which are many.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

May 1st Platform Market

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Escuela Politécnica Nacional. 28 students from 5 careers participated in the Minga with over 100 hours of field work each, as part of their "community linkage" program.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Museum Foundation City Museum

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Quito municipality- they contributed to map with their shapefiles and data to create layers. Market directorate, and commune directorate included information.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

May 1st Platform Market

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

PAHO/WHO got interested in the intercultural health side of this project. They participated in meetings with Ministry of Health where we socialized the project as well as with Ministry of Environment to advocate about the risks medicinal plant collectors face. As allies, they have helped in the distribution of the catalogue.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Traditional intervention would have probably
