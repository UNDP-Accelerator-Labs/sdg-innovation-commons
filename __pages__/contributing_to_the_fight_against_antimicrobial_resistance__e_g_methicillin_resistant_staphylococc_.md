> Brief description of the innovation

DESCRIPTION
The skyrocketing increase in  Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and the emergence of methicillin drug resistance (MRSA) is an evident and global challenge,  Seeking for alternative antibiotics which are new, natural, plant based, cost effective and non toxic is the up to date task for global health.

The antibacterial activity of Garlic (Allium sativum) extract and it's interactions with selected antibiotics against drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant isolates of emerging bacterial pathogens that are frequently found in healthcare settings makes it of need to use garlic as a natural alternative  and supplement to antibiotics.

GARLIC PROPERTIES AND BENEFIT'S : 

1) A NATURAL INSECTICIDE
2)WOUND HEALING 
3)IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY WHEN USED AS SUPPLEMENT
4) CONTROL OF ACNE AND SKIN HEALTH. 
5) IMPROVEMENT OF HAIR GROWTH, AND REMIVAL OF DANDRUFF
6) TREATMENT OF VAGINAL YEAST INFECTIONS
7) MANAGEMENT OF COLDS
8) RWDUCTION OF TOOTH PAIN, INFLAMMATION, ANC CONTROL OF TOOTH DECAY
9) INCREASES HEALING RATE OF THRUSH (ORAL CANDIDIASIS)
10) RINGWORM TREATMENT
Chemical constituents of garlic have also been investigated for treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, blood pressure, atherosclerosis and hyperlipidaemia .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

INCOME GENERATION

Garlic is highly priced on the international market making it a potential contributor to national income when  invested in adequately, 

Locally, as  people learn more about the health benefits of garlic they are demanding more of this tasty allium, hence sensitisation and awareness programs will also increase the market for garlic products locally.

GARLIC can be made available for sale  in the following forms :

GARLIC OIL  
GARLIC INSECTICIDE SPRAY
GARLIC POWDER
GARLIC JELLY
GARLIC VINEGAR
GARLIC CHEESE
GARLIC BUTTER
GARLIC PICKLES 
GARLIC FLAKES.....e.t.c

TARGET MARKET

This innovation targets people of all age groups
Examples include :
1) individuals suffering from minor wounds, acne, lack of  hair growth, vaginal yeast infections, colds, teeth pain or decay, thrush (oral candidiasis), ring worms,cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, blood pressure, atherosclerosis and many others.

2)in the agriculture sector, Farmers can save money by using the cost effective Garlic Insecticide Spray for their crops

3) the health sector  where it can aid  in the fight to combat Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), as well as in the improvement of antibiotic therapy.
VALUE ADDITION TO ENVIRONMENT
Antimicrobial resistance is a multi sectoral crisis (affects all sectors) 
Efforts through this innovation to contribute to the fight against antimicrobial resistance will hekp create a healthier environment for human plants and animals.

> Technical Feasibility

DESIGN
The innovation is a home based setup for the  production of Natural  home made GARLIC  products which are then packaged and labeled after which they are ready to use.
Each product has its own recipe, conditions  and duration of storage .
PROTOTYPE
Home made  Natural Garlic oil,  Garlic Insecticide Spray, Garlic powder and Garlic butter , the above have been well packed in clean plastic tins (SPRAY bottle in the case of insecticide) and stored under favorable conditions for sample display.
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1)Creating awareness programs on antimicrobial resistance,  (2)sharing knowledge on the significance of Natural Plants like GARLIC in the fight against antimicrobial resistance as well as to Human Health, (3)introducing the various  garlic products and their usage/application, (4)marketing and selling of the products.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Asocial ntimicrobial resistance is a global challenge estimate to reach quite an extreme by 2050, 
Through this innovation we  will help to create awareness  in the community on antimicrobial resistance and how they can actively contribute to the fight against antimicrobial resistance, the innovation will further  help in treatment and prevention of various infections including drug resistant infections and in improvement of antibiotics therapy.R RELEVANCE
This innovation is if relevance and demand in more than the following examples:
1) individuals suffering from minor wounds, acne, lack of  hair growth, vaginal yeast infections, colds, teeth pain or decay, thrush (oral candidiasis), ring worms,cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, blood pressure, atherosclerosis and many others.

2)in the agriculture sector, Farmers can save money by using the cost effective Garlic Insecticide Spray for their crops

3) the health sector  where it can aid  in the fight to combat Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), as well as in the improvement of antibiotic therapy.
