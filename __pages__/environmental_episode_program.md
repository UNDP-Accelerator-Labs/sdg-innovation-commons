Improve Air Quality

> Description of the solution

The Chilean government's Environmental Episodes program employs short-term solutions to lessen the intensity and detrimental effects of poor air quality spikes on human health. This policy calls for declaring "Environmental Episodes" on days when exceptionally bad air quality is predicted. Such Episode notifications set off a series of official procedures and public alerts meant to enhance local air quality and promote avoidance behaviors among the general public. It has been demonstrated that the program lowers mortality rates among the elderly on the day of and in the days following the implementation of the episode, as well as ambient concentrations of particulate matter.
