In the town of Faranah in Guinea, there is a restaurant located not far from the ISAV University where students generally go to eat. As illustrated in the picture, here you have plastic tables which are therefore very light and mobile on the terrace. Because each time he receives customers whose meals often consist of coffee and the like, it represents a big risk as to the unbalance of the table. To remedy this, the managers thought of finding masses composed of cement solidified in a medium recycled box (of tomato in this case) to be fixed on the four supports of the table. It should be remembered that to solve the problem of balance, they had to find boxes of the same dimensions. this represents a solution for recycling waste, particularly medium-sized cans.
