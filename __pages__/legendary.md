> Description

Legendarias is a meeting space for women that seeks to highlight role models and learn from their knowledge and experiences. The space includes four businesswomen, entrepreneurs, or leaders from various fields, and a moderator. First, the guests present who they are, what they do, and their greatest mistakes and successes. Then, they move on to a live interview in which they collectively answer four questions: What brought them to where they are, what practical tool helps them on their path, what success means to them, and what skills an entrepreneur should have.


As a result, entrepreneurs begin to connect with local and national networks of women entrepreneurs/businesswomen, which allow them to access economic and management support for women-led micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MiPYMES) in La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. The final outcome: improved socioeconomic conditions for women entrepreneurs.
