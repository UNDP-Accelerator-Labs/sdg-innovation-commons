> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is during the implementation of the countries first national development strategy post independence the country entered into a protracted civil war which disrupted development. Now that the country has experienced relative peace post the implementation of of the peace agreement the country has now launched the second national development strategy that is a blueprint that seeks to put the country on sustainable development pathway that seeks to prioritize the strengthening of institutions for transparent, accountability, and an inclusive governance, and fostering of macroeconomic stability, and inclusive innovation that delivers benefit to people and places where the need is greatest means moving beyond business-as-usual and mobilizing cross-cutting actions which build peaceful, inclusive and resilient systems to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Africa Agenda 2040.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

South Sudan currently ranks number 186/186 the lowest in the world on the Human Development index. GDP contracted by 6.0% in 2020/21 after growth of 13.2% in 2019/20, owing to floods, locust invasions, and COVID-19. Pandemic containment measures constrained movement and business operating hours and affected the services sector. On the supply side, agriculture was hurt by the floods and locusts. Production in the oil sector, which accounts for over 75% of GDP and 80% of the industry sector’s value added, fell as some oilfields reached maturity. Public and private consumption, which drove growth on the demand side in 2020, were affected by reduced economic activity in 2020/21. Tighter monetary policy reduced inflation to an estimated 24.0% in 2020/21 from 33.3% in 2019/20.
