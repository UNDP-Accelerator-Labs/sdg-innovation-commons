> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge  is scaling Taka Bima microinsurance to waste pickers in Dodoma from a standpoint of financial literacy, insurance trust, regulatory alignment, and affordability. Although the approach has shown success in Tanga, its adaptation to Dodoma's socioeconomic and waste management scene calls for customized involvement techniques, creative payment models, and closer linkages with local government and cooperatives. This difficulty aims to pinpoint the main enablers and obstacles for sustainable development so guaranteeing inclusion, accessibility, and long-term profitability.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Originally started in Tanga in response to the financial and social risks experienced by informal garbage workers, Taka Bima is the first microinsurance program for rubbish pickers in Tanzania. Designed under a collaboration between Taka ni Ajira Foundation, UNDP Accelerator Lab, and Jubilee Insurance, the project sought to give rubbish pickers financial protection, social security, and better working circumstances. Taka Bima has shown success in improving financial resilience among waste pickers since its founding by providing reasonably priced insurance coverage catered to their demand (UNDP, 2023).

Building on this success, the emphasis now is on expanding Taka Bima to Dodoma, the political capital of Tanzania, where the waste management ecology differs greatly from Tanga. Unlike Tanga, where well-organized garbage aggregation systems exist, Dodoma's waste industry stays mostly unorganized with scattered collecting and disposal methods. Financial fragility, limited insurance awareness, legal restrictions, and scalability issues all drive this difficulty (Taka ni Ajira Foundation, 2024). Dodoma's waste pickers are typically not financially literate and are reluctant to take insurance since they view it as unreliable or difficult. Furthermore, the lack of organized garbage cooperatives raises questions regarding the long-term viability of the project since it makes collective premium payments challenging.

Moreover, institutional and legal obstacles impede fit into current social protection systems. Although the Tanzanian government has underlined financial inclusion via policies such the National Financial Inclusion Framework (NFIF) 2018–2022, informal workers are mostly left out of official insurance schemes (Bank of Tanzania, 2022). Adapting Taka Bima to this new terrain will depend critically on the Dodoma Municipal Council, local rubbish collectors, and financial institutions as well as on other factors.

Dodoma's waste pickers work without any kind of financial protection right now, which causes unstable income, poor access to healthcare, and dangerous working circumstances. A sudden medical emergency or accident might cause great financial difficulty, therefore aggravating poverty and economic uncertainty. Since they remain outside municipal garbage policies and official labor systems, the lack of insurance further reduces their negotiating strength. Furthermore, mistrust of official financial services implies that many waste pickers keep depending on unofficial savings systems, which lack long-term security (World Bank, 2023).

Scaling Taka Bima to Dodoma seeks to close the gap between financial protection mechanisms and informal garbage workers. Important learning questions will probe adoption challenges, financial models, legal issues, and how technology could improve accessibility. The knowledge gained from this expansion will guide a national road map for including rubbish pickers into Tanzania's larger circular economy and social protection programs. By means of strategic alliances, creative business models, and community-driven participation, Taka Bima can establish a scalable and sustainable financial safety net for rubbish pickers spread around Tanzania.

Although they have great difficulty, informal  waste pickers are absolutely vital in managing urban waste in Tanzania. Only 1.8% of waste pickers have health insurance; 88% of waste pickers finance their healthcare out-of-pocket according to a 2023 survey spanning eight areas including Dodoma. Their lack of financial security makes them susceptible to financial difficulties resulting from health emergencies. Insurance coverage is still poor nationally; just 6.3% of the adult population had official insurance in 2009, but unofficial insurance use is almost 2%. Although Dodoma generates around 350 tons of solid garbage every day, only roughly 184 tons are collected through official services. Collecting valuable items such plastic bottles (86.2%), plastic containers (66.5%), and metals (55.8%), informal rubbish pickers help to close this gap. Even with their contributions, women frequently operate in dangerous environments without protective gear, which increases health risks and injuries. Acknowledging their critical importance in trash management, scaling microinsurance projects like Taka Bima in Dodoma is crucial to guarantee these workers financial stability and healthcare.

​Recent observations in Dodoma highlight the pressing challenges faced by waste pickers, underscoring the urgency of addressing their needs. A 2023 survey revealed that over 50% of waste pickers earn below the poverty line, with 35% making between TZS 3,000 to TZS 5,000 daily, equivalent to USD 1.11–USD 1.85. This economic hardship limits their access to essential services like health insurance. Additionally, Dodoma's rapid urbanization has led to inadequate waste management infrastructure, resulting in illegal dumping and environmental degradation. Despite their significant contributions to waste management, waste pickers often face stigmatization and lack formal recognition, exacerbating their vulnerability. These factors collectively emphasize the critical need for interventions that provide financial security and social support to waste pickers in Dodoma.
