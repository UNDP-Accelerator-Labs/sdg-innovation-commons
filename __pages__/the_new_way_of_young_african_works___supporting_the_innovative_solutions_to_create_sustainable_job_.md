THE NEW WAY OF YOUNG AFRICAN WORKS : SUPPORTING THE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE JOBS FOR YOUTH AND WOMEN IN COTE D'IVOIRE
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Despite all the efforts made by the Government and other actors to improve the youth entrepreneurship (male and female), the challenge of youth and women's precarious living conditions and unemployment remain. It is therefore essential to address youth unemployment in a different way, making an emphasis on innovation and non-obvious targets. Indeed, different programmes often focused on the traditional targets (young university and school graduates as well as those from women's and vulnerable youth groups) leaving behind non-obvious targets of young people and women from disadvantaged and rural areas. On the other hand, support for the development of income-generating activities for young people and women as well as for youth entrepreneurship has not really led to innovations that provide solutions to societal problems in the country while having a strong potential and impact in terms of job and wealth creation. This situation, therefore, calls for swift action, including developing models and structures to support innovation-based youth entrepreneurship, building their capacity to leverage these structures to develop innovative solutions that create employment opportunities for all. To achieve this, the UNDP Côte d'Ivoire Office via the AccLab, initiated a support to the promotion of innovative solutions with a high potential for job and wealth creation for youth and women in Côte d'Ivoire.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Côte d'Ivoire, the number of young people joining the labour force each year makes the severity of the labour market's tension much more visible to young people, according to the ERI-ESI 2017 survey report. Thus, youth unemployment is a situation that pushes many young people to irregular and clandestine immigration. In certain localities, particularly in the south-west of the country, clandestine crossing of the Mediterranean is maintained by networks of smugglers. Despite the risks they are subject to and all the awareness-raising activities carried out by national and international institutions and organisations, many young men and women continue to engage in this activity, without any certainty of reaching their destination. According to figures made public by the General Directorate of Ivorians Abroad (DGIE), Côte d'Ivoire has gone from 10th to 4th position in terms of the countries of origin of migrants. Côte d'Ivoire occupies this very poor position with 7% of the total number of registered illegal migrants. In addition, as part of the implementation of the durable solutions strategy, several interventions have been undertaken for the sustainable reintegration of displaced persons and returnees in Côte d'Ivoire. To this end, supporting young people in their entrepreneurship can only help them to stay in their localities and to develop economically. However, there are many obstacles to their promotion, notably the lack of funding and the lack of appropriate technical support. The challenge is greater for women, who suffer from the lack of recognition of their rights, including the lack of access to means of production and assets. In the country, only 24.4% of businesses are run by women. These challenges for young people have been exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic. Average annual household income has fallen by an average of 47.2%. The employment of 78.8% of household heads has been impacted due to cash flow pressures affecting 64.4% of informal sector enterprises, which are facing a reduction in activity level of 52.8%. As a result, the number of additional households that fall below the poverty line due to the coronavirus is estimated at 32%. The COVID19 crisis has, nevertheless, been an opportunity for UNDP, through its Accelerator Lab, to demonstrate the existence of an innovative potential among young start-ups and entrepreneurs in Côte d'Ivoire. This potential deserves to be supported to flourish. In view of these challenges, the Government has set up a Social Programme in 2019 to help strengthen the inclusiveness of the country's economic growth. This vast programme emphasises, among other things, the improvement of employability and access to decent and stable employment for young people and women. In order to give concrete expression to the Government's ambition, the Ministry for the Promotion of Youth and Youth Employment&nbsp; is implementing a special operation in favour of young people, called "AGIR POUR LES JEUNES/ACT FOR YOUTH". In 2022, the Government launched the second phase of its Social Programme (PSGouv 2), which runs from 2022 to 2024 and aims to consolidate the achievements of the previous phase of PSGouv 1 and accelerate the pace of poverty and social inequality reduction. In order to measure the social impact of governmental action, PSGouv 2 will specifically contribute to delivering sustainable solutions to the issue of fragility in the northern areas, access to jobs, and the empowerment of young people and women. Through this programme, the aim is to support the employability of youth and women through the deployment of an integrated national entrepreneurship innovation system by putting forward the tools and approaches of the Accelerator Lab (AccLab). UNDP's Acclabs are designed to be the largest and fastest growing learning and innovation network of its kind in country offices, including Côte d'Ivoire. They strive to accelerate development impact, including by deploying the latest thinking from complexity science, lead user innovation and collective intelligence.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to contribute to accelerating and making sustainable the employability of youth and women in Côte d'Ivoire?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The methods and tools used will help to pilot, develop and deploy an innovative system to generate, identify and scale up youth-led solutions to boost employability and create wealth.&nbsp; The implementation strategy is based on an experimentation phase expected to last at least 7-8 months and a nationwide deployment phase in all regions of the country. It will also build on previous experiences and ongoing initiatives in the country to identify optimal approaches to reach difficult groups that have little voice in development issues. The programme and Lab teams will : 1- activate a pipeline of actors to identify (mapping) at least 2,000 agnostic, atypical and scalable solutions in the sector that may be at different stages of maturity (early stage, prototype and advanced). A strategy will be built to attract the maximum number of innovators, in particular by tapping into networks of grassroots innovators among youth, urban and rural women. This will help to focus on innovative solutions with the ambition to address development challenges (social and economic), both in rural and urban areas and covering the whole country without exclusion. Atypical solutions with a high potential for creating decent and fulfilling jobs for young people will be favoured through collaboration with actors of the innovation ecosystem. 2- a variety of channels will be used to reach out and facilitate the submission of solutions as outlined above. These will include, but are not limited to, the operation of an easy-to-use digital platform for online submissions, innovation challenges (e.g. the organisation of regional hackathons), solution safaris or innovation caravans, innovation weeks, design thinking and co-creation bootcamps and inter-vocational and technical school technology innovation competitions 3- The solutions at different maturity levels will then go through a pre-selection process 4- the programme will generate knowledge on how to strengthen innovation pipelines, ecosystems and relevant institutions working with strong actors whose missions and domains of expertise are conformed with the Young Africa Innovation (YAI) 5- Experimentation and scalling up: Each proven solutions that will receive more intensive and tailored support in stage 3, based on their performance, replicability and scalability. Each solution will have an intensive and tailored programme on issues such as financing, human resources, leadership, market expansion, penetration of regional markets such as the FTAA, raising funds from investors and risk management. Solutions will receive seed investment based on their real needs and their ability to absorb support. &nbsp;

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These new data sources make it possible to identify little-known and little-promoted areas of activity that nevertheless provide rapid solutions to societal challenges
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The main beneficiaries of this program will be, on the one hand, youth and women who will be able to find some responses to their problems of socio-economic precariousness. The other major beneficiary will be the government which will be able, in addition to the traditional ways brought to this problem of employability of the youth and women, to have an accelerated solution to address this challenge, which is one of the major challenges which threatens even the stability of the African countries.
