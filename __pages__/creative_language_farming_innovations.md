Creative language Farming innovations

> Brief description of the innovation

my Innovation is in relation to the reduction of hunger by putting Zambia on the-edge of feeding the whole world at large through irrigation innovation by partnering with small scale farmers and borehole company's to bring about the feeding of our people in Zambia, Africa and the rest of the world.
my innovation will enable small scale farmers to practice farming all year round through irrigation methods which have proven not only be beneficial to the farmers but also the earth at large ,this  can be achieved by encouraging our farmers to sign up with the government My project built on the integrity that farmers need to plant crops all year round in order for us to achieve that goal the government can set up a scheme which will be able to allow farmers to come forward sign up for a certain scheme, which the government will partner with local exploration companies and small scale farmer cooperatives that will provide lessons on irrigation farming which in turn will help the farmers in planting crops or year round by doing so will be able to allow the growth of our economy by increasing food security as well as making sure that Zambia is on point with feeding the world at large given the fact that there numerous countries which are surrounding Zambia have very high hunger rate and this we will enable us to supply food after having such a huge bumper harvest in their boss is applied to them four at a certain fee in in turn bringing in income back to our country enabling the economy to grow to a certain level of sustainability I believe it is best for the growth of our country.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The irrigation industry is an important driver of economic activity. Based on a 2009 study commissioned by the Irrigation Association, the irrigation industry contributes approximately $19 billion to the gross domestic product of the United States and contributes approximately 150,000 jobs to the U.S. economy. 
In addition to this direct economic impact, irrigated agriculture accounts for nearly 50 percent of total crop revenues in the United States, despite that only 17 percent of the nation’s cropland is irrigated. The economic value created by irrigated agriculture will continue to grow as the world works to double agricultural output between now and 2050.
Investments in efficient irrigation products, technology and services also lead to significant cost savings associated with water use for consumers. As the price of water increases, the benefits associated with efficient irrigation increases. Implementing efficient irrigation practices is a sound economic investment for consumers.
The Irrigation Association believes that the irrigation industry is a growing and significant contributor to economic growth.
Irrigation can improve nutrition outcomes through multiple pathways.
•Irrigation can improve the quantity and diversity of foods consumed within the household.
•Irrigation can be an important entry path for women's empowerment.
•Few rigorous studies assess the linkages between irrigation and nutrition.
•Nutrition-sensitive irrigation interventions and programs should be encouraged.
Profitability and economic benefits from SmallScale Irrigation 
By using multiple methods to assess profitability of small scale irrigation in different value chains. Research shows that SmallScaleIrrigation directly contributes to economic growth by generating higher profits and incomes for farmers compared to rainfed agriculture and offers opportunities to entrepreneurs and others in irrigated value chains.

> Technical Feasibility

Drip irrigation is the method of watering the plant drop by drop close to the root. This method reduces water loss due to filtration and evaporation. Instead of applying fertilizers on the soil surface near the plant, these products are mixed in the water and delivered drop by drop on the root, achieving greater effectiveness and better results in the quality of the crops.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Agriculture is the main occupation of most areas in Zambia , but due to the continuous lack of rain it has become an unprofitable economic activity. There has been a rapid decline in underground water resources because monsoons occur only in alternate years.

The installation of systems for the efficient use of water for irrigation is the phase that begins once the availability of water has been increased, through the construction of a reservoir.

Drip irrigation is the method of watering the plant drop by drop close to the root. This method reduces water loss due to filtration and evaporation. Instead of applying fertilizers on the soil surface near the plant, these products are mixed in the water and delivered drop by drop on the root, achieving greater effectiveness and better results in the quality of the crops. In addition, up to 75% of water is saved, which can be used to irrigate new growing areas.The rural population of most of the past in zambia  cannot afford to waste the precious water they receive during the rainy season, which is why drip is the most efficient irrigation method for horticultural species.

Specifically, drip irrigation has the following advantages:

Proven water savings
Improved crop yields
More efficient use of fertilizers
Use as a pesticide and improvement of resistance against pests
Less weed growth
Saving energy in pumping and reducing labor costs
Suitable for marginal lands and with inferior water quality
Maintenance of the quality of the soil, with the consequent improvement of the productivity of the land.
