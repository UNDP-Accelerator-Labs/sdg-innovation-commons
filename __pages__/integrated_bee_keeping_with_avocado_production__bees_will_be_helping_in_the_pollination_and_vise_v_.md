> Title of the innovation

Integrated bee keeping with avocado production, bees will be helping in the pollination and vise versa.

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will be the production of avocado and honey, the varieties of avocados will be; the Hass avocado for international market through the copperbelt avocado multipurpose were I'm a member, and the other varieties will be local for the local market, these will grafted and within 3 years I should be harvesting, the bee keeping will be intergrated with the avocado production in order to increase pollination of avocado flowers, and bees will also benefit from the flowers. The seedlings are already prepared for planting, the land has been secured with an 11 hectares. The only challenge now is the bee hives, land preparations and the irrigation system.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income through selling of the honey harvested, selling of the avocado both locally and internationally throu the cooperative. It will improve my village chicken rearing through setting up the chicken runs, shelters at the farm, building of infrastructure, acquiring of the incubator. In area of marketing, Im targeting super markets, traders in the markets, initially there the prices of avocado in the markets is very good hence it will not be a problem in growing the business. It will be organic farming

> Technical Feasibility

Firstly procurement of land which I have already done, the nursing preparations which I have already established at home, Land preparations which I'm yet to start anytime soon, i.e cutting of trees and digging of planting holes, transplanting of the seedlings into the main field to be done in December this year, setting up of the irrigation system next year in April, making of bee hives in may next year, installation of the bee hives starting may next year,

> Anticipated Social Impact

The avocado can be used to make oil, lotions, eaten , the Honey can be used in main ways, medicinal, my innovation can heip improve the lives of others direct through employment, indirectly through consumption of the avocado and the honey.
