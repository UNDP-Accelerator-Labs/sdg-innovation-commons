## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Acceleration of a Digital Social Services Delivery Model to address the needs of the most vulnerable in Kazakhstan 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The socio-economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is exacerbating the scale of financial hardship among poor families and households and threatens to roll back years of progress in reducing poverty and to leave many, such as children and women from vulnerable groups, deprived of essential services. The possible multiple phases of the pandemic mean that digital transformation tools become ever more important. This is consistent with line ministries’ policies related to both responsiveness to the pandemic but also long-term national development aspirations. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

For Kazakhstan, the COVID-19 pandemic has significant implications across population groups and key sectors, the full extent of which is still not clear. What is apparent, however, is that the health crisis is driving economic and social changes which are accelerating pre-existing challenges related to levels of poverty, disadvantage and vulnerability. The crisis also threatens to undermine, and reverse significant progress made in recent years, which has seen Kazakhstan transition from lower middle income to upper middle-income status in under two decades and with falls in the poverty rate over three consecutive years with an estimated rate of 8.5% in 2019. The pandemic has already led to a revision of the National Strategic Development Plan (2025) with the support of the UNCT. The Government also initiated two response packages which have included basic income and social support payments, and additional funding of the Employment Roadmap, tax breaks, repayment holidays and preferential loans for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the public. Upon the conclusion of the state of emergency, the government adopted a Comprehensive Plan of Economic Recovery for 2020, which comprises instruments and measures to stimulate economic activity, support employment and increase public income.Currently, all social services are subject to an application procedure. When an individual or family is in hardship, various agencies (social, educational, health, etc.) conduct their field-specific assessment of the family's needs by interviewing an applicant to determine the guaranteed package of services within their scope. However, the family/person must independently apply to the multiple government agencies to obtain such social services. This is a lengthy and bureaucratic process (14+ legislative acts) with inefficiencies such as complexity, fragmentation, delay, etc. and, which results in time, effort, cost and frustration on the part of the applicants.

Between May and June 2020, a detailed Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SEIA, 2020) was carried out. This has provided detailed data on impacts, particularly those on the most vulnerable groups in society. Key issues are briefly grouped and summarized in below: 

- Quarantine measures and the state of emergency heavily impacted the most vulnerable groups of the population, 40% of the unemployed and 38% of people on low incomes reported that they could not afford to buy enough food, 43% of this group reported difficulties paying for utilities, 38% of the unemployed and 47% of people on low incomes had to borrow money and/or take loans to pay for essential commodities. 

- In the first quarantine period, 60.8% of all respondents applied for state financial assistance (a social payment of 42,500 KZT). Of these, 21% received both payments but 41.6% received only one payment, 35.7% of those who asked for help were refused the social payments, with the elderly (71%) and PwD (52.5%) suffering the most rejections. This suggests that the needs assessment system is failing the vulnerable. 40.6% of SEIA respondents stated that the social payments (42,500 KZT) provided significant financial assistance, for 26.7% they partially eased the financial burden. However, for 32.7% of respondents the payments did not solve their financial difficulties. The majority of respondents (53%) experienced difficulties in obtaining state assistance during the first quarantine, and one in five (18.6%) in the vulnerable groups did not receive assistance from the state due to insurmountable registration difficulties.

Particularly vulnerable groups include: elderly people, people with disabilities, children with disabilities, children living in families of social risk, as well as single mothers, women and children who have become survivors of domestic violence, victims of human trafficking, and migrants with irregular legal status etc. These groups have, in particular, had to cope with loss of income, restriction of access to social, legal, educational, rehabilitation services, etc. further compounding difficulties they already faced in accessing services even before the pandemic reached Kazakhstan, such as migrants with irregular legal status

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab team crafted the project proposal application, namely “Acceleration of a Digital Social Services Delivery Model to address the needs of the most vulnerable in Kazakhstan”, and ensured the successful resource mobilization (850,000 USD) to the country office. The project which builds upon existing digital tools to deliver a platform capable of rapidly and efficiently collecting, integrating and processing information on the most vulnerable groups in Kazakhstan, to help analyze, target and process support for key groups. Ensuring cohesion and joined up responses across and between key social sectors is a priority for ensuring the consistency of the approach so that technically sound and professional support is provided in a holistic manner. Given increases in need coupled with constraints on Government human and financial resources ensuring that sector responses address needs in an integrated way is also a key component of improving the efficiency of service delivery mechanisms and pathways.

Following the launch of the Digital Family Card, it has attracted interest from national and international organisations, including UNICEF, the World Bank, and private sector partners. To share lessons learned from the Digital Family Card and introduce the team behind the innovation tool, UNDP Kazakhstan created a platform - the conference "Digital by default for People and the Planet" as part of the National Knowledge Week - 2022. Both vice ministers (of the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Population) highlighted the impact of the Digital Family Card on the socio-economic development of the country. During the conference, the team presented the project at the digital solutions exhibition supported by UNDP Kazakhstan, where the public could also learn more about this innovative tool.

The project forged innovative partnerships with local experts and companies in the field of data science, machine learning, and information technology, which allowed the product to be developed with full local expertise. The raised funds facilitated the timely recruitment of various stakeholders, as the experts had not only theoretical knowledge of social protection systems, but also practical experience in the Kazakh context and existing relationships with key partners, which enabled the development of a viable product.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The role of social workers and specialists equal to them is increasing. They must work with families in their households, identify vulnerabilities, and also take preventive action so that the family does not face more complex aspects of social disadvantage.The next phase is to develop an individualised plan for the at-risk person/family, describing the actions that can be taken to move that at-risk person/family out of the difficult living situation based on the Digital Family Card data analysis. It is important to note that not all public services can be provided in a proactive format. For example, there are situations where a person or a family needs the help of qualified social workers. This requires the development of a mechanism to protect personal data through check-in questionnaires that contain more than 120 vulnerability indicators and go through a coding process to ensure that third parties (social workers, public officials) do not have access to personal data. If an individual/family is at risk, the appropriate staff should receive only one check-in questionnaire, which is used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the difficult living situation and automatically create an individualised plan for the family's exit from that difficult living situation. Automated notifications about provided governmental support measures are sent to the family members by the Digital Family Card.
