## Using the wastewater of the lime-washing process for corn

To produce maize tortillas, maize is first cooked with lime for 12-18 hours. Nejayote is the wastewater resulting from the process, a land pollutant. In Mexico, it is estimated that in 2012, 14.4 million cubic meters of Nejayote were produced per month. How to manage this waste is connected to how it can be better utilized.

The project seeks alternatives and methods that take advantage of the Nejayote for the production of energy and agricultural products by identifying the needs of a community and connecting with ways in which it can mitigate the Nejayote contamination problem and also a way in which it can help millers to profit from the waste they produce.
