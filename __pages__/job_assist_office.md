## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Will recent graduates and the unemployed youth have greater chances of obtaining jobs if they are provided with employability skills and are connected to potential employers?



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF recent graduates and the unemployed youth are provided with employability skills and are connected to potential employers, THEN they will have greater chances of obtaining jobs, THEN youth unemployment rate will decrease

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

- Partner with private entities to set up Job Assist Office (JAO) to provide training and networking opportunities for youth
- Collect data of participants using JAO services
- Monitor the number of participants who managed to get a job after receiving JAO services
- Statistically analyze and compare treatment group and control group

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of youth who got job through JAO services

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

a control group will be established through statistical modeling to compare with treatment group and measure the impact of the experimentation.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months until 30 of June 2022

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
