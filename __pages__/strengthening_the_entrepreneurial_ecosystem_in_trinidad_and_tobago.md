Strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Trinidad and Tobago
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that there is a rotating door around micro and small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) support programs in Trinidad and Tobago, indicating that new enterprises encounter difficulties in securing sustainable financing and other support which hinders their rapid growth, sustainability and export-readiness.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Trinidad and Tobago, numerous business incubators and accelerators have emerged with the aim of equipping entrepreneurs with the necessary training, tools, knowledge, and networks to expand their ventures. These include the National Integrated Business System (IBIS), the Ideas to Innovation competition (i2i), Shaping the Future Innovation Challenge competition, the UNDP four innovation challenges (from 2021-2024), the Global Environmental Facility Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP), the DIA Youth Innovators Lab, the Full Circle Pitch circular economy competition, among others, arising from government ministries, universities and development partners. Despite these efforts, the entrepreneurial landscape continues to be fragmented, particularly in areas such as access to capital, fundraising, mentorship, and R&amp;D research. 

The alignment of interests and collaboration among public, private, and academic players has seen some improvement, yet there is still much to do. The data available on the state of entrepreneurship is limited, but insights gleaned from articles, reports, and direct feedback from entrepreneurs consistently highlight challenges related to achieving product-market fit and scaling. 

This narrative underscores the historical context of the challenge, the driving forces behind it, the key players involved, the current state of affairs, and the desired outcomes for a more cohesive and supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gaps and create a more integrated and effective environment for entrepreneurial success. 

The UNDP Accelerator Lab was approached for assistance with this challenge by ScaleUp TT, a partner of the state-run Unit Trust Corporation (UTC), an investment company managing USD 3.2 billion.

According to the Central Statistical Office, Trinidad and Tobago is home to 26,000 registered businesses, 90% of which are classified as SMEs. These businesses have had opportunities to access  both tangible and intangible resources, allocated across a variety of programs such as the EU-ACP, Idea 2 Innovation (i2i), ScaleUP Trinidad and Tobago (ScaleUP TT), and UNDP Challenges (including the Green Innovation Challenge, Tobago Innovation Challenge, and Peace Innovation Challenge, Sargassum Innovation Challenge and Plastic Challenge). For the UNDP and its partners alone, this amounts to close to USD500K over the last 4 years, and significantly more from state actors and international donors over the same period.   

However, despite these opportunities, the nation has been grappling with a rising unemployment rate, which stood at 5.4% as of March 2024. This presents a unique opportunity for entrepreneurship, a proven catalyst for economic growth, as the key to reversing this trend. By going beyond fostering entrepreneurship, but developing an entrepreneurial ecosystem map. A healthy entrepreneurial sector is a sign of a healthy and innovative economy and society. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that self-employment took a significant hit during the pandemic falling from 25.6 per cent of the population in 2020 to 24.5 per cent in 2022, stemming an upward trend since at least 2012. Entrepreneurial strength also supports innovativeness. With an innovation score of 18.5 (where higher scores signify more innovativeness) Trinidad and Tobago is not recognized as a particularly innovative nation. It ranks number 51 in its income group and 17th in the Latin America and Caribbean region (World Intellectual Property Organzation (Global Innovation Index 2024, WIPO).

Among the items of qualitative evidence, there is the observation of organizers of business and innovation competitions that there is a high incidence of repeat participants, inclusive of involvement in business incubators and accelerators.  Additionally, many have also wondered why they are not seeing many new applicants, participants or winners in these various programs. Many commented that the current programs seem to overlap and are not coordinated to ensure that one builds upon the other. Finally, the overall sentiment is that more needs to be done to create a vibrant ecosystem that supports companies across the entire entrepreneurship spectrum that allows them to grow from one stage to the next.

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Current collaborators will be champions of what information and tools arise from our challenge: these are the Caribbean Industrial Research Institute (CARIRI), the Trinidad and Tobago Chamber of Commerce and the Unit Trust Corporation in addition to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). We'll see what early leads there are in the 2025.
