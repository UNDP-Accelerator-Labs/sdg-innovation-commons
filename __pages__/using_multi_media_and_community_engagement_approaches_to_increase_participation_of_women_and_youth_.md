## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Using multi-media and community engagement approaches to increase participation of women and youth in the fishing industry (Harvesting)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that women are currently underrepresented in the harvesting stage of the fishing industry in Barbados.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Barbados, the harvest sector is male-dominated with female participation accounting for less than 1% of the workforce. However, the participation of women in the post harvest sector as fish processors, vendors and business owners is significant accounting for more than 80%. There are approximately 6 full-time women fishers in Barbados. A fisher women video was therefore created to showcase women involved in not only the processing and sale/vendoring component of the fishing industry but also participating in the harvesting stage.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Through the use of visual media and community engagement techniques, we will highlight the opportunities and increase the participation of women, girls and youth in the harvesting of fish particularly however we will introduce to them the general opportunities in the industry.
