Solutions Catalogue to empower people to Tackle Air Pollution
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Can we effectively map out solutions to tackle air pollution in North Macedonia, integrating global insights while addressing local contexts and needs?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The escalating threat of air pollution in North Macedonia poses a significant challenge to public health and well-being. Despite efforts, the country grapples with persistent pollution issues, impacting both urban and

rural areas. Local governments, environmental agency, and communities are involved in addressing this issue, yet the complexity and multiplicity of pollution sources demand comprehensive strategies. The current situation is marked by a pressing need for coordinated action, as air pollution continues to

detrimentally affect the populace and the environment. UNDP CO North Macedonia has already an active project on Tackling Air Pollution, and currently is working with 5 municipalities in the country.

There is a growing concern among citizens regarding the visible impacts of air pollution on their daily lives, such as respiratory issues and reduced outdoor activities. This challenges has been very dominant

in the public discourse and in the media beyond the capital city of North Macedonia. Additionally, stakeholders report a lack of awareness about sustainable practices and technologies that could mitigate pollution, highlighting the need for comprehensive education and outreach efforts.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Three reasons:

1. The Acc Lab works closely with project team on Tackling Air Pollution at UNDP CO North Macedonia and is suggesting a different approach on how to learn and scale solutions that would reduce the air pollution.

2. Leveraging its experimental approach, the Acc Lab can test innovative solutions and strategies tailored to the unique challenges faced by North Macedonia.

3. By scooping global knowledge, engaging with both global and local expertise, the Acc Lab can facilitate the integration of best practices and technologies into actionable policies and initiatives.
