> Type of the Solution

Technological

> Affected Sector

Transport

> Description of the solution

The ANTISMOG project by Net Sas uses an innovative hydrogen-based technology to reduce emissions from combustion engines by up to 80%. This open-source technology enhances fuel combustion, leading to fewer emissions and improved engine efficiency.

> Socio-economic effects

Decreases vehicle emissions, enhances fuel efficiency, reduces maintenance costs.

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Who led the solution

- private sector

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

All the available materials cover the project at its early stage of commercialization, timescale is unclear, however in case of sucessful implementation the long-term timescale is likely.
