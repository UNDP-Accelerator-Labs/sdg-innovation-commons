## Description

Following a series of co-creation through participatory Focus Group Discussions (pFGDs) with People in Need of Social Welfare Services (PPKS) in urban Jakarta as well as solutions mapping consultation with stakeholders, UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab is developing SEDAYA - a community empowerment hub, with the following objectives:

1. Provide entrepreneurship training and business sustainability mentoring to PENA (Pahlawan Ekonomi Nusantara/Indonesian Economic Hero) graduates and other vulnerable micro enterprises in Jakarta.

2. Conduct Business and Risk Profile Assessment to selected PENA graduates, in order to examine their potential to access additional micro equity funding from social investors.

3. Foster collaboration and partnerships among key public and private stakeholders.

These objectives are intended to achieve two main outcomes:

1. Improved entrepreneurial skills of training participants to stay above the poverty line

2. Integration of lessons learned into the government’s poverty graduation strategy

This initiative offers a financing solution in the form of micro equity: an innovative financing mechanism that facilitates investments to strengthen business sustainability of emerging enterprises, with a Sharia-compliance profit sharing mechanism between the investors and micro enterprises.  

Elements of this pilot initiative will be tailored to help PENA graduates grow and sustain their businesses, while also equipping other PPKS who have not been reached through government programmes with the necessary skills and information to start their own businesses. The training modules and profile assessment will be conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Office of Social Affairs of DKI Jakarta (Dinsos DKI Jakarta), and Sub-National Development Planning Agency of DKI Jakarta (Bappeda DKI Jakarta).
