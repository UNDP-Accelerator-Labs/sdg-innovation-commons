> Title of the innovation

To build sustainable businesses and communities in partnership with the black diaspora of USA and europe

> Brief description of the innovation

We have been building inroads and connections across the diaspora to facilitate better local grass roots investment in key sectors agriculture inc processing, small scale mineral processing and tourism. Coupled with repatriation opportunities for those descendants of slaves who would then bring further resources to stay in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Access to funds with favourable culturally sensitive terms is extremely difficult to come by for most of the population but equitable partnership with the diaspora ensures mutually beneficial success. The profits stay in Zambia and allow us to build better communities

> Technical Feasibility

With access to cash many local entrepreneurs can better sow and harvest crops year round. Processing equipment can more thanquadruple profits plus logistical support and market creation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Big business has not historically made a difference to the lives of the masses as inequalities generally stay the same. With this system and government support we actually start from the ground up taking investment where its needed most with no gimmicks just real change.
