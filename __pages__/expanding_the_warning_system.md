> Description of the solution

Expanding the warning system that lets residents know the extreme heat is imminent and offering first aid training so they could recognize the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke to help each other. When trying to protect people from extreme heat, there is need to drill down to the local level in order to do effective interventions. Some of the solutions, in the West Phoenix neighborhood, people proposed included: adding shaded walkways for common routes along with water fountains, expanding the warning system that lets residents know extreme heat is imminent, and offering first aid training so they could recognize the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke to help each other.
