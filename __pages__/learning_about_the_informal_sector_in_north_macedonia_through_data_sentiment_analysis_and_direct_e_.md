> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

We have partnered with a civil society organization called 'Analytica' to conduct the focus groups and interviews with members of the informal sector, as well as with a private sector entity - a company called 'Pikassa' to conduct the media sentiment analysis.
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can we learn more about the informal sector in North Macedonia, through deploying a media sentiment analysis, and by engaging with the workers in the sector directly?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we learn more about the motivations, barriers and potentials of the workers in the informal sector, we can then make more informed arguments as UNDP towards the

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test our hypothesis we did three distinct activities: a. Media sentiment analysis, focusing on mainstream and new media and how they cover the topic of 'informality' in the country. b. Focus groups with members of the informal sector in the country [with dedicated focus groups for women in the digital and creative industries] c. Interviews with members from the informal sector in the country  

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time of the team, approximately 10% for one learning cycle.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven, we learned a lot on how our media reports [lack thereof] on the topic of informality. We also learned about the motivations and barriers that workers in the sector have, and we presented these findings in our country office. That has informed our programing and project activities.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I would do more focus groups, and more in depth interviews - with institutions and organizations that work on this challenge in the country

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Three months.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

For the media sentiment analysis we spent close to 2000 usd, and for the focus groups and interviews close to

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

As a part of the follow up activities for this pilot, we had several internal UNDP presentations of the key findings, and we worked with two country office projects to re-design their activities in the sector of informality.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The interplay of innovative methods, new forms of data and co-creating papers and analysis with unusual partners enabled us to have a holistic approach to such a complex topic. If we didn’t use social media sentiment analysis we would not be aware what are the narratives around the topic of informality in our society for the past three years. For instance we learned that key societal opinion makers, rarely have topics from the informal economy in their focus. There were only 87 public opinions pieces on the topic,  written by 20 authors in this period, which is 0,4% of the total published opinion pieces in the period.  Furthermore, during the focus groups we found that students who are state scholarship receivers prefer to work in the informal sector because if they formalize they might use their scholarships, due to the law regulations.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

We collaborated with a CO project that aims to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance in improving overall financial management and ensuring good governance in managing public resources. The project is  using our findings to learn more about the perceptions and opinions of workers in the informal sector in order to create more data and citizen driven policies. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The informal sector in our country is a sources for a lot of public debates and policies, so by working in this space, and shaping the activities of UNDP we contributed to a larger conversation on the topic.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

I think co-designing this process with the CSO with whom we did the focus groups and interviews was of particular importance, I would strongly encourage this to be a codesign process, if replicated in another country.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Both activities [the media sentiment + the focus groups] can be easily replicated in other relevant SDG areas

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

n/a

> What surprised you?

The narratives of the informal sector in our media. That bit took me by surprise, I was convinced that this complex topic is being treated in a more holistic way by old/new media.
