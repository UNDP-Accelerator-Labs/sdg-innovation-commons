> Title of the innovation

KaMbeka Technology Zm

> Brief description of the innovation

Every day a pregnant woman dies from preventable conditions due to a delay in decision to seek health care, delay in reaching care and delay in reaching adequate care. About 70% of those deaths can be prevented with easy access to healthcare.
KaMbeka Tech is a social enterprise that aims at improving access to healthcare by pregnant women in underprivileged communities through the provision of a bicycle ambulance that is affordable, has a flexible payment plan, always available and small enough to navigate narrow rural roads. At the same time KaMbeka Tech creates employment for at least two people.
Each pregnant woman that uses our transport system receives vital health information at no cost regarding safe practices before, during and after pregnancy as an incentive. This is done by the use of a low cost-based technology system (SMS) that allows the woman to receive the information regardless of the type of phone as no internet is required. The pregnant woman and her influencer also receive a notification to remind her of her next antenatal visit so as to achieve the minimum 8 visits as recommended by world health organization

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target market is every pregnant woman between the ages 18 to 45 living in underprivileged communities. KaMbeka Tech will generate income through two models.
Business to Customer Model- A ride to the hospital will cost about K10. However, it will be priced based on the distance.
Business to Business Model-Hospitals, governments, NGOs can subscribe to use our services for about K500 per month.
As a change maker who is committed to ending preventable maternal and new born deaths in my community by 2030 I am aware that I cannot archive this goal by working in isolation. For this reason, I am confident that the challenge prize will give me an opportunity to scale my business by having at least one bicycle ambulance in each rural part of Zambia, offer short paramedic training for ambulance drivers thus creating more impact in the community and contributing to the attainment of SDG3.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently our prototype is under development. Our bicycle ambulance will be a two-wheel trailer that will carry a metal stretcher(cushioned) and will be towed by a common bicycle. The stretcher will be produced locally, large enough to carry the user, light enough to be towed (22kg) and measure 200cm by 90 cm. The stretcher will be made from sheet metal as is easy to clean and a larger chain will secure the stretcher to the common bicycle. To offer sun and rain protection to the user a light plastic canopy will be added. 
The implementation process will run in 3 phases, phase 1,2 and 3.

PRODUCT WILL BE PROTOTYPED WITH A SMALL GROUP BEFORE SCALING JULY2022-DEC 2022

> Anticipated Social Impact

Through the provision of an affordable and available bicycle ambulance, we anticipate an increase (50% increase) in the number of pregnant women attending antenatal care services thus having more contact with health care providers and making it possible to prevent, detect and treat any pregnancy related complications early. By the year 2025, we aim to rescue 4000 women, 6000 babies from preventable maternal and neonatal deaths. At KaMbeka Tech, we are in the business of saving lives.
As we are an engine of growth and jobs for our riders, we anticipate to have more than 10 riders by the year 2025 thus creating employment and reducing poverty in the community.
