> Title of the innovation

Ultra Modern Aerial Gondola Transit System (Ariel Cable Car System)

> Brief description of the innovation

An aerial cable car transit system is a form of technology that carries transportation pods known as gondolas attached to cables which extend over various distances and is used by commuters as an alternative form of transportation to the conventional forms that are already in existence for example buses and or rail.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This technology will generate income through transportation charges that will be paid as fairs by commuters on a daily basis. The number of commuters is expected to range from 500 - 1000 passengers per hour mainly during peak hours.

The technology will significantly revolutionize the transport sector for lower income commuters as they will no longer have to settle for conventional methods of transportation such as Buses and even more expensive forms of transportation such as taxis. This will guarantee lower traffic jams especially in the central business district of Lusaka and significantly improve pancuality of employees which will result in more efficient operations for businesses at large. 

Unlike conventional motor vehicles, cable car systems are solely dependent on electricity to function which means that it has little to no impact on the environment. Furthermore, as more people gravitate towards this form of transportation, less cars will dominate the roads of the city further lessening our carbon footprint on the planet.

> Technical Feasibility

The technology is designed to transport  gondolas through the air using pods attached to cables that move to and fro by a rotating motor.
An example of this technology that’s in existence today is the urban aerial cable car system that was deployed in Medellin Colombia and is used to connect the lower income urban neighborhoods to the city center. 
The implementation plan is to assign an expert team architects and engineers to design and assess the necessary areas on which this innovation can be implemented. The next step would be to get the relevant permits from authorities to begin construction. After, the right material as advised by the experts will have to be purchased to begin implementation procedures. As cable car systems are quick to construct due to their lack of engines and reliance on electricity to drive the rotators, functionality can begin as soon as construction is completed.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Due to Lusaka’s lack of infrastructure tourism, this will give the city much needed exposure and as a result, it will push businesses and even the government to invest in the communities surrounding the cable car system to accommodate both local and international tourists and thus improve the lives of various surrounding communities in the city as evidenced by the improvement of lower income neighborhoods in the city of Medellin Colombia as a result of the implementation of this technology.
