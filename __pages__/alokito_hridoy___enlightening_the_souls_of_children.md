Alokito Hridoy (meaning enlightened soul in Bengali) is an educational NGO based in Bangladesh that provides quality education for children.  The root cause of discrepancies in the job market lies in the early years of education. Children are crammed into a factory model that fails to prepare them for jobs that are yet to exist. To break this vicious cycle with a human-centric approach, Alokito Hridoy wanted to be more aware of how, where and who they piloted their first intervention with. They selected the children of factory workers in Tangail, Mirzapur, as their sample population and started conducting research to understand them better through a number of focused group discussions, home visits and interviews. Despite being blue-collar workers, the factory workers dreamed of prestigious, white-collar jobs for their children. To advance their dreams, Alokito Hridoy launched a low cost charter school 50 kilometers away from Dhaka in Tangail, Mirzapur. They started gathering evidence in the school to gradually address the problems in the education system. They came up with one solution after another to provide education that is relevant for now and the future. Gradually, they came up with an education model rooted in empathy, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. They are improving the quality of education by preparing children with social, moral, emotional and cognitive skills to be adaptive, proactive and innovative problem solvers. The learning style is inquiry based: learning by playing, problem solving and inquiring. The initiative started the school with 100 students in Tangail, Mirzapur, about 50 kilometers north of Dhaka. The first year they educated students up to grade 3, all children of industrial workers. They are now educating 200 children up to grade 7 - their goal is to grow with the students and add a new grade each year. The school has a nominal fee, which adds a sense of accountability to the community and parents. A portion of Home Junctions sales, a retail outlet for home goods, goes to support Alokito Hridoy School. Alokito Hridoy knew from the start that a building is not the heart of a school, but rather it is the teachers. Hence they hire local teachers since they are the most knowledgeable about the area and the context. Teachers have an impact on students when they connect with them and are interested to learn more about them. Alokito Hridoy invest heavily in teacher training to nurture and empower them as the empathetic, 21st century facilitators and the catalyst of change in the school and community. The teacher training approaches have expanded beyond the walls of Alokito Hridoy. They have partnered with the government, non-government and private schools to work on teacher development in primary and secondary education. Their training modules are designed for Bangla, English, Madrasah medium schools across the country and has the potential to bridge these silos with the hope of ensuring access to quality education for all.
