## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



(1) THE POTENTIAL OF AN ECOSYSTEM BASED ON RELATIONAL LINKS: The creation and adoption of an international legally binding instrument for the elimination of plastic waste can be a key driver for promoting actions on a national and subnational level to reduce plastic waste. To prepare for this international negotiating process —and the instrument’s adoption in the country further down the line— it is helpful to weave a network of actors and allies across sectors. 

(2) FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR RESPONSIBILITY: Holding spaces for dialogue that lead to self-recognition and the recognition of others —of the roles, responsibilities, solutions, etc. that each actor across different aisles has— helps to promote the reframing of a systemic problem to create a more fertile ground for change, especially when it comes to contested topics such as strategies and actions for reducing plastic pollution.  

(3) COMBATING MARINE POLLUTION THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DATA, REGULATION AND RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION: It is important to establish regulations and policies that limit the use of plastics and promote changes in consumption habits to reduce the generation of plastic waste. Also, a better capacity to identify and quantify plastic pollution sources is essential for strategic policies. 

(4) IT’S NOT ABOUT PLASTIC USAGE, IT’S ABOUT PLASTIC USERS: When devising strategies and actions to reduce plastic pollution, mitigation strategies to alleviate its impact in people’s livelihoods must be considered (for example, provide alternatives for plastic fishing nets for fishers, etc.). Likewise, plastics impact on vulnerable communities must be always analyzed and considered.

The learnings from this cycle are informing the government’s (Foreign Affairs Ministry) position in the ongoing process for the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment —the next session (INC-3) will be held in November 2023 in Kenya.  

 

So far, the learnings informed the creation of a report of the participatory dialogues, which was shared with actors from the ecosystem. Additionally, the participatory dialogues designed by the Lab and implemented with the Foreign Affairs Ministry are inspiring other countries in the region to hold similar participatory processes, such as Brazil —Mexico was the only country to implement participatory processes for INC-2.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



The dialogues contributed to inform the perspectives, challenges, and opportunities related to plastic pollution of a diverse group of participants and the type of data selected assisted in creating a more granular understanding of how the subject was understood on the ground and offer an opportunity for empathy and sensemaking. As negotiations for an international binding treaty on plastic pollution just started in 2022, the dialogues addressed the identified gap of how people from different sectors can inform the problem through perspective beyond the public lens.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



The dialogues included the participation of NGOs, academia, private sector, and government, all with different understandings of the matter. The method allowed for the diversity of voices to be recognized and focus on constructive exercises for deepening on the participations, rather than permitting the refutation of perspectives and arguments.  
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summons multi-sector stakeholders to inform the position of Mexico for the Intergovernmental Negotiation Committee for the creation of a legally binding instrument for the elimination of plastic waste and UNDP, as leader of the United Nations System workgroup on Green Economy and Climate Change, coordinated the UN participation in the dialogues. More specifically, the Lab’s role was to design and facilitate participatory dialogues with civil society, youth and public in general to capture their perceptions around the elimination of plastic waste.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



The combination helped us and our government counterpart to have a more systemic and local understanding of how people “on the ground” are experiencing and perceiving the challenge of plastic pollution.
