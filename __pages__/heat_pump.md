> Description of the solution

Heat pumps help improve air quality and reduce GHG emissions compared to conventional heating technologies. A heat pump uses technology similar to that found in an air conditioner. It extracts heat from a source, such as the surrounding air, geothermal energy stored in the ground, or nearby sources of water or waste heat from a factory. Because most of the heat is transferred rather than generated, heat pumps are far more efficient than conventional heating technologies such as boilers or electric heaters. Households with a heat pump also spend less on energy than those using a gas boiler. In addition, a large‚Äêscale switch to heat pumps can prevent other risks associated with fossil fuel combustion such as carbon monoxide from poorly serviced heating stoves and gas boilers.

On finance:
Many countries (particularly in Europe) subsidize heat pumps to increase affordability.
