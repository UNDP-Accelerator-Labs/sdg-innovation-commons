> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Pisonets are standalone internet kiosks that operate by inserting Php1.00 coins in exchange for 5 minutes of internet use. We observed that most users access their Facebook accounts and watch YouTube videos. Pisonets are made by assembling old cannibalized computer parts, CRT / LCD monitor, a digital coin slot & timer.  In a nutshell, these are decentralized internet cafes.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

The need to have affordable internet to those without a smartphone or a computer.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

The solution is for the general public, mostly those in the youth sector.  Users usually use the solution to access social media sites and entertainment sites such as YouTube.

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

This means that access to computers and the internet is still a great challenge for people.  Just like the PisoWiFi, this is a basic form of the sharing economy where the poor can have access to a computer and the internet through affordable means.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

This solution is the next evolution of the internet cafe and presents how internet cafes can be decentralized by bringing it to the customers.  There is widespread acceptance by the general public as the arcade game-type design can easily be mobilized and installed in remote areas where there is no access to computers and the internet.
