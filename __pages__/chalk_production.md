SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES:

CHALK FEASIBILITY REPORT AND APPLICATION FOR FINACIAL REQUISITION TO SCALE UP THE EXISTING DUSTLESS CHALK BUSINESS LOCATED AT PLOT NO. 16775/1080 KAMWALA SOUTH LUSAKA- ZAMBIA.

INTRODUCTION
Chalk making is an industry full of opportunities due to growing demand for chalk. Chalk is used in schools and colleges for writing on blackboards, it is also used by tailors, carpenters and furniture markers, surveyors, construction workers, fabricators etc. However, Smart Brain Enterprises have penetrated school on a small scale.
It is relatively easy to make chalk in large quantity because the Start-up costs and requirement are not overwhelming. Chalk making is a viable project and the profitability is very good for discerning investors. 
SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES DESCRIPTION OF CHALK PROJECT 
The project is a small scale manufacturing unit at the moment. The chalk making facilities is a mold with 400 holes and a handmade drier. The production is done at home at the back yard. The raw materials are readily available and very affordable. The project is not affected by electricity at the moment because all the machines are manual.
SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES MARKET DESCRIPTION
Chalk making project has potential contribute to National development and in creating job opportunities for unemployed zambians due to its increased demand in schools. Apparently, in Zambia, there are only two local manufacturing of chalk; SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES and BRIBINAR.  Zambia is using imported chalk from china, Thailand, South Africa etc. SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES branded its chalk brand as smart chalk. This brand of chalk has a low risk of production, high demand and has a good market potential which will contribute to the sustained growth of the industry and become one of the leading chalk producing industry in Zambian. In this vain, SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES believes that with a population of over 14million people and schools (secondary ,primary, tertiary, vocation) and continuing education scattered across Zambia, the demand for chalk will always be there and is expected to double in no time. 
SMART CHALK PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Smart chalk is made out of formulated calcium carbonate , POP and different invented additives which gives its tensile strength, easy to erase and a good surface contact on the chalk board. These formulations are added  in the mold. White and colored smart chalk is made in the similar way.
The smart brain enterprises packaging boxes are made by hand after printing on the industrial printer. 
ORGANIZATION PLAN
SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES is a registered chalk making business which is ran as by Edward Kangombe and his friends. Edward oversees the production function, marketing, personal management and other miscellaneous function of the business. It is registered with PACRA. It is for this reason that smart brain seeks an investor /grant to invest in this profitable chalk business in order to grow the business.However, smart has planned to build a machine that will increase production and drying period in order to meet the demand.
MARKETING PLAN
The smart brain has identified schools, wholesalers and retailing outlets where smart chalk is supplied and sold on retail and wholesale price. The other strategy developed is identifying new customers such as bookshops and design a method of selling the products across the country. However, smart brain intend to compete favorably with foreign competitors by appropriately pricing Smart Chalk. Apparently, the international chalk brand is selling at K15 and K20 a box of 100 sticks while the smart chalk brand with the same quality is selling at K10 but still profitable. Quality control and pricing is the smart brain strength. 
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Smart brain Enterprises is seeking financial investment of a minimum of K50, 000 to a maximum of K100, 000, in form of a low interest loan or to trade for 15% of the business for sustainable growth and expansion or a Grant.
PROJECT FINANCE.
DRYER Fabrication 			      K20, 000.
Extruder Fabrication                          K 20,000.
Packaging boxes 					K10, 000.
Raw material 					K10 000.
Labor, transport and other logistics: K15 000.

 SALES FORECAST
One thing is certain when it comes to Smart brain chalk production business. The business is strategically positioned and easily accessible. It will always attract customers, cum sales and it will surely translate to increase in revenue generation for the business.
Smart brain is well positioned also to take on available markets in other countries in Africa and beyond where we intend to export our brands. Smart brain team is quite optimistic that it will meet the set targets of generating profits from the first six months of operation and grow the business and the clientele base.
Smart Brain Enterprises is a business that has critically examined the chalk production and analyzed the chances in the business and has come up with a sales forecast below;
The sales are based on the information gathered during its operation in the field of its prototype Smart chalk.
Smart brain Enterprises chalk production sales projection is based on the production which was done  of a small scale operation of two tons of raw material .The annual projection be as follows:
o	First fiscal year;       K1, 200,000.
o	Second fiscal year; K3, 600,000.
o	Third fiscal year       K8, 400,000.
N.B; This projection is based on the sales of 250kgs of raw material which was processed as Smart Brain prototype chalk and what is obtainable in the industry with assumption that there won’t be any major economic meltdown. 
Please note that the projection might be lower and at the same time, higher if the operation are done at a very small scale.
SWOT ANALYSIS
Smart Brain enterprises has the drive for excellence when it comes to running a standard chalk production business. Smart brain enterprises engaged the market and finest business consultants in Lusaka and beyond to look through the business concept and together we were able to conclude that the smart chalk has the potential to compete favorably in the line of chalk production in Africa and beyond.
In this view, smart brain enterprises, is able to take stock of its strength, weakness, opportunities and threats that it is likely going to be exposed to in Zambia and in other parts of the world in which smart brain intend to penetrate with smart chalk.
Here is what SMART BRAIN ENTERPRISES got from the critically conducted SWOT Analysis;
Strength:
Invention of environmentally friendly additives and low production cost which are positioned to meet the demand of chalk in Zambia once operations kick off.
Another factor that counts to smart brain enterprises is the advantage of being run by a scientific inventor and a Teacher who understand the health requirements of a classroom environment and public health care. The proprietor has a wide sales and communication skills spanning from his past experience as a sales executive of one of the largest insurance companies in Zambia and above all dedication is not exceptional.
WEAKNESS:
Smart Brain enterprises does not take an advantage of the fact that the entity has weaknesses, in fact smart brain is setting up a chalk production business in the country where chalk product is dominated by foreign countries such as china, Thailand, South Africa which pose a challenge for us to break into the already saturated market. This can slow done penetration and a small market share. Nevertheless, smart brain has plans to launch out a huge bang. Smart chalk has created a positive impression on the market.
OPPORTUNITIES:
The opportunities available to Smart Brain Enterprises are unlimited. Loads of people use chalk on a daily basis and Smart Brain Enterprises will push the smart chalk to them. Smart Brain Enterprises has vast readily available market across Zambia.
THREATS:
The threat that is likely going to confront us is the fact that we are competing with already established foreign chalk production businesses in Zambia and also there are other entrepreneurs who are likely going to launch similar business within the location of our business.
Of course, they will compete with us in winning over the available market. Another threat that we are likely going to face is unfavorable government policies and economic downturn. Usually economic downturn affects purchasing/spending powers.
