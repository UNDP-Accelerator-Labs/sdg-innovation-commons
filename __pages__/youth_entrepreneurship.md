Our challenge is that the youth precipitation in Libya's entrepreneurship programs is considered to be remarkably low, especially from rural areas.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Most of the fighters in Libya are from the young generation. Especially from rural areas and therefore, the AccLab in Libya is interested in supporting the youth in the rural areas in navigating business opportunities and developing their areas.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The increase in youth entrepreneurship activities (especially in rural areas) creates more jobs, creativity, and products diversity. And reduce the immigration to big cities.
