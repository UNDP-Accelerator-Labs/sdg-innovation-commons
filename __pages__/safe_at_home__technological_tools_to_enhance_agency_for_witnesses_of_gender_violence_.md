Safe at Home: Technological Tools to Enhance Agency for Witnesses of Gender Violence.


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to reduce the risk of domestic violence suffered by women in Mexico City with the incorporation of technological tools that bring relevant information and practical tools to people close to the phenomenon of violence (neighbors, relatives, etc.) to leverage their proximity with domestic violence and turn them into agents of change.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Gender Unit at Mexico’s UNDP Country Office leads an effort along with Mexico City’s Government to improve public services concerning gender violence during the Covid outbreak. Gender violence is a multifactored problem that needs involvement by everyone around it to be solved. Women’s close circle of friends, family, and neighbors can play a key role in solving the issue of helping women escape the circle of violence.



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Confinement measures and social distancing, as well as mobility restrictions are generating increased risks of violence against women and girls, intensifying their isolation and generating additional barriers in access to essential services. In Mexico, 43.9% of women 15 years and older have experienced violence from their partner or husband, which makes the domestic environment a precarious context. According to the National Institute of Women, 911 calls to report violence against women increased over 31%. According to UN Women, less than 40% of women who are victims of violence seek assistance and less than 10% reach out to authorities.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The containment measures derived from COVID19 show a negative effect on gender-based violence through two main channels. On the one hand, by increasing the time that women at risk of violence spend with their aggressors, due to confinement. On the other hand, by increasing the vulnerability of women at risk of violence who lose their income because of the economic downturn.




</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Including the inner circle of women who suffer domestic violence in the prevention and attention of this phenomenon holds great potential. The Accelerator Lab's methodology is a great vehicle for addressing this issue step by step: The cycle begins with a sensemaking phase of the challenges faced by women’s inner circle to help victims escape violence, what role do they play, what can they do, which tools can they use and what areas of opportunity we find to incorporate this into a digital solution. The next step is to explore alternatives in search of a set of viable prototype solutions. The prototypes will be tested to assess their effectiveness. Finally, once there is evidence about what works better, a proposal will be made to integrate and grow the solution in the work of the Secretary of Women who works in favor of improving women’s lives, with whom we have already collaborated before.



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

When women are confined at their homes and suffer violence, their inner circles of family, friends, and neighbors are an important opportunity to address it and stop it through tools, knowledge, and other resources.
