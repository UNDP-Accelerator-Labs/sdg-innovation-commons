> [Hypothesis: IF ... THEN ...]

If a person previously separates its household waste and leaves it separated before garbage collection, then the garbage collector will keep it separated when picking it up.

> 

- Pre-experiment (probe, trial & error)

> [Solution to be designed and tested]

Household garbage classification

> [Description of the experiment methodology]

Separate the garbage of the house using at least three categories: carton/paper, glass, and plastics. Put each one in a different plastic bag. Then, put the classified bags outside of the house and wait and see what does the garbage collector do. Observe and annotate whether the garbage collector keeps the bags divided or mixes them up. Take pictures or videos only if it is not intrusive. Annotate ideas and insights. Don't talk directly to the collector, just watch and learn.

> [Resources required: financial, human, or other]

Household garbage, garbage bags, garbage collector, cellphone or camera

No additional comments.

> Experiment quality check

- Relevant to a CPD outcome
- Clearly stated hypothesis
- Methodology is clear
- Low risk

> [Key results]

The garbage truck does not go inside the street's house. Instead, on behalf of the truck, a collector man goes throughout the street with a medium cart to pick up the neighbors’ garbage bags. When the collector picked up the bags, he joined them into one. He did not keep the bags separated. Next, he put that one mixed bag on top of the others ones on the cart. 

> [Key insights]

Since the collector has to use a cart for moving the garbage maybe it is easier for him to merge the bags. We wonder whether he separates the bags again once he is back at the main garbage truck. We also ask ourselves if this is a common practice in other areas of the city. What do other garbage collectors do when they find separated garbage on their routes? Are there any garbage collectors who do keep separated the garbage and why? 

> [Notes on the methodology after its use]

We could do a second trial of the experiment and in addition to the observation we could talk to the garbage collector and ask whether he considers the separated garbage is useful and if so, why and to whom is it useful?

> [Time it took to implement]

1 day

> [Follow up]

We will try to invite country office colleagues to replicate the experiment at their homes and record their results and insights in order to see how experiences vary throughout the city.

> [Name of the portfolio of experiments]

Socioeconomic incentives for improving solid waste management 

> [Frontier challenge and learning question]

How to increase resilience to climate change? How to incentivize waste management?
