This solution uses mobile, satellite and open data in order to better understand state-level depopulation trends. It focuses on in-country distribution of population and migrations, based on analysis of activity, connectivity and mobility of people in Serbia reflected through telecom data together with data from different sources. The results of the research are easily accessible through a web portal, which will include interactive maps, dashboards, and customized reports.
