Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and in consultation with the locals, devised a portfolio of solutions to promote sustainable tourism in CHT.  One key problem identified is that there is a lack of trained tour guides who can cater to the different needs of tourists. To address this, trainings could be provided to tour guides. These would include high quality training on issues such as first aid, waste management options, skill training for informal workers etc. Location specific training for specific spots could also be provided taking into context the local culture. Do's and don'ts should be part of the training module. Specialised training should be provided to manage tourists with special needs, e.g., people with disabilities. The picture shows a training session organized by the Accelerator lab on emergency first aid.
