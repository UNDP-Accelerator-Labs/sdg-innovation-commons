## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Water scarcity and shortage in Rodrigues needs increased attention if resilience is to be built in food systems 2. High dependency on food importation across all three islands is a barrier to local food production as it introduces competition (prices are generally cheaper for imported)  3. Organic certification is costly - there is a need to develop a local certification to remove barriers for organic farmers to sell their products  4. Young people do not want to do jobs in agriculture  5. Agro-forestry - especially for Seychelles - is potentially an emerging sector

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Barriers related to availability of data  Barriers related to achieving effective partnerships  Bottlenecks include managing many priorities at once at the CO level therefore not being able to fully develop the frontier challenge 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

For Rodrigues, we opted for 'citizen-generated' data as there is little availability of official data.  For Seychelles, we opted for informal conversations and ethnographic data. For Mauritius, we used a mix of different datasets to understand food systems. Data gaps include satellite and geospatial data (water sources, Rodrigues).

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It was relatively easy. For example, we introduced system mapping as a way to deconstruct food systems in Mauritius. Our partners appreciated the holistic approach that helped to connect dots between isolated interventions. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with associations, that are registered as civil society organisations. They were very helpful in connecting us to communities of farmers they work with. They have the direct link with grassroots communities. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We are working with the University of Mauritius - they have been able to help by supporting our work with their interested students. We have no formal agreement. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Private sector partners include foundations and we are working with them to scope the design possibilities for the gamified quiz we want to design.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We are working with the FAREI (research institute). With them we are able to access technical support on the science around food systems. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Associations (FALCON, Regeneration Mauritius, Seychelles Farmers' Association and Val D'En Dor Farmers Associaiton)

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

As part of a Joint SDG Fund Programme on Food Security, we have been able to collaborate (in the early scoping stage) with UN Women and FAO. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay of these methods helped us to get trust and buy in from national partners as they saw these methods as novel ones that they could also tap into.
