Based on the concept 'waste to wealth', the project aims to produce high-value wooden craft products and decorations. The wood is sourced from woods of small diameter that comes from the thinning of teak wood farms. This small-diameter wood is usually known as 'kayu jaras' and is often thrown away or turned into firewood. 
The Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) has successfully organised a community programme in the effort to include the local communities in the research and development (R&D) output, particularly on the use, processing, and value-added production process from the thinning of the teak wood farm. 
The community-inclusive impact programme for the initial phase (2019-2020) of the programme was successfully implemented under the 11th Malaysia Plan (RMK11). The programme was also supported by the Malaysian Handicraft Development Corporation (Perlis branch), and the State of Perlis' Department of Forestry. 
The communities that participated in the programme were exposed to the various uses of and skills to make the handicrafts. Today, the cooperative effort has led to the pioneering of highly-skilled creative artists and woodcarvers among the communities in Perlis.
