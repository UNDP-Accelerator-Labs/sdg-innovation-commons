> Title of the innovation

Agriculture through fish farming, animal rearing and crop vegetables inclusive for sustainable living

> Brief description of the innovation

The Innovation is about agriculture, both animal and crop. Rearing of chicken (poultry),;fish farming and animal husbandry.
The , innovation would be made possible by the provision of a water source such as a borehole. The agriculture innovation project is dependent on water, as crop farming will run through out the year. The orchard, banana plantation will be better off with plenty of water. The innovation, as a project running more than one activity, will need the installation of energy, this will power the activities through out the day and night. A variety of equipment and tools also need to be provided for the smooth running of the farm activities. Human resources, and skilled is also vital for the success of the innovation. In addition, regular supervision is the most necessary as it calls for commitment and accurate results of the products.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income is the major source of my innovation. Personally, it would meet my expenses and those of my family. As a single mother, I will be able to cushion for education, health and shelter expenses. As caretaker to my mother whose healthy is monitored, the innovation will play the role of relief to a single handed hustler. The innovation will also result in other business ventures as well as projects. Thus, resulting in a good source of income. The innovation would also result in employment of other persons, whose lives will change as they will be able to earn a living, for example, take their children to school, feed their families well
 If we'll implemented, the innovation may also help other individuals to be independent as they take up such innovations, after acquiring knowledge, vastly, through this innovation. This innovation, at the same time would help the well being of others in terms of accessing a good education, health, clean water and shelter. The innovation, can result in good supplies at local, national or international, whose implication would be developed society at it's different levels.

> Technical Feasibility

The need of tools and equipment, farming, is the genesis of my innovation. This applies to both animal and crop. Orchard, banana plantation and vegetable growing would be given first priority. With the sinking of the bore hole, fish farming will come in as well as other animals. The green vegetation would save as food to the animal life, and like wise, the animal waste as food to the plant life. The products will have the market within and outside my community. The more products I sell, the bigger the innovation becomes, resulting in more imputs. At this level, more man power will be employed for better results, also the market has to be expanded beyond my community, for instance, supplies would be made to credible institutions. A farm house at this stage has to be built for closer supervision as more time has to be spent on the innovation. At this stage, crops such as soya beans, groundnuts, cassava can be grown at a large scale. Crop rotation will be the order of this innovation while conservation farming will be put to use.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve the lives of others through job creation, food supply for all, and improve the health standards
The proposed innovation is relevant in the sense that it is very goal oriented and ready for the intended market in terms of supplies in various ways, such as food, source of manure and others.
