Social Tension Early Warning System | Horizon 360

## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



“Our challenge is that current systems lack the capacity for real-time monitoring of social tensions, comprehensive needs assessments, and centralized knowledge management. This limitation hampers our ability to proactively respond to emerging threats and effectively plan interventions in Syria’s fragile socio-economic environment.”



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



History and Drivers:

The challenge originates from the limitations of existing systems that are unable to provide real-time and accurate monitoring of social tensions in Syria. This deficiency is driven by a lack of integration and coordination among various data sources and methodologies currently in use. The systems in place are not equipped to harness modern technological capabilities such as AI-driven analytics and comprehensive data aggregation, which are essential for timely and predictive insights into social dynamics and potential conflicts.



Involved Parties:

The parties involved include UNDP’s Strategic Policy Unit, field staff, local authorities, community members, international partners, and donors. Each group plays a specific role in gathering, analyzing, and responding to data, but the effectiveness of their efforts is hindered by the disjointed nature of existing systems.



Current Situation:

Currently, the systems for monitoring social tensions are fragmented and lack the capability to provide a unified, real-time view of emerging risks. Similarly, needs assessments are often siloed and do not fully integrate the insights and input from local communities, especially marginalized and vulnerable groups. This results in interventions that may not be fully aligned with the actual needs on the ground.



Undesired Effects:

The primary undesired effect of these challenges is the increased likelihood of escalating tensions due to missed opportunities for early intervention. When emerging risks are not promptly or accurately identified, preventive actions cannot be taken, potentially leading to conflicts that could have been mitigated or avoided. Additionally, the lack of effective participatory needs assessments means that recovery and development efforts may not effectively address the most pressing community needs, leading to less efficient use of resources and reduced impact of interventions.
