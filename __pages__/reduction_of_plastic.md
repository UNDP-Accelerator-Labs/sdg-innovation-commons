## Title

Reduction of Plastic Pollution in Trinidad and Tobago
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that government, private companies and households in Trinidad and Tobago produce excessive volumes of plastic waste despite the widespread realization that there is a need to reduce inordinate plastic use (especially of single use plastics).

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Caribbean has been labeled the “The Biggest Plastic Polluters Per Capita In The World”. According to world statistics, ten of the thirty top per capita global plastic polluters are from the Caribbean region, based on per capita plastic pollution. Most Caribbean countries depend on tourism as their main revenue and as such, plastic pollution represents a significant threat to livelihood and economies of the Caribbean. Within the Caribbean region, Trinidad and Tobago is identified as the 6th highest plastic polluter within the region. With no recycling facility on the island as well as limited collection, the country ranks 5th in the world for per capita production of mismanaged waste. Despite its negative connotation and impacts, plastic pollution offers opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in the development of upcycled products.  Innovation will be needed to address the challenge posed by the overuse of plastic and the excessive production of plastic pollution. Such innovation can assume many forms, ranging from returning to more traditional ways of packaging items to reduce plastic, to using plastic waste to create energy such as combustion, gasification and pyrolization and the development of new bio-compatible material to replace conventional single use plastics. Innovation may use advanced science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) or non-STEM based activities involving behavioral changes and new ways of thinking about plastic. In practice, the distinction between types of innovation in reality is never clear-cut. Consider, for instance, the fact that new behaviors in waste management often center around the three R’s, reduce, recycle and reuse, but also include upcycling as a class of recycling where waste can be subjected to an engineering or other process that generates new items of higher value or quality than the original inputs. Dealing with the challenge of plastic pollution will therefore require combining diverse innovation approaches.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Qualitative evidence that served as signals for this challenge include:
Physical evidence of large volumes of plastic waste on beaches and in water courses.
The proliferation of citizen-led clean-up activities, such as The Green Circle (The Green Circle EC | Facebook), political party UNC beach clean-up, volunteer beach clean-up activities, among other. The number of volunteers and the funding provided through corporate CSR also served as a signal. At a single government clean-up activity, there were more than 200 volunteers; and at the community-led clean-up activity there was also a very large number of people.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Value proposition of Accelerator Lab: The Accelerator Lab used a collective and collaborative approach to generating solutions that encompass unusual, non-traditional stakeholders and interest groups. These approaches to solution design are somewhat new to the UNDP, and when utilized, serve to generate more innovative and targeted solutions. For instance, the Lab engaged the small rural NGOs, large social movements like the Catholic Commission for Social Justice, The University of the West Indies, unaffiliated small companies and innovators, and CSR service providers such as Nestle Ltd, the supermarket association of Trinidad and Tobago, and government actors specialized in waste management. Our partner for this challenge was the GEF SGP, which was allocated funding for addressing plastic pollution. 


Why it is worth investing resources in this challenge: This is needed in Trinidad and Tobago; the challenge is longstanding and will attract funding into the long-term. It will therefore be possible to scale-up successful solutions over the long term. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP and GEF SGP have partnered to fund YOUR innovative solutions to the problem plastic pollution in Trinidad and Tobago. Replace plastic with safe materials, turn waste plastic into something new and change the way people think about plastic!

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The Accelerator Lab convened stakeholder meetings and facilitated solution-oriented sessions to identify potential interventions for reducing plastic pollution. GEF SGP and their Steering Committee identified and funded the solutions up to a value of USD150K, total. Solutions were identified in the sequestration of plastic waste in concrete for buildings, the creation of a model and demonstration facility of a circular plastic community and repurposing of waste plastic into filaments for 3D printers by persons with disabilities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What non-government solutions are there to plastic waste in Trinidad and Tobago that can be easily adopted by small NGOs/CSO and householders. 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

From stakeholder meetings and cocreation sessions hosted by the Accelerator Lab, the GEF SGP was able to select 4 solutions for funding which will be tested for scale-up at a national level.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We always need good data on the amount of waste and specifically plastic waste generated by different industries and players in Trinidad and Tobago. This can contextualize the solutions that we have identified i.e. clarify how impactful. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Rural close-knit communities & supermarket and food packaging subsectors. We already have some relationship with the government and academia. These need to be carefully maintained over time for scale-up and maximum impact.
