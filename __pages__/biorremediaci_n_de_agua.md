Innovators: Universidad Nacional Santiago Antúnez de Mayolo Río Santa Ana community members (Canrey chico) Instituto de Montaña Rivers and other sources of water which farmers and communities depend on are polluted or have been negatively impacted from mining. Heavy metals in water poses an important threat to health and the environment. The Río Santa community in Perú has been trained in: analizing its water sources with the use of simple technological devices and use a filter system which consists of different water ponds with filtering plants and rocks. Polluted water travels and passes by filtering ponds and levels before arriving to farms or before community use. Communities chose the filtering plants to be used, which generate a bacteria that reduces metal pollution. Water becomes usable for agricultural purposes (not drinking).
