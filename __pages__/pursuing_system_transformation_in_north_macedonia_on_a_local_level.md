## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Pursuing System Transformation in North Macedonia on a local level by developing a portfolio of options approach via the City Experimentation fund  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge statement is to find out the extent to which we can use the ‘system transformation approach’ to bring the needed changes including innovation, novel ideas, and new partnerships to tackle city challenges. In these 100 days we are entering portfolio design and then the activation stage. Hence, we will first design a portfolio of interventions and then test it on small scale in the capital city. The activation stage is conditioned on many preconditions such as the city’s willingness to adopt the portfolio.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

On the issue of the sluggish economy, we explored and learned in the previous 100 days about the central challenges of the City of Skopje through a process of deep listening. The micronarratives that occurred in this process talked about the need to pursue interventions in the realm of circular economy and creating a portfolio of options that would improve the current situation [the ecosystem currently has limited success stories in the realm of circularity]. We chose the theme of waste management as a central one and are now developing a portfolio of options in which we will identify few small-scale experiments for introducing circular economy within some parts of the city. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

In our research stages of the CEF project we considered the national waste management plan 2018-2024 and the shift to circular economy policies and practices. However, this plan is created on a level of a country not on a city level. The plan focuses on several key enablers - clear and effective legislation, strong institutional capacity and infrastructure delivery, high quality waste data and extended producer responsibility, however the extend of which is not backed up by official documents nor strategies that we are aware of at the moment. In terms of waste streams, the plan prioritizes the following streams:  Municipal waste  Commercial & Industrial wastes  Construction & Demolition waste  Hazardous waste  Clinical & Healthcare waste  Sewage sludge  For the portfolio design we choose a topic of waste that citizens are creatinged..   In a recent report done for UNDP CO MK, the consulting company Dwaste mentioned that there are six possible waste streams for circularity in Macedonia which have not been exploited by the central nor local government. In the report it was assessed that applying circular practices to six selected waste streams can deliver, by 2030: • 951 Gg CO2eq/year GHGs savings comparing to 2016 • 2,740 new jobs • 47.17 million EUR of economic benefits That means that the shift to circular practices, even if it is restricted to those six case studies, is enough to counterbalance the emissions from solid waste disposal (almost double savings), and the emissions from the Waste and Industrial Processes and Product Use sectors. To achieve these benefits, a shift in governance practices is required.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The AccLab team, helped with the CO expertise from portfolio managers and two interns, one onboarding in second part of April, is the “engine” team behind the creation of portfolio of interventions that will be delivered to the city of Skopje and that will be tested on small scale within some parts of the city. We are hoping that this project will be an excellent platform on which we will build coherency withing the portfolios of the CO as we are building on the environmental unit’s know –how on circularity (DWaste report), good governance unit’s good municipal practices, and the social inclusion unit which has interest in creating jobs in the circular economy area.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are working on systems transformation on a local level through exploring circularity as an option for boosting our economy.  We are testing portfolio of options in the domain of circular economy, and questioning how the capital city can be more resilient to outside events such as a pandemic if circularity is achieved in biowaste, plastic etc.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can we design a portfolio of options for achieving circularity within the waste management area.  Can we establish unconventional partnerships with organizations that are working with circular economy in the city of Skopje either by accelerating their efforts or establishing better practices that can be easily implemented and tested.   

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Using these 5 innovative methods, but also not limiting only to them, we would like to design new types of processes and activities, that will bring the spirit of the Accelerator Lab into the programming of our Country Office as well as in the activities we are organizing with our partners.   For the City Experimentation Fund, we are using ethnographic research, sensemaking through deep listening and the portfolio approach, to develop activities in the realm of circular economy on a city level, and work towards a system transformation approach on a local level.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no systematic collection of data, thus the available data has many gaps, and inconsistencies; to add to the complexity the data available cannot be compared at all time as the methods of collection where different on various instances. We mostly rely on secondary data analysis in many instances, as this proves to guide us better in the work we do and can help us understand the challenges of the processes better. At the moment, we are exploring the possibilities to fill this data gaps with experts on the subjects. A city-wide market research effort will be initiated to collect primary data for the possibilities of achieving circularity.   It is important to note that this ecosystem is very vibrant, and changes happen rapidly in terms of new initiatives, and developments. Updated data sets can very quickly be changed, as there are partnerships between the waste sector and businesses sector are working hand in hand in few areas (especially where profit margins are higher).
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The potential grow phase is that the portfolio of options that we will develop for the circular economy can be experimented by portfolio of interventions by the Accelerator Lab and then expanded upon with new options and then scaled up by the city administration.   There are grassroot successful initiatives that have the potential to grow. With systematic diagnosis and overcoming the barriers these initiatives can be upscaled successfully. The economic incentives remain the driving force behind these initiatives.   Overall, there is awareness on the importance of the circularity of waste, especially among the highly educated and citizens living in urban areas. There is also a very strong sense of the neighborhood concept in the city of Skopje that could be used to harvest the development of the small ecosystems to test, pilot and experiment new initiatives.
