A detailed spatial and socio-economic profile of the Serbian diaspora worldwide will be developed. It will be done in part by hiring members from the diaspora, leveraging their networks but also softly connecting them to Serbia. This will enable a more in-depth understanding of Global Serbia and generate material to both support research, as well as helping to fuel a wider debate about membership and meaning of the Global Serbian community. It will also enable the development of a dedicated high-level network and contact forum for major figures in the Serbian diaspora, including politicians, philanthropists, writers, artists and media. It will promote major initiatives in all areas – economic, political, cultural - relevant to Serbia’s national and international interests and reputation. A two-way communications channel with the diaspora will be central to this engagement. Finally, it will provide the basis for the implementation of an Emigrant Support Programme, detailed in a separate proposal.
