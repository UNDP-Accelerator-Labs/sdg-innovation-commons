## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



Based on the intelligence generated, a set of insights and recommendations were drafted:

a) Improve Finance

• Promote an open market for the energy sector, capable of stimulating a sustainable balance between public and private agencies and intervention. Sustained by an attractive enabling environment for investment that can offer trust and liability to external investors and donors, including reducing risks and evaluating conditions, improving processes, and making them more accessible and transparent.

Establish a Rural Electrification Fund, exploring diverse financing alternatives. Rural Electrification cannot be seen as an investment but as a cost for the short-term since it is a development issue and social priority, key to unlock the SDGs.

Improve the public finance landscape for the energy sector, including budget planning and allocation mechanisms. Work on new financing mechanisms tailored for small and medium energy companies – commercial banks and other funding institutions.

b) Increase Coordination

Enhance coordination mechanisms within the public sector, both at central and local level, for joint program design, budgeting, and implementation, especially between the productive sectors, including the design of cross-sectoral programs specially focusing on rural issues from a systemic perspective. Alignment with environmental protection should be present at all stages.

Increase the participation of Communities in planning and decision making and increase communication and sensibilization initiatives. Integrated planning, bringing together Development partners such as the World Bank, African Development Bank, UNDP, USAID, and others, could benefit the alignment of initiatives and optimization of resources for more effective implementation.

c)Build Capacity

Accelerate and support the transfer of competencies to the local level, emphasizing training and capacity building for local authorities Support to make public companies financially healthy, including capacity building (financial, administrative, monitoring, reporting, and planning, considering the sustainability of the works and infrastructure) and compliance mechanisms.

Improve local level capacity in the energy sector, including specific technical and professional training in the rural areas, to ensure services. 

Capacitation and sensibilization of the communities as final end-users and consumers of energy.

d) Support Innovation

Experiment and pilot new independent, autonomous, and off grid means and solutions for rural electrification. Facilitation and incentive for the installation of off-grid independent systems could offer a solution as the grid will only be able to reach in the distant future. The Renewable independent systems piloting and expansion should not be seen as competing with grid expansion, instead it should be looked at as both complementary or as the most viable solution to mitigate the difficulties of rural communities and agriculture.

Capacitation of the engineering fields education, and especially technical and professional training centers both at central and local level, including updated curricula aligned with the future of work and new technologies. 

Foster the emergence and growth of local energy start-ups, that can bring new technologies and solutions to the market. Support R&amp;D functions in Academia and private sector.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



Our work was used to inform a country assessment developed through a GEF project which includes solar energy for 4 agriculture cooperatives. This assessment will also be used as a foundation for joint CO and Ministry of environment projects for renewable energy in the eastern provinces. This work was used as learnings to inform the implementation of TRAC 2 funding installing solar energy in cooperatives in 2 Provinces.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



Data available regarding energy in rural areas is limited and fragmented. No data or information is interconnected and looked at through a systemic view.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



We needed a systems approach, with participative inputs from different stakeholders to have a full picture of the system.
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.



We co-organized joint workshops. This are new partners for the CO. One is a Government and the other is a private sector organization.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



Using a collective intelligence approach through a series of workshops with different stakeholders and methodologies allowed for a bird's eye view of the system and to stimulate dialogue and information sharing. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
