## 

For a contribution of Q50 per month they make up to 2 collections per month (for Q100 we make weekly collections). they take all recyclable material. They ask that the daily recyclable waste be separated in two; Paper and Cardboard on one side and Plastics, Metals, Glass and Tetra pak (without organic waste) on the other. In addition they are also receiving alkaline batteries (you must fill a plastic bottle with them before handing them in), burnt vegetable oil (you must fill a plastic bottle tightly closed before handing them in), electronic waste and tires. They are also receiving clothes, board games and books in good condition.
