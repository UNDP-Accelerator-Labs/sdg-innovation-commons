> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The main purpose of production of an autonomous low-temperature pyrolysis reactor is:

Processing of plastic waste and obtaining fuel gas as a result of processing, which can be used both for household purposes and for driving cars and for fueling in small productions.

Our project serves to solve three problems:

1. Improvement of ecological condition

2. Safe recycling of household, industrial or medical waste

3. Getting cheap fuel gas

The reactor can produce pyrolytic gas 24 hours a day and, in addition to direct supply, can store gas in a reservoir.

The reactor meets several important technical requirements:

1. It is not harmful to the environment.

The reactor has a closed loop and only uses electricity for reaction. does not emit any pollutants into the environment

2. Meets all production and operational safety requirements.

3. Does not require any special training for service personnel

4. It is characterized by high energy efficiency

5. It is ergonomic and compact

6. Through it, it is possible to secure medical waste

recycling.
