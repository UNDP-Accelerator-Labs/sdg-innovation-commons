> Title of the innovation

Agriculture: engaging civil servants who are in rural and remote areas into farming

> Brief description of the innovation

In rural areas civil servants sell most of the maize to FRA therefore if they were given fertilizer on subsidized price they can extend their fields. Coz the fertilizer that we use we buy from the farmers who are given by the government.now imagine if we we can be given our own at least minimum of two heaters each.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Mostly we sell the maizes to the FRA and remain with some to eat. It brings about the community food security and the nation at large.

> Technical Feasibility

Civil servants in these communities should come together and make groups of cooperatives just like the villagers do and start receiving fertilizer. It will even curb on selling of fertilizers by the villagers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There will be food security in our community and Job creation coze here we just hire people to work for us.it will even encourage villagers who like selling fertilizer to doing their own farms coz they will not have any where to sell
