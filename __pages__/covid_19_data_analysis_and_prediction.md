The Corona Quaranteam team consists of over 35 experts and scientists, doctors and epidemiologists from the Balkans, mostly living in the diaspora. They are developing a single website for all countries in the region (Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia) which will offer relevant analyzes of regional data on morbidity and mortality and localization of COVID-19 as well as publish predictions of the situation. The solution would also improve and harmonize the protocols used to treat patients and special groups, and it also provides a part where the team can be approached directly by doctors and experts for help with an analyst.
