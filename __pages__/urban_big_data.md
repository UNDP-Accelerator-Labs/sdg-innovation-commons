URBAN BIG DATA
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the urban planning of the Municipality of El Alto does not have a response to the accelerated growth and demands of the citizens due to the lack of information, of evidence that is relevant to guide public policy and urban planning decisions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Bolivia in recent years presents a new spatial configuration. Population growth has shown a trend towards accelerated urbanization, in particular caused by high rates of migration between rural areas and cities. In 2018, of a total projected population of 11,364,966 Bolivians, 69.5% lived in urban areas. Population projections show that this percentage will reach 75% in 2025 and 80% in 2050 This accelerated growth has been concentrated in the main axis of the country, especially in the city of El Alto, the youngest city in the country that has reached one million inhabitants (current population of the country's seat of government) in a few years. This new spatial and growth configuration of the city generates a difficulty for the municipality in data collection, policy evaluation, design and implementation of territorial urban planning and decision making. As a pioneering alliance to better manage information to plan urban development in the city of El Alto, the Autonomous Municipal Government of El Alto, with the initiative of the solid waste treatment company Trébol S.A. and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Bolivia launched the first Urban Big Data experience, through the Bolivia AccLAB.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

A weak signal is the lack of a database and weak information about the municipality, in this weakness it is very difficult to provide solutions to the demands of the citizens, it cannot be evidenced if the demands were real and if they solve a problem to the city and municipality. The time it takes to provide solutions to the demands generated a lot of complaints and social problems from the neighbors and the municipality.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The accelerated growth of the city deepened the poor urban planning of the municipality, leaving a gap in the data collection, there the presence of the laboratory was of great value to provide a solution that is out of the box, we mapped all the institutions and companies that more a city travels and we show that the garbage collection company is the one that has more data information of the city, in parallel an investigation of an abstract Machine Learning machine for urban planning based on data was mapped, where we articulated this experiment.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Data replicated in real-time, analyzed by experts in the area of planning (Machine Learning), will serve as relevant evidence for decision-making in the area of Mobility, Equipment and Maintenance, understanding absences, deficiencies and trends in the dynamics of the city.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

The use of Data Science can base and guide better decisions in the urban planning of the city?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The experiment, with the support of the garbage collectors and the truck drivers of the garbage collection company, will carry out a survey of information through an interactive application that operates 24/7 which will enable the generation of massive data in real-time. With the agents that generate information, a massive database will be fed for planning and urban development in the city of El Alto.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There was no information or data about the municipality. Even the municipality, neighborhood boards, and the state do not have this information, so these new data sources effectively address this lack of information, which can help citizens, the municipality, and the state.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The municipality of the city of El Alto, urban planning and the citizens of the city
