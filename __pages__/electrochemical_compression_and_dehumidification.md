> Type of the Solution

Technological

> Description of the solution

The electrochemical compressor (EC) is a mass transport device capable of compressing gases via a chemical process, rather than a mechanical one. This can develop efficient not-in-kind energy conversion devices with potential applications in air conditioning and energy storage among others.
