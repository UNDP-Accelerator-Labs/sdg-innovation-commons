> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The RedRen 24 initiative (Renewable Network with Storage 24 hours a day) proposes to generate electricity for isolated towns in an innovative way. The system will consist of a 10 kW photovoltaic generator and a 50/80 kW hydraulic turbine. This involves building and kicking off a photovoltaic solar hybrid generation plant with storage by water pumping with hydraulic power generation. The system is complemented by a medium voltage line for the distribution of renewable energy. This project will change the situation of towns that currently have electricity generation limited to a few hours per day, and will allow people to use electrical and electronic devices that are currently very limited, such as televisions, refrigerators, etc.  The purpose is to carry out a research project that shows the operation of a power generation plant with solar and hydraulic energy that is perfectly replicable in other regions. All this with the great benefit of not generating greenhouse gases. This makes us deeply proud since we will provide benefits to the inhabitants of the Jujuy puna as well as the environment by using the available energies.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Prototype system

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The innovation lies in building a network powered only by renewable energy that will generate the energy needed for four towns 24 hours a day.
