> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

In the Puna region, climate conditions are known to be harsh (with a cold-dry climate, wide thermal amplitude, intense winds and water scarcity), and many times exacerbated by human intervention related to excessive animal grazing and the exploitation of natural resources such as intense consumption of firewood.  This is usually done in inefficient structures like open-air kitchens, holes in kitchen floors or clay ovens. These traditional cooking techniques entail an important use of the already scarce firewood, given its low heat efficiency. Apart from this, the amount of smoke they produce has a detrimental impact on women's health, who are typically the ones working in these kitchens.  Given this situation, this project aims to incorporate appropriate technology into these communities by building ecological ovens and kitchens, installing solar heaters, and building a Trombe wall.   Firstly, the new kitchens will allow to release cooking smoke efficiently and safely and will avoid families from taking the long walk in search of firewood. It also will allow reducing deforestation.  Secondly, solar heaters will take advantage of solar energy to provide families with hot water for hygiene purposes and other uses.   Finally, Trombe walls allow keeping a comfortable temperature inside the home. The construction of a first Trombe wall will be used as a pilot experience to then be replicated in other communities.  Additionally, the project will provide training workshops to boost an active participation from the community. These workshops will contribute to developing habits and attitudes that can contribute to a healthy lifestyle when it comes to renewable energies. The goal is to give value once again to the ancient wisdom of the community in the management of natural resources and to strengthen the territorial governance of the organization.
