## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Many local cities and municipalities lack the requisite technical capacity (innovation skills) for developing sustainable urban innovations.

2. The primary challenge faced by cities in their attempt to solve wicked urban problems is the ability to accurately define public problems and develop data-driven, innovative solutions.

3. More than 80% of the participants in the workshop (development planners and decision makers from the 10 local cities) were new to design thinking/human-centered design and its application to solving problems and developing innovative solutions.

4. Local cities need further capacity strengthening in problem identification, solution design, prototyping and experimentation, proposal development,  and pitching.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

In collaboration with our partners, the Lab intends to make follow-up visits to selected municipalities to assess the viability of their proposed solutions and co-design an action plan to help them test and scale their innovations.
## Data and Methods

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Of 9 cities that applied to the 2021 Global Mayors Challenge, only one was shortlisted by Bloomberg for the Championship phase. Our exploratory engagements with these cities and local governments further highlighted the need for problem-solving and innovation skills to design and implement mission-driven and sustainable urban projects. 

Introducing participants to the latest innovation tools and technologies and using case studies and hands-on exercises to demonstrate the application of design thinking, collective intelligence and business model canvas to solving urban problems has helped to unpack current urban challenges and laid a foundation for developing sustainable innovations.

The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) is a large international network that promotes and strengthens democratic local government to support sustainable development across the Commonwealth and provides a collective voice to advocate for greater empowerment at the local level.

 Through this collaboration, UNDP Ghana, through the Accelerator Lab, worked with CLGF and NALAG to engage development planners and decision makers in ten selected municipalities and metropolises for a 3-day innovation bootcamp.
