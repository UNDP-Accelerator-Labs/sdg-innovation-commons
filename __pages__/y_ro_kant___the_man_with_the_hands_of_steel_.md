- Shipwreck off Kanfarandé: 14 dead, one missing and 15 injured. - Guinea-Conakry: at least 15 dead in the sinking of a boat - Kamsar: the sinking of a canoe leaves 3 dead and 15 survivors. These are the tragedies facing which the authorities and residents of Kamsar have long remained unarmed.  Coming from a predominantly modest community, Yéro Kanté, will address the thorny question of finding a viable and lasting solution to the safety of the populations during the various crossings. Thus, with the sole strength of these arms coupled with the enthusiasm of the love of good, he will succeed in bringing together all the elements necessary mostly composed with the recycled metals for the design of a boat. To this day Yéro Kanté, like a true genius who started from nothing, has a naval fleet to his credit. his solution is a local option for the revalorisation of metals in the era side of Kamsar and by the same mean, a long term factor of saving peoples lives.
