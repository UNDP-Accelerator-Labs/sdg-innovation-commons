## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) Engaging citizens in all the phases of air quality monitoring increases their knowledge about the air pollution problem in Phnom Penh. All volunteers report wanting to change their daily behavior to reduce their personal exposure to particulate pollution. 2) The mobile sensor data is as accurate as the fixed sensor's, yet the Ministry of Environment isn't ready to adopt these innovative sensors since they may fear of losing control over the data. This as a result may negative impact the image of the government.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Can't publish it due it the sensitivity of the results.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The government isn't open to adopt this innovation despite the successful testing due to reason explained above.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Mobile sensors can provide data in real-time and at various locations. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The experimentation of mobile sensors with the engagement of youth would increase their public participation and knowledge so that they can get involved in air quality problem solving.   
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Open-Seneca provided mobile sensors, training and technical support.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Institute of Technology of Cambodia who provided the student volunteers, technical support and joined the capacity building.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Environment provided their station for comparing fixed sensors with mobile sensors to test the latter accuracy. They also provided their technical input and their staff to join the capacity building. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Students who are citizen science themselves so that they would be able to apply their knowledge and understand the problem in real-time.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None
## End

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
