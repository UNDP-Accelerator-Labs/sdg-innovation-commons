This pilot plan for the artisanal dorado fishery will allow the traceability of this fishery in Ecuador. Through a computer
system, reports will be generated in real time of the catches made by artisanal vessels and the impact on protected species, key information, not only for the target species, but also for secondary and incidental ones.





By having this information, consumers will be able to know the entire process of the fishing product that he acquires, which will generate links with the producer and confidence in the purchase of a sustainable product, which will strengthen sales and the economic reactivation of these fishing sectors. On the other hand, the data collected will help to correctly monitor the sustainability of resources and the protection of the oceans.





This initiative has the technical support of the project 'Coastal Fisheries Initiative' of the Ministry of Production, Foreign Trade, Investments and Fisheries with technical support from the UNDP-Ecuador, and its partners Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) , Conservation International Ecuador (CI) and WWF Ecuador, and financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
