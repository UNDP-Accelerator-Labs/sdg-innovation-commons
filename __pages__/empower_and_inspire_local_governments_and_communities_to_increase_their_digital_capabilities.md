## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

In the DR, people tend to go to the doctor when something is serious; preventive health is very rare  People in vulnerable groups/communities tend to spend more on health care expenses due to lack of preventive care or because they have to seek care that is far away from their areas of residence  Covid pandemic has increased general public’s focus on preventive health but not so much among remote/poor communities  Telemedicine technologies are widely available and affordable and yet the government’s health ministry does not tap into that potential  The pandemic normalized teleconsultations

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

It was difficult to remake and adapt the business model because the solution had been already developed for profit and to make it   Use funds quickly due to UNDP’s time constraints.   Working with private sector partners on a public good raised issues of intellectual property

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

They were available. Health statistics are still in the process of being revamped, thus some key info was not available.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The community where implementation took place was very remote and it needed not only those technological/logistical resources were installed, but also needed to break through the community’s resistance to change and to have the approval of state health authorities to carry out the plans.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Community of Manabao, Jarabacoa, a rural community where the experiment was implemented. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

PUCMM, Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra is one of the founders of the telehealth platform eHospital, a primary care teleconsultation of physical and mental health, along with a virtual assistant called Pamela. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Intellysis D. Corp, is the founder and developer of eHospital platform.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Primary Care Center of Manabao, center where eHospital was implemented to carry on the experiment.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNDP Digital Office, through the program Digital X, eHospital was selected as one of the best global solutions to be accelerated and implemented in a rural community. The Digital X support phase of the project focused on creating front-end and back-end features such as data privacy, data analytics for government users, as well as addressing the open-questions through research and prototyping. This served as a basis to conduct further user research with sellers, buyers, and government to validate the need for these features and the best way to design them.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Having made an innovation challenge agreement supported us in the implementation of this initiative of the private sector and academia, we learned to manage projects from outside with capabilities from within and thanks to Digital X we developed and delivered in 5 months the initiative to a community that needed it.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
