## Overall goal

Collaboratively map and monitor the urban biodiversity of the city of Santa Fe to develop policies and tools for the care and prevention of its deterioration. 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens participate by providing data and information to the mapping of plant and animal species present in the green spaces of the city of Santa Fe through the ArgentiNat platform. This platform helps participants upload photographic and sound records of flora and fauna species observed in a specific location and cooperate by identifying species uploaded by other observers. As part of the project, observation tours for groups and seasonal safaris are organized in Reserva Natural Urbana del Oeste (a nature reserve) as well as outings in municipal parks and squares. In addition, upon institutions’ requests, tours are carried out in green spaces near the requesting institution.
