> Title of the innovation

Online consultation

> Brief description of the innovation

The aim of my platform is to help people understand how online stores operate and how good are delivered to their home or the post office and whose the manufacturer of the goods are they first class goods or second class ,apart from that we also help the international community at large by directing them to the right website and people who can help them with their business and how they can manage them  ,we also help the local community by inspiring people and providing them with information to start a business that can help them.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Most of the work we do is partnered with other online companies that are already established, we just direct the people to the company,and we don't make any profit from this  our main job is to help the community at large and reduce poverty  by giving the right tools to the international community and local communities

> Technical Feasibility

The business is designed by me and Google  here is the website if you would like to take a view of it 
https://time-wide-international.business.site

> Anticipated Social Impact

This is going to reduce the way we think of the online services offered by many online platforms because it's not easy to put money into something and get what you requested ,Africa  as the potential to grow only if we have the right people who will take their time and look into the matter and make information available to the community when need.
