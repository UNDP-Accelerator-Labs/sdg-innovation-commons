## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Needs and priorities of the implementing partner should be at the forefront of any design and implementation work in driving innovation and digital transformation. It is this premise that allowed AccLab to achieve all its deliverables under the Phase II of its partnership with SBS.

2. The revival of the CRVS Steering Committee and prioritization of its capacity building surfaced key insights on how cross sector government agency development work should be conducted. For instance, the Ministry of Education provided insights on how the lack of a modernized legislative framework on where, when and how birth certificates are to be used and stored provided additional signals for BDM to consider when reviewing its legal framworks. Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development provided insights on how the challenges of the current community engagement system including areas of opportunity that UNDP can provide further support.

3. AccLab to recognize and acknowlege when the partnership matures i.e. Phase II has shown a best practice in engaging and working with a government partner. The BDM unit through its partnership with AccLab has significantly grown in its capabilities to utilize the AccLab learning cycle approach to build its internal capacities and forward planning.  



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Phase II scaled through the Governance and Poverty Reduction Unit with AccLab as the key driver to implement the activities. This has afforded AccLab the opportunity to not only earn DPC but also the position to pitch to its government partner on potential for co-financing/cost sharing opportunity between SBS and UNDP.

## Data and Methods

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Phase II was primarily focused on building a CRVS prototype based on the remote access testings of the current births registration system which informed the design and creation of the new CRVS POC and MVP.
