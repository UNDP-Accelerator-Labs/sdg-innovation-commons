To rebuild trust and position UNDP as MNRE’s preferred partner for circular economy initiatives, a multi-method approach will be used. Sensemaking will help both teams interpret past experiences and realign their perspectives, while horizon scanning will identify future waste management trends to ensure strategic foresight. Foresight methodologies will enable long-term planning, ensuring circular economy integration aligns with national waste priorities. Systems thinking will map interdependencies, helping MNRE see how circularity fits within broader waste management strategies. Finally, design sprints will facilitate rapid testing of solutions, demonstrating UNDP’s value through actionable results. Together, these approaches will drive a more collaborative, future-ready partnership between MNRE and UNDP.
