"Civic Budget" is a basic tool for improving the transparency and accountability of the municipality. It will explain the income and expenses of the municipality during the year, the process of adopting the Budget and the project activities that should be implemented during the year.

The purpose of the preparation of the Citizen's Budget is to ensure greater awareness of the citizens about the municipality's budget in an easier and more accessible way.
