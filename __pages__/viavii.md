"By enabling “the era of people-to-people travels”, we aim to fulfill people’s desire to experience the world authentically. Whether you choose an experience only a drive away, or decide to travel across the globe, our diverse community of hosts offer experiences to suit every individual as unique as you are. We do that by providing travellers, wherever they may be, with a user-friendly online platform, that designs a tailored personalised travel experience based on budget and interest, while connecting them with delightful and talented people from around the world. Some have labelled this new era as “the experience economy”, we are interpreting it as; people want to live their lives more fully, not by buying more things, but by collecting new experiences. In simple words, we’re putting the traveling experience in the hands of the traveller."
