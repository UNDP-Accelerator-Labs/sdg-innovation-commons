The energy-less refrigerator can be homemade, maintaining a temperature of 6 degrees in dry areas and 12 degrees in wet areas. Designed in a easily reproduced way, from two earthenware pots, the smaller being placed inside the larger one. The space between the two is filled with sand, which is watered twice a day so that, by the evaporation of the water, there can be a cooling of the food stored inside the device.
