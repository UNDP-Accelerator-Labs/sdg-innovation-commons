BLISS, guesthouse operating in Alifu Alifu Dhigurah is investing in building local talent in tourism. The guesthouse pays special attention to hiring Maldivians, especially young women from the island for various positions within the guesthouse and invests in building their knowledge and skills in hospitality by making learning and development an important goal for every employee and giving them opportunities to learn new skills and build their confidence. As part of this endeavor, the guesthouse conducts regular in-house trainings and gives opportunities for staff to step up to assuming more responsibility. Currently the guesthouse has 18 employees of which 60% are local islanders and 33% are women from the island.
