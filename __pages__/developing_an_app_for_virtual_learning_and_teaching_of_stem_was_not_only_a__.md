## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Developing an app for virtual learning and teaching of STEM was not only a COVID response but also in line with the country's development blueprint. 




2. The Ministry of Education was keen to adopt the virtual science app for wide use in the education system not only for teaching and learning sciences but expanding to cover other courses/subjects as well as use in different levels of education (primary, secondary and tertiary). 




3. Identifying and working with the off taker of a solution the frontier challenge is addressing from the onset assures growing/scaling of the solution after the experiment. 




4. Finding champions in government departments/ministries to drive the understanding of challenge being worked on and advocate for adoption of the solution(s) identified ensures government support. 




5. Locally developed solutions have a higher chance of being accepted and incorporated in existing systems when local people/experts are involved in the experimentation, testing, iteration or development of the solution.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Government has been very responsive as the frontier challenge was in line with the country's development agenda. Although government provided support, we needed to raise funds within and outside UNDP which proved to be challenging since internally the budget allocated to AccLab is limited.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Observation: students and teachers as end users had to validate the app and proved its usability and relevance before further iterations were done.  


Direct interviews: There was need for in-depth understanding on individual interaction of the app, user friendliness of the app, knowledge of digital devices and individual outlook on the importance of the app on STEM education. 


Stakeholder engagement: assessment of interest in the app from different government departments and ministries was pivotal in gauging the scalability of the app.  


Written policies: assessment of the relevance of the app with the 10year Malawi Implementation Plan and Ministry of Education policies on education digitalization and open and distance learning helped to contextualize the technology and garner for the necessary government support and uptake of the technology. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Gamification: Use of a mobile gaming platform to utilise effective human-computer interaction mechanisms for experiments. 


Participatory Design: To involve end users of the product (students and teachers) in informing the design of the technology and participate at all points of the iterative process to ensure app was appropriate, suitable and relevant for student and teacher needs. 


Prototyping: Allowed to accommodate the iterative process to produce a refined and quality product 


Data visualization: Dashboard with graphical reports for teachers and students will visualise data generated from using the mobile app. 


Pilots: It was important to test the technology in real life settings at each stage of the iteration process to ensure the technology was validated as well as collect evidence for sharing with stakeholders.
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mzuzu University: they developed the virtual science app, we worked with them to pilot the app, we facilitated their collaboration with Ministry of Education and ensure they had access to students and teachers to validate the app.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with banks and a private charity organization. We wanted to mobilize additional resources for the development of the app to include additional modules as well as funds to support growing of the technology.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DTSI) in the Ministry of Education, they were our key partners in refining the technology and ensuring other departments in the ministry of education supported uptake of the technology. 


The Open and Distance Learning unit in the Ministry of Education to ensure there was policy support for the uptake of the app. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The Department of Open and Distance Learning, although they are part of the Ministry, UNDP has not worked with them as a standalone department. They were special because they drive the digitalisation agenda in the Ministry of Education hence their buy in meant success for our solution. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The rigorous process in developing and refining the technology demanded that we employed innovative methods and used new data sources. This systematic process provided the validation our partners needed that the technology was useable, useful and adoptable. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
