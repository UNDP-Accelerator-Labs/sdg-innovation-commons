## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1# If IoT based irrigation is used on farm, efficiency of water usage will improve 

H2 # If IoT based irrigation is used on farm, crop productivity will increase  

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Experimented with progressive farmer-led IoT design for smart irrigation consisting of : Water Moisture Sensors; Weather Station – Temperature, Humidity, Wind Direction, Pressure and Rain gauge; Automation tasks for motor/pump operation; Flow meters to measure water use; LoRaWan Protocol with Gateway; IFTT for control and push notifications.  
 AccLab collaborated with the progressive farmer to set up IoT experiment by dividing his 7 acre farm into treatment and control plots [case-control trials] to see the extent of benefit through IoT based smart irrigation system. Crop chosen for the experiment was moong (green gram/lentils). The farmer collected data from IoT based system on the treatment plots and compared the results with  control plots.        

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters Analyzed (1) Change in water use efficiency (2) Change in crop productivity (3) Change in soil nutrients (4) Return on Investment

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Automated through Sensors

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 1

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity has a low risk

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Results

Different for different agri seasons. Water use efficiency showed  0-20% improvement; Increase in crop productivity 5-10% improvement; No significant change in soil nutrients; Return in Investment could not be determined (since experimenter was changing model each time)

Since it is agriculture experiments, the scientific advice is to repeat this experiment for atleast 7 crop cycles (3 years) to have conclusive results. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

$5000

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

This experiment was led by a progressive farmer, AccLab was mostly supporting the farmer with experiment design (case-controls) and measuring devices. However, the farmer made too many changes on key parameters (out of excitement!) during the course of the experiment. So it was very difficult to comment on Return on Investment in this experiment.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

     Program teams got interested in scaling the IoT based smart irrigation to other regions and included the experiment in multiple resource mobilization proposals for conducting pilots in 500 acres of land. Accelerator Lab is facilitating this Scale-Out

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

NABARD - largest bank providing agriculture loans in India was interested in this experiment to promote smart agriculture.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes several iterations are  required across different agroclimatic zones, crop cycles and types of crops to arrive at more concrete results and recommendations.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

It is good to draw inspiration from user-led innovations. But very difficult to scale them since its difficult to resolve through quick experiments - what is implementation model? What are the SoPs? what production capacity is required? who will fund production? what is the business model?

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, IoT based systems have applications in several domains  and this experiment is an inspiration in potential value addition of this IoT technology. 
However the solution tried in this experiment with lead user innovation is not easy to replicate since there are too many factors to be determined before we arrive at implementation model.  

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore cycles happened very quickly. As the team participated in industry meets to see what is out there. 

> What surprised you?

One private sector company drew inspiration from this lead user innovation and willing to replicate/venture into IoT based smart irrigation.
