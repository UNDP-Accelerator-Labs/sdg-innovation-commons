FOCUSING ON AGRICULTURE TO REDUCE POVERTY AND ZEROING POVERTY IN ZAMBIA BY 2030

> Brief description of the innovation

Agriculture is the HAB of the economy that is not considered that much because many people think that urban life is dependent on the farmers in the rural areas. One farm is equivalent to two shopping malls but if you were to give a person the choice to choose between a farm and 2 shopping malls definately someone will fall for a mall or 2 because they do not see the value of living at the farm so with this innovation that is focused on Agriculture will help youths and women out there. Supporting Agriculture Innovation program will help reduce poverty levels amongest ourselves and the country at large. Lets always remember that No famer No Food and if there is no food then there is no future. For ZAMBIA to shine we need to focus on Agriculture.

No farmer no food and no future, you can not have a bright future while starving and while people are living with poverty. So this innovation in Agriculture will help reduce the poverty levels among the youths and ordinary  citizens. When alot of people venture in Agriculture which means there will be more products in the country and less import with more export and this will help stabilize the economy and there will be more money in the pockets of the farmers.

This innovation will help improve the lives of others because it will give opportunity to everyone regardless of there status and level of education.
