The idea is to use the enormous potential of insects for the good of the global population and to contribute to the protein challenge 2040, to meet protein needs in a way that is accessible, healthy, and environmentally friendly. The biodegradable waste is used as a raw material for feeding the larvae of flies. The production itself does not require a large amount of energy, the by-product is organic fertilizer and the process does not produce a waste. The innovator can be reached at: vedogprilep@gmail.com
