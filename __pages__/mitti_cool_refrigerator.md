> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Innovator Mr. Mansukhbhai Prajapati hails from Morbi district of Gujarat. His family left Morbi after the breakdown of Machchu Dam in 1979 and shifted to Vankaner. After completing his SSC, he worked for three years in a roof tiles manufacturing unit in Vankaner. After that, he joined his fathers business of manufacturing pottery in 1998. Mr. Mansukhbhai Prajapati has developed a small size natural refrigerator from clay material to store the perishable foods like vegetables, fruits, milk, etc and also for cooling water. It does not require any external source of energy for giving a cooling effect. He introduces the natural refrigerator as a "Mitti Cool" as totally made up from clay. It has two large water tanks at the top and bottom that cool the sides in the same manner as clay pots, keep water cool in summer. The upper portion of the refrigerator can store about 20 L water, while the bottom cabinet has separate space for storing fruits, vegetables and milk. The natural cooling process inside the refrigerator can keep vegetables and fruits fresh for around 6-7 days, while milk can be preserved for 3 days. A small plastic door having a magnetic lock is also provided to cover it from the front side. The overall dimension of the unit is 16.5 (length) X 13.5 (width) X 26.5 (height) inch and the total weight is 50 kg. The whole unit is painted in red colour for a better look. The internal storage capacity is around 50 L. Christened mud is prepared by mixing different types of materials like clay, grok, talcum powder, silicate and soda ash; and poured into the mould made of Plaster of Paris and exposed to sunlight. When it becomes dry mould is removed and the body is kept in a furnace at 700 °C for baking. The baked body is painted with red colour. For manufacturing one unit 7 days are required. Through the bottom layer of the upper chamber, small droplets of water continuously percolate below the bottom of first shelves which keep inner climate moist/wet permanently. Water evaporates through side walls also provides a cooling effect and reduces the inside temperature and thereby provides a cooling effect inside the unit. Apart from saving electricity bill, the new device also preserves the original taste of fruits and vegetables. It gives higher cooling in a dry climate compared to a humid climate. It takes about 12 h to get a cooling effect when using the first time. About 20 L of water, 5 kg of vegetables/fruits and 5 L of milk can be kept inside the refrigerator. It can lower the temperature by about 8 °C in comparison to the room temperature. It has been validated at KVK, Chas wad, Bharuch and found effectively working. The temperature in Mitti Cool is 4-5 °C lower than room temperature. The shelf life of coriander was found increased up to 4 days against 1.5-2 days at room temperature. The shelf life of brinjal, chilly &amp; okra is 3-4 days in room temperature, which was found to be increased up to 6-7, 4-5 and 5-6 days respectively.
