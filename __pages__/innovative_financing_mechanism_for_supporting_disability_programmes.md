## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that our CO is small and relies on dwindling donor funds for implementing and running projects and initiatives. Our country is classified as a middle income, hence we do not receive much funding. The Acclab would like to experiment on other innovative sources of funding that allow Eswatini private entities and civic society to contribute towards a national development challenge. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



we signed up to participate in the crowdfunding academy of UNDP this year and our proposal was accepted. The development challenge that we wish to work on in this, is the challenge of faced by children living with disabilities. 

In Eswatini, children with disabilities face several challenges, and addressing their needs is crucial for promoting inclusivity and ensuring their well-being. Here are some key aspects related to disability challenges in Eswatini, with a focus on children:

Access to Healthcare:

Resource Availability: Access to healthcare for persons with disabilities remains a challenge due to the unavailability of resources. This includes a shortage of rehabilitation healthcare practitioners and assistive devices.

Reasonable Accommodation: Persons with visual and communication impairments often lack reasonable accommodation in healthcare settings.

Stigma and Discrimination: Negative attitudes and stigma can hinder access to healthcare services.

Transportation Costs: The distance to healthcare facilities can result in high transportation costs for families of children with disabilities1.

Inclusive Education:

Limited Access: Children living in rural or remote communities, as well as those in urban slums, have the least access to education.

Disability Prevalence: Approximately one-third of these children have disabilities.

Violence and Exploitation: Children with disabilities are at risk of violence, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Understanding and supporting children with ASD is essential. Social Support and Inclusion:

Promoting social inclusion and providing support networks are critical for children with disabilities.

Initiatives that involve schools, communities, and families can enhance their well-being and participation in society.

According to the National Population and Housing Census of 2017, the Kingdom of Eswatini has an estimated 146 554 persons with disabilities, representing 13% of the population.

In 2023, it was reported that there are 1.3 billion people worldwide who experience significant disability, still face a range of barriers to inclusion.

Deputy Prime Minister's Office has recognized the need to established the National Disability Technical Working Group committee in Aug 2023 UNPRPD MPTF supports disability-inclusion in Eswatini | UNESCO. There is one known disability outreach programmed for the disabled in the country called Labaligugu -treasured ones in the country, an outreach programme to families with children living with disabilities. however there are few funding for programmes for the disabled particularly the children (or disability grants in Eswatini to support this segment of the population. for example;

Regarding crowdfunding for disabilities in Eswatini, there are initiatives like the “Disability Project” by Imbita Swaziland Women’s Finance Trust, which aims to provide access to services for Children with Disabilities (CwDs) in health, education, and social services. Additionally, organizations like Autism Eswatini have launched fundraising campaigns to provide therapeutic services to children and individuals with Autism and intellectual disabilities. However these initiatives are not sustainably run to act as a sustainable resource for the disabled community programmes.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



UNDP Acclab will conduct an exploratory exercise on disability programmes and also work with the crowdfunding center to support in the testing innovative resource mobilisation mechanisms. The value that the lab will contribute would be: testing crowdfunding as an innovative financing tool to support disability programmes and share learning that can serve as capacity building resource for the actors in the sector as well as channel those resources to the beneficiaries. 

The Acclab is well positioned to work in this area because at corporate level UNDP  and the International Disability Alliance (IDA) are working together with global partners to advance work on policies and legislative frameworks for the disabled, recognizing that it is a prerequisite to achieving the SDGs. UNDP Eswatini has also set ups a Gender and disability inclusion committee where the Acclab is part of supporting the CO come up with informed data and address this gap in both our programming and internally.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We would like to understand if innovative finance tools work in the context of Eswatini to solve development challenges. This experiment will help us learn also on how to go about using alternative financing mechanisms.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



I will use the crowdfunding method to test if innovative financing works as an alternative funding source towards disability programmes in Eswatini.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



How much funding do we currently have in the country for disability programmes? How many of the existing NGOs and organisations have vibrant programmes that provide tangible support for the beneficiaries? What are the policy gaps for disability in the education, health and job sectors? 
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The office of the DPMO as they have a unit can be champions of this work. The UN, NGOs and the people living with disabilities may benefit immensely on this work.
