Alleviating a problem of inefficient irrigation


Problem:
- Inadequate watering leads to crop loss due to water stress
- Irrigation efficiency is low and wastes resources
- Leaching potential of nitrates and pesticides impact water quality 


Solution:
- A mobile application that automates irrigation scheduling 
- - - Based on known and tested checkbook method
- - - Effortless calculation using geolocation data
- - - Using past irrigation, precipitation, and evaporation to calculate Soil Water Deficit
