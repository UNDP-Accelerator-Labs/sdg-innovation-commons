> What action learning plan is this activity related to?


The "Mineral Flow" experiment is related to an action learning plan focused on digital transformation and e-governance in the mining sector. It aims to improve the efficiency of administrative processes by creating a web and mobile app for the digitalization of Form 101, which monitors the transport of minerals in Chuquisaca. This plan is aligned with efforts to reduce bureaucracy, promote transparency, and enhance real-time control of strategic natural resources​

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity aims to understand how digitizing mining transport controls via Form 101 can improve the efficiency, transparency, and real-time management of mineral resources in Chuquisaca. It seeks to evaluate how a web and mobile app can streamline government processes and ensure better accountability.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial because it enhances e-governance by reducing bureaucracy, ensuring responsible resource management, and providing real-time data for better decision-making in the mining sector​

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF the Form 101 is digitized through a web and mobile application for monitoring mineral transport, THEN it will significantly improve administrative efficiency, reduce bureaucracy, and enhance transparency in resource management by providing real-time data and better accountability.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Development of the Digital System:

Design and implement a web and mobile app for the digitization of Form 101, making it compatible across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, etc.).
Collaboration:

Work with the Government of Chuquisaca and its Mining and Hydrocarbons Department to implement the system.
Timeline and Location:

Roll out the system across Chuquisaca’s mining sector over a specified testing phase to evaluate its efficiency.
Training and Technology Transfer:

Provide training to government officials and staff on the use of the new system for monitoring mineral transport

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

Since the digitization of Form 101 was successfully launched by the governor of Chuquisaca and is now available as a department service, it demonstrates that the original hypothesis was proven. The system's launch supports the idea that digitization improved efficiency, reduced bureaucracy, and enhanced real-time data management for mineral transport control, providing transparency and accountability. The results align with the project's goals and are accessible on the department's website as a public service

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

Most Important Learning Outcomes:
Efficiency Gains: The digitalization of Form 101 improved the speed and efficiency of processing mineral transport data, reducing bureaucracy.
Enhanced Transparency: Real-time data management provided better control and accountability in resource management.
User Accessibility: The system, available online, made it easier for stakeholders to access services.
Recommended Changes:
Continuous Improvement: Regular updates to the system to improve usability and performance.
Wider Integration: Expand the system to other administrative processes for further optimization
