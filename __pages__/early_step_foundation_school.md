> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation generate income for me in a difficult and slow manner.
It considers children who are willing and interested to acquire extra knowledge. 
In a month it can bring home a K180 to K220 from parents of well to do who are willingly to see their children progress in an extra knowledge running parallel from what they acquire in public institutions.
The innovative started as voluntarily to help the community for extra knowledge which advocated for free. Due to many challenged such as lack of learning and teaching materials, infrastructure such as desks, accommodations, water electricity and its mandate of free innovative and lack of well wishers in running such an innovative, the intention of the innovative has gone very down.
However, the innovation came up with ideas that children can be contributing at least a K5 per month thus generating a K180 from 36 to 60 candidates. Unfortunately, our target population lacks economic activities for such an innovative to help their children proceed better in education.
The target are the children around with less priverages and all those willing to proceed smartly with their education.
The challenge price do not help in a better way as it was decided for purchasing learning and teaching materials, accommodation, and enticing workers.
The innovative is a good idea for it adds value in the community in realizing their educational potentiality and help minimizing the burden of shortage of schools and teachers. It also adds value on community employments.
