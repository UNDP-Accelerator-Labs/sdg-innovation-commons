## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1- During the covid19, an online platform that enables patients to consult and schedule their appointments with doctors is central for containing the spread of the virus. 2- This healthcare platform enables a better organization and storage of patients' data. 3- The healthcare sector in Mauritania needs more digital-oriented solutions to render it more efficient and citizen-centered public and private service. 4- This healthcare solution can be combined with other existing solutions to set up a comprehensive approach to promoting healthcare service in Mauritania. 5- We learned that this is an important step toward better healthcare services in Mauritania.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Data in the healthcare sector are scarce and scattered across the country - Our sensemaking activity brought together key actors and entrepreneurs in the innovation ecosystem to discuss and disclose their ideas - This permitted us to obtain and combine data from different sources to guide an informed implementation of the solution. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods are essentiels to explore the existing solutions to the challenge and to gauge the extent of interventions that can be considered. In fact, the collective intelligence activity for instance enabled a comprehesnive mapping of different solutions as well as the possibilty to merge - several complemnantry - solution to better solution, whech led the decision to create this platform with well defined tasks and offered services.
