Biogenes APTSENS is a portable diagnostic technology that can be easily used by anyone with a smartphone. APTSENS provides informative disease diagnostic testing to hospitals, clinics, workplaces and even in the comfort of your home. Building on the scientific principles of a glucose test, APTSENS offers convenience to patients and their families, where they are able to perform tests in the comfort of their own homes. The APTSENS mobile app enables people to keep track of their health history, thereby enabling more informed treatment decisions. At the heart of this technology is a revolutionary ingredient called an aptamer. An aptamer is a DNA-based construct that mimics the functionality of animal-derived antibodies. Each aptamer is uniquely designed to selectively bind only to one specific biomarker, and this enables the detection of a specific disease or health condition related to the particular biomarker. To date, Biogenes has designed over 200 aptamers to capture biomarkers such as glucose, COVID-19, bacterial sepsis, dengue, cancers, hormones, toxins and pathogens. Biogenes’ technology enables us to design aptamers quickly, run tests and integrate aptamers with APTSENS.
