## 

In an era of technology like the one we are living in, in which everything is connected thanks to the IoT wirelessly, it has become easier to monitor environmental conditions remotely; in this case, it seeks to create an alarm system that warns of a significant change in the level of LP Gas (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), which is used daily in homes and businesses. 

The project focuses on creating an IoT alarm system to detect dangerous levels of LP Gas remotely, to alert people in the danger zone and to send notifications in case no one is present. This will increase safety in the use of LP Gas in homes and businesses, addressing a common concern in its daily use. Participants will learn how to set up a Telegram bot to receive alerts and manage queries in a database for effective tracking of hazard alerts.
