Ilumexico offers access to clean and reliable energy, catalyzing the growth of Mexican families without access to electricity, which promotes positive changes in different areas of family life, particularly in educational, health, economic, safety, production, food refrigeration, and family leisure activities. Their process includes assessing the required innovation with the communities, offering access to inclusive financing, teaching how it works and can be installed/repaired, and ensuring access to parts and equipment.
