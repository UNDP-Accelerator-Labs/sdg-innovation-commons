At $2 per avocado, 1000 avocados per tree for 100 trees per acres, and then 3 acres. This translates into $200,000 per acre and $600,000 for 3 acres. If operation costs is $100,000 per year, then profit is $200,000, making this project very viable.
Target market is Europe through the Lusaka Avocado Multipurpose Cooperative Society (LAMC) where am a paid up member. Other offtakers locally are supermarkets such Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Chippies, Freshmarks and Food Lovers in addition to Soweto Market.
