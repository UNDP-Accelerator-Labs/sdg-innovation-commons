Wastes that are inputs to briquette production (fruit peelings and cores,  green leaves, other green left-over materials, etc) are sorted, then the waste is dried up, carbonization the dried material, grinding and mixing the powder with binding material, molding and dried the final briquette.
The briquette replaces charcoal and useful minimizing deforestation and free from smoke  due to carbonization  during the process. The price is low and preferred by the residents as well as durable solution for energy needs.
