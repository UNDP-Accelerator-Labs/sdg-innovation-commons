Infrastructural

> Description of the solution

Designed by noted architecture firm WOHA founded by Wong Mun Summ and Richard Hassell. The hotel is biophilic and ecological. The building sits on a 50-50 meter site, hemmed in by surrounding towers with congested and limited outdoor views. The facility is for offices, hotels and club rooms. The architect stacked the three L-shaped blocks and flipped each of them to opposite corners for different views that overlook a sky terrace. The threee lower verandas are each sheltered by the one above, open at the sides for transparency, cross ventilation and daylight.
