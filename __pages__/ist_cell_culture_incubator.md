like the eye incubator, to make it easier for our many doctors in remote areas, the IST of Mamou has taken the time to research and finally design this discovery which will allow all cells to be kept at the desired temperature. targeted to promote their production and from this point guarantee a rapid response in this area. Our design is able to operate on solar energy as well as electric.
