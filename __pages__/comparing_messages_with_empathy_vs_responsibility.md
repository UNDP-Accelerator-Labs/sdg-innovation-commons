## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to

learn if we can use social media to test alternative messages. We have competing

arguments regarding what messages are more appealing and supported by audiences

if messages that appeal to empathy or messages that appeal to personal

responsibility. Messages that appeal to empathy make us aware of the needs of

others, whereas messages that appeal to personal responsibility point out that

one has a personal obligation or should be sanctioned.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If people see a message that appeals to empathy rather than personal responsibility, then they will engage more and be more receptive of that message



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment
- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We created two messages related to waste classification, one that appeals to empathy and another that appeals to personal responsibility. Then, with the help of the communications team at UNDP, we developed two illustrations that matched each message and scheduled it's publication in the social media pages of UNDP Guatemala.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Individual messages



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We collected data from the social media platform reports (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram)



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Less than one week



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

The costs included the time needed to design and run the experiment. We had help from the communication office designing the visual aids and wording of the messages. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Disproven. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the message that appealed to persona responsibility for waste classification had more interactions than the one that appealed to empathy. 



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The result made

us raise different questions about our methodology. It is possible that the

time of the publications influenced the results, however, the pattern obtained

was consistent throughout the three social media platforms used (Twitter,

Facebook, and Instagram). Also, it might be the case that the message appealing

to empathy was unclear (or maybe it appealed to it by a rational means rather

than an emotional one). Furthermore, it is possible that our assumption about

empathy is wrong and those messages that question directly on responsibility

stand out more. For future experiments like this one, it is important to pay

attention to the time of the publications, the clarity of the messages, and

alternative ways to observe potential or acting. Seeing the number of

interactions may not be the most accurate way to see this. We also had great

limitations to access data beyond reactions, the analysis could be donde further

using a developer account.



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than a month



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00 additional costs



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. We know have the workflow in place to test alternative messages through the country office social media platforms. 



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We want to scale the analytical techniques to use social media data, and the methodology to test alternative messages. 



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment influenced public policy at a national or local level
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We now have indications that people give more visibility to messages that appeal to personal responsibility that those that appeal to empathy. Although this is difficult to assess from the methodology used, it is possible that other measures of engagement with show different results, and we cannot differentiate the effect of the image from the wording. We also know that we can compare how receptive audiences are to alternative messages in social media. 



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

We did not have

a way to randomize the assignment of messages. Although there is no reason to

believe that people who were exposed to one of the messages where

systematically different than the other. We also didn't have much access to

data this stage, to see if users saw both messages, and saw one before the

other. Moreover, it's difficult to create similar messages that only vary in

the strategy to connect with people, there are other components to the message

(such as the image used) that could account for the differences in reactions.

We also don't have a well-developed theory about why people react to a social

media message, which is not necessarily an endorsement or receptivity.



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Certainly, campaigns endorsed by the Country Office in social media will benefit from testing their messages. 



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Ministry of

Environment and Natural Resources and Local governments are interested in learning how to promote

better waste management practices, but also other civil society organizations

and government agencies could benefit from using social media to test messages.



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We needed iterations to refine the images and the wording of messages to see if their messages were clearly contrasting and understandable. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

The methodology

can be improved. It's worth trying as a very low-cost experiment and a way to

engage other teams in the country office. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely, appealing to empathy or to personal responsibility are alternatives to try to promote any SDG beyond climate action and sustainable cities through waste management. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense has defined the topic we are working on: waste management. Explore has raised interest in the use of social media data as an unusual type of data that has potential.



> What surprised you?

We did not

prove the hypothesis, which is good to challenge confirmation biases when

making decisions on how to communicate. Usually, we want to appeal to the human

instinct of caring for others, and the natural response to be helpful when it

doesn't take much effort. However, it seems that social media audiences are

less triggered by empathy, and rather have a stronger sense of acting based on

what's right or should be reprimanded. Of course, much more is needed to

understand. But it's surprising that empathy is not clearly preferred.
