> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

"Remote indigenous communities in the Amazon, only accessible by long winding canoe trips or propeller-plane flights onto dirt runways, are the strongholds of Kofan, Siona, Secoya and Waorani traditional way of life; hunting and fishing for their daily protein, cultivating yucca and plantain, weaving baskets out of palm fibers.

Yet, many of these remote communities now find themselves on the frontlines of the expanding extractive frontier, as seismic testing for oil wells and pipeline projects move deeper and deeper into the jungle. To access to nonexistent electricity services, solar system developed by "Love for Life", have been implemented in 16 remote communities.

The photovoltaic (PV) cells of the solar panels absorb sunlight and convert the energy from the sun into direct current (DC) electricity to charge the batteries. This DC electricity is fed to the batteries via a solar charge controller which ensures the batteries are charged most efficiently and not damaged. The charge controller constantly controls and manages the energy flow in the solar electric system. It regulates the state of charge of the batteries and the intensity of the charge. It protects the batteries from overcharge and deep discharge. DC appliances like 12 V LED-lights, cellphone or radio are powered directly from the charge controller which during daylight takes the energy directly from the PV panels and at night from the stored energy in the batteries. The inverter converts lower voltage DC electricity (12V) generated by the solar panels and stored in the batteries into higher voltage alternating current (AC) to power appliances that run with 120 V like electrical power tools, computer, television, etc. The big solar system has an additional device called battery protect that protects the battery from deep discharge, ensuring the longevity of the batteries. It works as a switch that turns off all the loads. The battery protect also communicates with the battery monitor and performs the function according to the information of the battery monitor. The battery monitor works together with a measurement device called Shunt that collects and transmits all the data about the system and sends it to the battery monitor."
