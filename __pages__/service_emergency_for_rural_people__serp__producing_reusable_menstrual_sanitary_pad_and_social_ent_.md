## What is the challenge?

The menstrual health of indigenous, dalit women and girls is a major challenge in areas like Thakurgao. They suffer from various diseases and health hazards from repeated usage of unclean old clothes, negatively affecting their mental and physical health. Many of these women can’t afford available sanitary pads in the market. Others lack knowledge about menstrual health and hygiene, social taboo.
## What is the Solution?

To address this challenge, Service Emergency for Rural People (SERP), an NGO locating in Thakurgaon district in North-west part of Bangladesh, started an initiative to train indigenous dalit women and girls in Thakurgaon in producing eco-friendly reusable menstrual sanitary pads, once they become skilled, it then helps them to start social businesses through market development and value chain approach. Its pads are affordable, costing about tk. 20, re-usable, long lasting, and sustainable, requiring only 4 pieces for each period and each can be used for 6 months through cleaning and drying in the sun. Most importantly, it works with a community that needs better menstrual hygiene management solutions.
## Stage of innovation

Early commercial stage. It currently has a small team of 10 people working on the initiative
