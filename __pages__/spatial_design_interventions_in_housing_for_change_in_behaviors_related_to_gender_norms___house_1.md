## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Understanding the effects of surrounding spaces and environment on us as human, and if/how/to what extend they affect our behaviours, specifically in regards to the gender norms and roles.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If spatial changes were made in houses with negative gender exclusive spaces, then these interventions will positively change the behavior family members towards more equitable gender norms/roles

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Positive points to exploit and develop (Opportunities): The positive gendered spaces. Both the mother and the father contribute to the chores:  An intervention to the space can motivate the father to handle more household responsibilities together with his wife.  This will be done by:   - Combining the kitchen with the living room   - Adding a Kitchenette to grandma space. - Switching the guest room with Grandma's living room (suggested).   - Providing a rooftop space. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

individuals, groups, and social interaction

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Shadowing of participants, in-depth interviews

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months implementation - 6 months waiting period - 1 month post assessment

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
