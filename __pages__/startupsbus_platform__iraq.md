The Main Challenge:

The entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq is new and is still taking its first steps toward development. With many actors working to create an environment in which the private sector and entrepreneurship can foster, international attention has been drawn to reinforce ongoing efforts seeking to create this enabling environment to support the growth of the private sector and the economic development in Iraq. Several advancements have been made and the foundations of the ecosystem have been set, however, the need still arises for a place in which these efforts exist in one place and that’s where Startups bus comes into play. The StartupsBus Platform is tackling the below three main challenges within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, mainly in the newly liberated areas in Iraq:   1- There is lack of coordination& marketing of eco-system enablers' activities & programs. 2- There is lack of data about the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq, and Mosul specifically. Also, there is no use of data generated from entrepreneurs to design new activities & programs based on their needs that are not visible to the stakeholders. 3- It's  not easy for the entrepreneurs and SMEs to find local service providers that satisfy their business needs and finding channels to market their services.

The Solution, StartupsBus Platform:
