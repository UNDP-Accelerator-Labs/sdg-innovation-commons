## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

* Incentivized product based rewards for up-cycling is the most promising * Accessibility to recycling/up-cycling stations is extremely important * Explanation of the full chain effect of recycling has positive impact * Children are the ideal candidates in a post conflict setting for reviving recycling/up-cycling knowledge * Parks are an interesting reflection of deep held beliefs about the value of recycling/up-cycling

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. Unfortunately several UNDP procurement processes made us come to a standstill which made the challenge take almost 300 days instead of initially planned 100 days.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

They helped us draw a full picture of the recycling/up-cycling supply chain

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The challenge became quite complex and needed multiple phases and strategies to address each component of the supply chain and then merge them into a cohesive strategy.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Local Recycling Businesses

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

University of Aleppo - Environment Engineering Unit

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Local Municipality in Aleppo
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Having everything play out in a single project allowed us to see the project from multiple perspectives.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
