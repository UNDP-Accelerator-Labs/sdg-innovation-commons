Stingless bee honey is a superfood as it contains phenolics and antioxidants that are beneficial to our health, by nature, stingless bee honey goes through rapid hydration and a high moisturising rate. This makes it difficult storage-wise, because alcohol fermentation quickly occurs when the moisturising rate of honey is high. Thus come DEHYDOME, a portable and tool, perfect for stingless bee honey producers and entrepreneurs. DEHYDOME can be used to dehydrate stingless bee honey at its most optimum level, and from there, extract the highest quality stingless bee honey. Not only is it smaller and cheaper than conventional methods in the market, its dehydration capabilities are also remarkably efficient. The dehydrator can reduce honey's water content to below 20% in six to 10 hours, faster than the 24 hours it would take with common methods. Another interesting fact about the DEHYDOME is that it has Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities that allow it to be operated from a mobile app. This makes the dehydrator easier to control and monitor remotely as long as there is internet connectivity. Its IoT control features include a live/dead tool, operation period set, electric-use data, and even an electric bill.
