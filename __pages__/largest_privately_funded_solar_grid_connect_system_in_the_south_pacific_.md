Given the scale of the Coca-Cola Amatil Fiji production and packing facility, energy costs are a significant percentage of operating expenses. The opportunity to reduce these costs, combined with the benefit of utilizing renewable, clean energy, positively contributing to the environment, are key factors in the decision to connect with Sunergise.
The 1.1 MW PV installation is the largest privately-funded solar grid connect system in the South Pacific.
The Coca-Cola Amatil implementation is further evidence that organizations no longer have to choose the environment and sacrifice profits.Environmentally-driven solutions, such as this one, provide a direct benefit to the organization's bottom line.
