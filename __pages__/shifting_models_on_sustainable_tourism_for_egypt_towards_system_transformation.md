## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- We identified three main shift needed to approach system transformation in our problem space, toward shifting the tourism sector into a more sustainable one: 1- Moving from an over-exposed business model to a locally driven market that is more resilient.  2- shift from a clone tourism model (one fit for all) to a diversified value based offer 3- treat the sector with a multi-nodal distributed governance approach instead of centralized one. Sustainable tourism really means sustainable Egypt translated. - Deep demonstrations need government engagement from the inception phase to align with national priority as a nationally owned sector - working on a tourism portfolio proved the need to create an internal governance system that purposefully serve the shift from project to portfolio and a framework to manage cross programme collaborations and synergies

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1- trusting the process of deep demonstration by internal team as well as external stakeholders. It takes much self-discipline not to jump into solutions and spend more time in the problem space. 2- Lack of data on global models for sustainable tourism that would support a business case. At the end of the day this is a sector in Egypt that the economy targets relies on to a good extent. 3- aligning with the strategy of the ministry of tourism specially with the shift in leadership and ministerial shuffle 4- long coordination time to pilot with local programme some of the portfolio options

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

tourism sector is highly influenced with narrative and knowledge of practitioners. We needed to probe those using qualitative research. We also looked for market intelligence for defining current gap and to back up a business case shifting to a sustainable model. We were aiming to use social media analysis but we phased technical difficulties.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used system thinking to understand how "sustainable" would apply to the tourism model, beyond green cities. and how we can use that to define an intent. We used sensemaking to identify patterns, and opportunities within the country office and projects that could serve the portfolio intent. We used co-creation to build a participatory portfolio with relevant stakeholders internally and externally.
