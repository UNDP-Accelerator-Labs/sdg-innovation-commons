Providing quality in-service ECDE training to care givers and educators while rendering support to parents and communities in income projects to support their ECDE initiatives, in an integrated way. The aim is to enhance access to quality ECDE to marginalized and vulnerable children especially in rural areas to foster self-reliance in society.

> Brief description of the innovation

Leleni Early Learning Initiatives is an organization aiming at enhancing access to quality Early Childhood services to the most vulnerable children especially in rural communities of Zambia as a channel to self-reliance in society.  Education which is a critical component of any effort towards self-determination begins before birth and growing research demonstrates that children who have experienced ECD interventions do better in school which forms a strong basis for personal prosperity. By providing quality ECDE for young children and their families in rural communities, Leleni aims to set the pre-conditions for educational equity, efficiency and success while supporting young parents to lead in providing for their children’s quality development. While providing culturally based training to educators and care givers for ECDE centers, at the same time, parents and communities will be supported in pursuing income generating activities to sustain the ECDE initiatives. With this action, Leleni aims to embrace diversity inclusive of all, culturally, of ability and disabilities; to foster quality but low-cost ECDE programs; innovation-nurturing creativity, community ownership and self-sustainability. With this action Leleni will create a positive impact on economic development, cultural inequities and disabilities to break the effects of poverty in communities of Kalumbila District, North-Western Zambia.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Current disparaging conditions for most vulnerable rural communities’  are characterized by vistas of low and unequal access to education, poverty and limited options for solving socio-economic problems. An initiative that approaches these circumstances from the foundations in an integrated way,  will provide a platform for engaging in the processes of formal and informal life-long learning for the whole community.
With this initiative, children will have more opportunities to reach their optimum development and learning potential, through ECDE, making better transitions in formal education and other subsequent stages of their lives. They will be ready to learn and aspire to excel with a strengthened sense of self, social and cultural identity as a stepping -stone to their community and national identity. Parental and community participation will build resource and knowledge thresholds and attitudes generating energies to raise opportunities for addressing all aspects of child development; inclusive of all orientations and backgrounds for equity and unity; for vibrant and self-reliant communities, taking charge of their children’s affairs. There will be an increased awareness and recognition of children by young parents; as very valuable assets to invest in for the survival of communities and the human race and development.
