> Title of the innovation

Future clean energy

> Brief description of the innovation

A smart waste recycling bin to transform organic waste into clean energy called biogas energy in addiction producing liquid fertilizer. proper disposal of kitchen waste will be done in an eco-friendly and cost effective way. While calculating the cost effectiveness of waste disposal we have to think more than monitory prospects only. The dumping of food in places and making the places unhygienic can be takengo to care of; it adds to the value of such Biogas home smart bin. Natural components like micro-organisms, kitchen waste &amp; biodegradable waste viz paper, pulp can be utilized. The bio-gas produced from food waste, decomposable organic material and kitchen waste, consisting of methane and a little amount of carbon di oxide is an alternative fuel for cooking gas (LPG). Also, the waste materials can be disposed off efficiently without any odor or flies and the digested slurry from the bio-gas unit can be used as an organic manure in the garden by that we are promoting a clean zambia.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The bin will produce a product called Methane which is a very powerful greenhouse gas: its global warming potential it 23 times higher than that of C02. In this way, recovering of biogas is very interesting to limit the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, biogas is a renewable energy form because biomass naturally releases biogas by decomposition. By using biogas as an energy source, we can reduce our dependency on fossil resources as coal, oil and natural gas
We will produce biogester which are home sized by that we are getting money from sales and also maintainers fee which you can add to your product ,Our market its big has zambia is grow and people are turning to affordable energy to use ,while the prize money will transform this project has it will scale up mass production and sitting up a plant.

> Technical Feasibility

The internet of things (IoT) well be  used as a base to develop this bin to offer a recycling system that convenient to the household furthermore the bin its a portable bio gester which is degsi
