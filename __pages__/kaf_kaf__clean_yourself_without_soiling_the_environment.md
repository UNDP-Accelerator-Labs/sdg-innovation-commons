About the Solution:

This solution is working on replacing the plastic bottles of the shower products (shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel) by bottles made from environment-friendly soap. Hence, this is a two in one product where you can use the bottle as a soap and the core (content) as a shower product. This is a zero waste product because all the product will be used.
