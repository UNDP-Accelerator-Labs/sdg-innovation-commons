> Title of the innovation

SR Health

> Brief description of the innovation

I aim to develop an app and website that show a map that users can use to see where they can access SRHR services. Users will be able to see services offered at any health facility through a map. They will also be able to search for a particular service and all facilities offering the service will be availed to them. For example, if they are seeking HIV testing services, they can click/search for HIV testing and all facilities offering HIV testing services will be shown to them. They will also be able to get directions, see operating hours of facilities as well as get contact details for the facility.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income generation will be done through allowing business to advertise their products/services on the app and/or website. This will allow businesses to reach a wider market. The target market is all people seeking SRHR services particularly youth and women. The prize money will help with creating the website and the app as well as help make processes such as data collection more simple. Information on where to access SRHR services will be available online thereby reducing the use of paper that would otherwise be used to print this information.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is a map that shows health facilities offering SRHR services and the services they offer. It will also show opening and closing hours, contact details, e.t.c. An officer from all health facilities will be given permission to update their services in order to give users up-to-date information. There will also be a search bar where users can type and search for a particular service and they will be shown all health facilities offering the service. They will also be able to get accurate directions to the facility. Users will also be able to give a review of a particular health facility/service in order to give other users more information. In order to ensure there is privacy, users will be able to make an anonymous review. We intend to get information (including contact details) about all health facilities from the relevant authorities in order to begin developing the app.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will allow people easier and increased access to SRHR services. It will also save people a lot of time. Instead of going to a health facility and finding that the service they are seeking is not available, this innovation will allow users to see where the service they seek is being offered thereby saving them time and money. It will allow the physically challenged such as the blind to access information about SRHR and services through innovations such as text-to-speech.
