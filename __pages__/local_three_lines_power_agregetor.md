In most of the area sides in conakry, the management of electricity is not well done, many sectors receive les power than those located closer to the central point. facing the need of good power level for domestical electrical usage, poeple are paying for more than one line so that they could use the one with the best level. Our friend N'Danè as illustrated here on the pics, has created an agregetor able to associate three inputs power levels and collect from the output the required level according to the usage needs.
