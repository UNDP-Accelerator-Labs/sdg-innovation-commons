## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Test cases for foresight approaches for future fit governance 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If foresight is used in the design / strategic planning / community engagement process, then the result is an anticipatory governance models.



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention
- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Co-creation and design thinking was critical for joint ownership. Foresight and futures tools were applied to governance - Three horizons framework, visioning tools like Inclusive Imaginaries, participatory futures was used for workshops

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Better risk mapping, change of policy from as-is

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

consultations 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
