Description: Similar to traditional filters such as the eco filter, but in this case the filtration is done by a "candle" that is horizontal. It is supplied without the water containers, which must be purchased locally. It can be purchased as a siphon kit, with a tube connected to the filter that channels the water to a drinking water container.

Very easy to use. Maintenance is performed by cleaning the candle periodically, this being the safety mechanism.   

Interesting feature: It is easy to transport and its maintenance is simple.
