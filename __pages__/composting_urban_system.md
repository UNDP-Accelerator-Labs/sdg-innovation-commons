Hagamos Composta is a project that aims to reduce the amount of garbage produced in cities through an organic waste collection service. Through good management of organic waste, these are transformed into compost to reincorporate them into the soil, provide nutrients and reduce pollution. Gerardo Montes de Oca's project has collected more than one million kilograms of organic waste in fourteen cities in Mexico.



The project is now in over 20 cities in Mexico, 2 cities in Honduras and in Madrid, Spain. It serves more than 8,000 families.
