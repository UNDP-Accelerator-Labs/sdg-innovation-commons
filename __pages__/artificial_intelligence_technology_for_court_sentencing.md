AI Sentencing System is a machine learning-based system developed by Sarawak Information Systems Sdn. Bhd. (SAINS), in collaboration with the High Courts of Sabah and Sarawak, to generate sentence recommendations in court cases. This is an initiative to reduce sentencing discrepancies in court cases for similar offences. 
The system works by giving out sentence recommendations, but it does not mean that it is the AI system that passes the sentence. Instead, it provides the magistrate with a benchmark based on past sentencing trends across all the courts. The power to make a final sentence decision remains within the discretion of the magistrate. By making the sentencing process more consistent across courts in different locations, AI sentencing can support a more equitable justice system the public can believe in. AiCOS (AI Court Sentencing) is currently deployed for possession of scheduled drugs, an offence under section 12(2) punishable. 
The use of AI Sentencing System is increasing as magistrates become more familiar with the process and observe the outcomes. Over time, as a majority of magistrates adhere to the recommended baseline, this innovation will help to synchronise common grounds among the magistrates thus promoting consistency in sentencing. In the long run, it is expected to increase effectiveness and transparency in the delivery of justice.
