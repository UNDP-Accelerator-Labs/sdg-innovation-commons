Overall goal: Articulate an extension practice that strengthens open collaboration in the study of everyday phenomena and research, among researchers and citizens, especially youth. Measure environmental noise in different areas of the province of Tucumán that help determine the degree of noise pollution of the environment in which people develop their activities. Identify the level of noise in school and health environments to raise awareness of how much it can impact the health of people and animals, among other others. Specific: Promote a scientific and collaborative analysis of the environment of activities such as teaching and health to identify noise pollution and then expand the scope of study. Develop the ability to make the results obtained through research available to the community. Encourage the interpretation of the data collected and generate the appropriate space for discussion and exchange of ideas among different actors. Train for the presentation of reports to public agencies in charge of environmental decision-making and impact on society, such as municipal and provincial governments. Promote collaboration with other organizations, networks, and associations to monitor and care for the Tucumán environment. Make an approach to the cultural identity of the region from a sound perspective, that is, to identify those sounds that are typical of the region (from birdsong to business noises), in order to integrate sound to the urbanistic view of an area.

Description of citizen participation This is a proposal and part of it is in process, so some steps may change depending on previous studies. Measurements First, students from primary and secondary schools discuss, analyze, and conduct a noise pollution measurement protocol organized by researchers from the National University of Tucumán. The measurements will be conducted with cell phone applications suitable for this purpose that allow measuring sound levels and geolocation. Once the measurement is generated, the data is uploaded to a map that displays the data on a web page. The information is completed with a survey of the population of the study area (problematic areas from the point of view of noise in the microcenter of Tucumán, which will allow a first approach to the design) invited to participate through a web page. With the data obtained, students from secondary schools in the province participate in a first analysis.  The proposal begins with the participation of students from high schools in the province of Tucumán and then will be offered to the community in general. After the entire process, a report will be prepared and presented to university and municipal authorities. If the participating citizens assess that the problem is serious (based on available legislation, for example), the process of proposing solutions at the municipal level begins.
