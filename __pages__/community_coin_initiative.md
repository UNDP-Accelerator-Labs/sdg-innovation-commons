Community Coin Initiative

> Brief description of the innovation

Community Coin Initiative (CCI) is an organization that is non government, that saves money for the community in form of fundraising. This is will be achieved by the process of installation of piggy banks at various locations in the community, the city country or the world at large. The piggy banks in form of secured labelled boxes or anything that can insert a coin or any other bank note will be placed in shopping malls, bars, churches markets etc, where anyone that feels to donate inform of any amount of money including something as simple as a coin from there change after there payments. This money will be helpful in the community in terms of emergencies at night such as transport fair to hospitals during serious illness, pregnancy or any other emergency that may require an individual to pay and they are not capable.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The money collected from various institutions and works of life, will be saved for use in terms of any emergency arising from the community especially individuals who might not afford funds they requested to pay even something like a taxi to the hospital to deliver a baby.

The chief executive officer that will make sure everything is running accordingly, the finance manager working on the accounts and keeping records of the input and output of the funds, the communication committee that will be in charge of receiving and Making calls for easy allocation of the problem and if goes well the transport committee to drive people to the hospitals and any other emergency needed.
The plan is to get permit from the city council and other government authorities and institutions to allow the insertion of these fundraising piggy banks in various sectors of life.
And money to purchase the piggy banks and print them with the name for identification.
