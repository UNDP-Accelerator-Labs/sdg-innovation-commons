Plastic Pollution Challenge: People lack knowledge about waste sorting, means of reaching waste collectors, and incentive to sort waste. This leads to waste being dumped into the sea, making waste management difficult for authorities. Currently, there are 0.8 tons of uncollected plastic waste in the ocean.

Solution: mGreen is a mobile app that educates people about waste segregation, rewards them for taking part in recycling activities, and connects residents with collectors and merchants at shops and stores.

Innovation: We built 3 mobile applications for 3 groups of users – waste collectors, households, and store owners. This system encourages residents to sort garbage at home, helping collectors collect waste conveniently. Furthermore, the mGreen loyalty coalition platform also provides a system for merchant promotions, where points can be exchanged by mGreen users for customer care programs.
