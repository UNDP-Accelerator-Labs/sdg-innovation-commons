> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The level of demand for goat meat is increasingly becoming overwhelming in the Copperbelt region and beyond. The fact that there is always a ready market for commercial goat farming makes the business attractive.                                                                                                                                       In this regard, the project intends to position itself in such a manner that it attracts consumers not just locally but beyond the region to include areas like Kasumbalesa which would link us to the Congo DR market as well which is quite vast. We will market our produce to the following:
Households, Individuals, Restaurants, Bar operators, Super markets, Senegalese community in Kitwe and Cross boarder traders at Kasumbalesa. 
We will endeavour to deliver to our clients as and whenever they demand as this has been a challenge they face from existing suppliers. We will expand our production and invest in the transportation of our produce to the market as majority of the suppliers who bring goats to Kitwe for sale transport them on bicycles which means only a few consumers would be a catered for at that particular time as a bicycle can only carry a maximum of three goats. We intend to venture into value addition in the near future which would make us fetch more from our produce and hence keep our competitors at bay. With increased production, we would afford the luxury of keeping our prices lower in order to stimulate demand for our goats/goat products.

> Technical Feasibility

The project expected results are as follows: (i) Improved enabling environment for private sector investment; (ii) Production, processing and market infrastructure established for key value chains; and (iii) Capacities for youths in the livestock sector value chains enhanced. 
The direct beneficiaries will include the (i) Current 10 members who will spearhead the project; (ii) at least 80 family members of the group members; (iii) residents and local companies; (iv) Marketers and the Hospitality industry. 
The project will indirectly benefit residents through other value chain supply linkages such as entrepreneurs, marketers, input suppliers, buyers, processors and transporters in the value chain activities at the project site.
Nkana Youths Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Limited in an initiative of ten unemployed youths based in Nkana Constituency of Kitwe District. The youths did a thorough feasibility studies before finally deciding to venture into goat production by first forming and registering a co-operative on 21st January 2021. This decision was arrived at as a way of leveraging on the vast opportunities the livestock farming industry offers both within the Copperbelt and beyond, contribute to the country’s food basket and produce in excess for export. In this regard, the project will kick-start with an initial of 40 Does/Nannies and 10 Bucks. With this number, the production level would be at minimum 80 bucklings and doelings assuming all necessities are in place.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will contribute to meeting the requirements for nutritional value per    
household not only Kitwe but surrounding areas as well. The products will be sold at affordable prices to accord even those that could not afford before an opportunity to buy our produce. The project will also assist us the youths who cannot access formal employment as the government cannot employ everyone to create our own employment and employ our fellow youths.
