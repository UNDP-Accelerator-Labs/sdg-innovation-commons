> Title of the innovation

Livestock Farming (Goat Keeping)

> Brief description of the innovation

As indicated above, our business is mainly aimed at keeping Goats of great value for commercial purpose. The area is conducive for the business as it has plenty of water and enough vegetation with good climate for the proposed business.
This is Chimbamilonga of Nsama District, Northern Province.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Initially we are a group of 7 members of which 4 are women. We understand and believe that under livestock Farming, good income and pricing is dictated by the breed you are offering.
And YES it is a good paying business.
Therefore, our first target is acquiring good breeds of goats. 
Northern province is in short supply of domesticated animal meat, in particular goat meat, meaning, we have a ready market within, surrounding areas and also our neighboring country Congo DRC.
We hope and believe that with our strategic plan, the community will greatly benefit. One of our objectives is to teach members of the group the correct and beneficial methods of keeping Goats. This is cardinal as it will equip members with relevant skills to stand alone. Inturn, group members will help willing community members and also cross breed the animals.
We have seen it happen in some areas, we have faith that even here it can workout provided we are helped with the correct incentives.

> Technical Feasibility

The business is currently not at commercial level as few who try to keep feed their animals while tied to a tree. 
Firstly, goats need to be free and protected from other predators. A wire around is first on our Implementation plan with a shelter inside to protect the animals from rain.
Secondly, livestock always need medication at all time therefore we will come up with a working plan (with consultations) for Dozing, Deworming and other preventions.
Third is the acquisition of a good and big breed. Specifically for business.
It's important to mention that land is already available for the Implementation of the project.
Once animals start multiplying, willing community members will be given one he-goat for cross breeding and they will also be expected to later share with others and the chain goes on.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In the recent past, the main economic activity in this area was fishing. Due to climate change, the lakes are drying and fish is equally finishing/reducing hence survival has become a challenge.
With this project, it can be a great turnaround, an appropriate intervention to the community since goats easily multiply and are disease resistant and also the climate is favorable.
Livestock Farming can be one of the best methods to arrest the negative impact of climate change since in areas where they used to keep animals have been impacted so badly. It is a positive move to equip communities in areas where there is still good vegetation, rainfall and climate with skills on animal keeping so that as a nation, we create a reserve for animal food supply and Northern Province is one of the options.
