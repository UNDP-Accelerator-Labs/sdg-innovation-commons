A handmade wooden coffee cup holder which has become very popular amongst local drive-by coffee shops in Amman, Jordan. This is commonly used to deliver coffee from the small coffee shops to neighboring customers within walking distance, not those who are passing by in their vehicles. It is difficult to track who is the original designer of this product.
