> Title of the innovation

Clean water act accessable to all residents 24/7 without interruption due to climate changes.

> Brief description of the innovation

My plan is to bring water closer to kabanana residents in lusaka,by means of setting up water tanks which will be accessible to all residents 24/7 everyday. I am a resident here and I have seen the struggle of having clean water in every household due to lack of running water by 3/4 of residents here. Water is mostly accessible from the lucky ones who have water tanks in their yards and it's accessible by buying of cause.

Well since water is not free here,my inovation plan will definitely generate income for and the people I intend on working with.this plan will help 3/4 of residents to access clean water on a daily basis 24/7, which means residents won't have to spend most of their trying to access water(it will save time) as well as satisfy the need for water.my target market are the residents here.the price money will help in setting up this inovation plan and realize a dream which will cover not only me but the residents at large.

> Technical Feasibility
