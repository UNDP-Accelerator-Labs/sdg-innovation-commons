Description: The way these systems work is through the installation of PVC collecting gutters on the edges of sheet roofs. These gutters conduct rainwater into a water tank, where the water is stored. Once the water is stored, the beneficiary families can open a tap, which allows the passage of water through a filter that purifies the liquid, for later consumption.

Interesting features: It is a replicable method in different communities, since the organization has created a manual so that anyone can do it in their homes. In addition to capturing rainwater, it can filter it directly. The materials can be purchased at any hardware store and are relatively affordable.
