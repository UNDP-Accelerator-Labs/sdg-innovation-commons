The idea was initiated in 2013 when the manager of Huye Mountain Coffee visited Guatemala and Costa Rica from where he learnt that coffee based tourism is possible. This is an initiative by an individual company that aims at promotion of coffee production and coffee based tourism. The initiative has improved the standard of living of the people who live nearby as they got jobs in the Coffee factory and tourist guides. It has also boosted tourism in Huye District. It is an inspiring business model towards entrepreneurship which is needed for poverty graduation.
