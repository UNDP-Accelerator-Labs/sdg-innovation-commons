> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Firstly, we will be able to generate income from the subscriptions per semester. Then We will also have other direct sales of materials such as exam preparedness, identity kits, and notes. On top of that our website is running google AdSense, which is going to be earning us over $7,000 per month from google depending on the keywords that will be used. We also have additional youtube income on the impassive income plan, by simply producing youtube videos and sharing videos. This will be earning us an additional of $10,000 per month. Our aim is to make tertiary education affordable, by getting leading of lecturers and other unnecessary admin costs. 

Our target market is directly the school leavers, any person who has completed grade 12, and has difficulties attaining tertiary education due to lack of funds or due to high poverty levels. The indirect offtakers are any working professionals who would want to either study further or simply have dropped out and would want to continue with tertiary education.

The challenge prize will help our business to grow and earn leverage in the Zambian market. This is possible through marketing, admin logistical costs, and also establishment of digital inclusion centres in selected provinces. The Prize money will help us employ the right staff in selected position for better growth.

The value addition of innovation on the environment is that it is the first mover, designed in both Web app, and mobile application, with an interface that offer modernity. Our platform creates a free way of learning without any payment at all. the only thing students or any participant would pay for is subscription.  Assessment, in terms of exams and any other form of continuous tasks are handled by the University of Zambia (MOU being signed). This platform will offer a chance to any person, anywhere, anytime and anyhow to access tertiary education regardless of the status quo.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in form of an online SaaS, optimized with online courses that run in conjoined efforts with the Massive Open Online Courses offered by top leading universities and organizations around the world. Our students will learn freely, from the audited courses provided by foreign universities, and our local team will provide continuous assessment through our chief examiner office. 

The platform is able to offer the best courses ever that will prepare an individual for the future job market, though our curricular emphasize personal growth rather than job seeking. 

The prototype exist and you can access it on https://www.alteriatires.org 

Our proposed implementation plan is as follows (with funds available):

1. September 2021  - Massive recruitment
2. September 2021 -  Establish partnerships with colleges and schools who will 
 host our digital inclusion centres.
3. October 2021 - Create awareness among the general population of Zambia.
4. November 2021 - Create Digital Inclusion Centres in various colleges and primary and secondary schools
5. December 2021 - finalize with recruitment 
6. January 2022 - Launch of the Alternative tertiaries program to the rest of the country.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Making sustainable efforts is a huge way a business can have a positive social impact.

By making efforts like reducing the tuition fees students  have pay in tertiary education, choosing more enterprise-biased courses that would offer diverse options on the job market, switching out traditional learning modes to complete online modes, empowering the poor young people and uneducated adults through free learning and choosing responsible, a business can significantly reduce the poverty among families, revitalize hope in their community — and contribute to the SDGs for both local and world improvement.

Tertiary education is one of the most important sector in society. with Zambia having an approximately 4% of enrolled students into tertiary education, mostly because the majority cannot afford the fees associated. Our platform becomes the most relevant both in design and service.
