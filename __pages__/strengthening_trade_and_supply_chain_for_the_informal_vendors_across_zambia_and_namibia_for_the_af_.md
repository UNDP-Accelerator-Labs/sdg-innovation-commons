## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

The participation of MSMEs in cross-border trade of countries in Angola, Zambia, Namibia, and Zimbabwe under the SADC Agreement is hindered by several factors, including non-tariff barriers, limited access to finance, and inadequate infrastructure. Informal cross-border trading activities have cushioned the impact of economic shocks and contributed to regional integration in Africa. However, informal entrepreneurship and cross-border trade face challenges, including limited access to resources and infrastructure, and regulatory barriers. Overall, MSMEs and the informal sector play a significant role in cross-border trade in Africa and must be supported to fully exploit the opportunities offered by digital technologies and the AfCFTA.

Namibia's cross-border trade faces both opportunities and challenges. The country has identified priority reform opportunities to enhance the role and performance of the state in addressing cross-cutting bottlenecks. The digital trade era also poses challenges for Namibia, which must adapt to the new environment and leverage international cooperation to address the challenges posed by digital technologies. As trade becomes increasingly digital, we have found that  MSMEs and in particular the informal sector in Namibia are in urgent need of digital skills and infrastructure to expand across borders and compete in the global market. The informal sector, which accounts for a significant portion of Namibia's economy, also faces challenges in adopting digital technologies due to limited access to resources and infrastructure. Digitalisation therefore presents opportunities for the informal sector to formalise and access new markets. Overall, Namibia's cross-border trade must navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by digitalisation to remain competitive and grow in the global market.


## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

It was important to test the data with informant interviews based on gaps that the last informal sector survey report highlighted.
