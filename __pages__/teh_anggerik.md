'Teh Anggerik' is a research product by the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM). It is created in the form of exclusive gift package that consists of four (4) types of herbal tea flavours: Misai Kucing (cat's whiskers), Roselle, Asam Gelugor (tamarind), and Karas (agarwood). 
Each type of tea has its unique nutritional and health benefit and is suitable for tea lovers who are also health-conscious. The 'Teh Anggerik' tea box that is designed with its personal 'Teh Anggerik' logo has received trademark recognition by MyIPO (TM2020029856). The logo is inspired by the Anggerik flower, or tiger orchid. The close relationship between the tiger orchid and the parent tree that shelters it symbolises the interdependence of humans with the forests for the continuity of life and well-being of living. The tiger orchid is a natural treasure that should be protected, preserved and conserved for the next generations. 
This product is produced by GMP and HACCP status manufacturing factory to ensure the quality and safety of the product.
