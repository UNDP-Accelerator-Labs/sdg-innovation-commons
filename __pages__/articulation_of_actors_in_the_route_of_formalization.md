## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The construction of an entrepreneurial route and the formalization where conditions of articulation are generated where in each entity or actor the entrepreneurs find a link that facilitates the process and makes clear the requirements and processes in each of the entities and the steps to follow.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we articulate all the actors of the entrepreneurship ecosystem and the institutions in charge of business formalization to support the entrepreneur for his formalization process, then the entrepreneurs would have a clearer path towards formalization and growth.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experimentation group will receive clear and specific information on the route they must follow to formalize, as well as a directory with the links of each person within the entity that will facilitate the process.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Entrepreneurs that are going through their formalization process 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data will come from the number of the entrepreneurs that completed their formalization process vs the ones who didn't 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 Months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
