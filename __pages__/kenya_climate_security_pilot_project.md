## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Community led initiatives such as resource management committees were mentioned as an effective mechanism in resolving resource-based conflict in certain areas. Groups of Muslim religious leaders (Imams) and youth had sprung up to try and address the issue of conflict within the county. These groups which had been formed by Imams and youth respectively as a solution to resource-based conflicts had played a part in enhancing social cohesion among the different communities by mobilizing their respective peers for dialogue.   As opposed to the older generation, young people were perceived to be optimistic in efforts that sought to enhance social cohesion. This had contributed to intermarriages for instance. There is thus an opportunity to leverage the youth dynamic in conflict mitigation especially given that young men are usually the ones who are incited to fight each other.   Considering that search for pasture and water drives pastoralists from the hinterland to the dry season grazing areas, interventions such as the Bulto Abarufa water pan had prevented pastoralists from venturing into crop production zones thus contributing to relative calm since they now had water and pasture which had regenerated around the water pan. Water and pasture resources have an influence on pastoralist household and herd mobility. Construction of water pans need to take into consideration this dynamic to ensure pastoralists do not migrate into farming zones in search of pasture and water.  An increasing number of pastoralists are engaging in opportunistic cultivation. While this is not new, falling herd sizes and increasing settlement among pastoralists is making it an activity with low opportunity cost for the least wealthy families. This presents an opportunity for policy intervention where the government could set up large scale reserves as dry season grazing areas.   Another lesson was that the resource-based conflict also affects pastoralists by pitting them against each other in Tana North sub-county. An example given was fights breaking out because of control of a water point.   Besides stress-related search for pasture and water which leads pastoralists into farms, the location of livestock markets also aggravates conflict between pastoralists and farmers. The return journey for pastoralists to the livestock market in Tana Delta is two weeks. This forces the herders to graze their livestock in the Delta as they wait to sell their livestock. Ferrying livestock to the market using the available means of transport could shorten the duration but this is considered expensive.   Additionally, herders who are normally hired to look after the livestock are paid based on the livestock condition and number of livestock. This leads them to search for pasture by whatever means to ensure they get paid. This is what leads to encroachment of planting fields especially during drought. Interventions thus need to map and engage such unusual suspects.   Whereas football tournaments have always been touted as a way to bring communities together, opposing fans could instigate conflict. In most instances, the different sets of fans are from different ethnic communities. Approaches such as having mixed teams of members of different ethnic communities have been tried with some measure of success.   Also, an important endogenous resource management adaptation in terms of household mobility was the imposition of a restricted grazing area around primary schools. The protected dry season grazing zone is for the exclusive use of settled families with children in primary school. This helps prevent school going children to adopt negative drought coping mechanisms when forced to drop out of school in search of pasture for the livestock. During the stakeholder engagement, it was clear that most of the actors were addressing climate action and security risks in a siloed manner despite the benefits that would come with integrating their efforts and the fact that no one agency alone can manage the security risks prompted by climate change. The design of future projects should take into consideration stakeholder cooperation by integrating the approaches of these actors to make effective responses possible and achieve transformation. UNDP could deploy its convening role in setting up a consortium that embodies a portfolio approach while addressing the root causes of conflict. This consortium needs to pay attention to the gifts, skills and passion of local communities.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Given the timelines of the pilot project, it was difficult to deal with the complexities of scaling for both individuals and institutions. The timeframe for instance was not realistically enough to influence all parts of the system (economic, social, technical, political) and collaborate with relevant stakeholders in ways that take advantage of these organizations’ comparative advantages.   Core to the Accelerator Lab’s theory of action is the belief that people are the experts in their own lives. Rather than build a logical framework with predefined outcomes, we embraced an emergent approach to systems change and began building relational trust with the members of the groups through co-design sessions to help us tap into the power of the participants’ lived experience while allowing the participants to envision an imagined possible future and think about what might need to happen to achieve it. This approach has the potential of releasing new possibilities from the connections that form. Nonetheless, building deep relationships with others takes time which the pilot did not afford us.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose these types of data to help convene multiple perspectives and help uncover better pathways in addressing climate related security risks. As a result, the approaches helped us pay attention to the gifts, skills and passion of local communities. We were able to build participatory scenarios with the target users in order to create an appealing vision by enabling them to reflect on the experiment design and then identifying ideal future visions after rolling out the experiment. The sessions centered on working together with the knowledge generated during the stakeholder engagement sessions and developing creative solutions for what is needed to empower those involved in promoting integrated approaches to manage and reduce climate-related security risks and strengthening the resilience of communities affected by the dual challenges of conflict and climate change. The co-design sessions not only allowed for collaboration with communities but also facilitated relationship and trust building with each group.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The pilot project benefitted from the insights of an integrated approach bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders. The multiple perspectives helped in the design of the portfolio of experiments by taking into consideration the diverse drivers of climate related security risks.  Having the co-design sessions within the communities meant a better reach and practical immersion sessions with the participants. This not only helped us better understand the climate-related security risks in Tana River County but also helped us surface some of the community-led solutions.  One of the challenges cited for low enrolment of young people in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions in Tana River County in a previous intervention was the long distance to these institutions. The pilot project afforded an opportunity to test a pop-up training centre which meant bringing trainers and training equipment to the community as opposed to trainees covering long distances to the TVET institutions. This approach saw a 100% retention rate and interest from other young people who had not been selected to participate in the motorcycle repair training. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Kenya Community Support Centre (KECOSCE) and Amani FM (A community radio station): Peace champions are now able to connect directly with the radio station to share what is happening in real time through an alert number which is toll-free. KECOSCE and Amani FM accompanied us to the co-design sessions and shared available opportunities with the youth. The co-design sessions with the community groups enabled us to create, deploy or tap into a citizen sensor network to provide real time situational assessment/feedback through WhatsApp which is essential to managing conflict and can be used to help identify potential solutions to be explored, tested and monitored.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Hola Vocational Training Centre (Hola VTC): Trainers from the centre volunteered to support the delivery of the intensive 2-week motorcycle repair skills training. This was an opportunity to pick out lessons from the pop-up classrooms through a place-based approach in a bid to reach more young people in hard-to-reach areas with vocational skills. Majority of the youth do not enroll in VTCs owing to a variety of reasons including the long distance.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

National Drought Management Authority (NDMA); Tana River County Government - They were not only key interviewees but also worked closely with us during the co-design sessions as a way to help them learn about different approaches of engaging communities and understanding their needs.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Whereas none of the partners were new and unusual to UNDP, it was the methods of engagement which were new. For instance, utilizing the radio platform as a early warning system by tapping it as a citizen sensor network, immersing Government officials in communities through a place-based approach and pop-up training centres as an avenue to reach marginalized communities with skills-based trainings as a pathway to resilience building.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
