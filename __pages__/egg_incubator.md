> Brief description of the innovation

Egg incubator
The incubator is an apparatus that is used to regulate environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and turning for successful hatching of the fertile eggs placed in an enclosure.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1. I will hatch the eggs for the the farmers at an affordable price.( K4 per egg)
2. Will sale the incubators to farmers that wants them. 
3. Will make all sizes from 10 eggs to a million eggs size incubator according to the pocket of a customer.
4. My incubator uses less power

> Technical Feasibility

The construction and performance evaluation of this automated eggs incubator for poultry farmers. The aim of this innovation was to produce a low cost user friendly modern incubator to increase the production of day old chicks for small and medium scale poultry farmers. The incubator has the hatching capacity of 704 eggs but I can make all sizes. Factors that were considered during the performance evaluation of the incubator were humidity, 55% and temperature, 37° C during the first 18 days and were maintained at 37.5 °C till hatching. Turning of eggs was achieved with the use of tilting trays mechanism controlled by a programmed electric motor. The trays were lifted through an angle of 40° either side of horizontal at every hour and lasted for four minutes. 100 fresh, healthy, well developed and matured eggs were used to test the incubator. The result of the test revealed the following average values- fertile eggs 95, infertile eggs 5, hatched eggs 85 and hatchability of 89.47% was achieved.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will help solve the problem of chicken shortage in that anyone with eggs will have his /her eggs incubated at an affordable price.
