> Title of the innovation

Quail poultry farming

> Brief description of the innovation

My quail poultry farming is a partnership done together with 3 of my other colleagues that was achieved by each contributing capital to purchase eggs and take them to incubators which then hatch. The capital also cuttered for feed to sustain the quails during their tanure of growth. My quail poultry farming is done on a small scale currently, which is achieved by buying week old quail chicks and kept in a small space such a chicken run.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income for me by selling quail meat. Preferably cooked or smoked or raw. They will be packaged one by one. The cooked ones will go for a higher price compared to the uncooked ones. These will be sold in market places and target groups such as school going students like university students or college students. I look forward to further invest in the business so that I can be able to shift on a large scale in order to grow my business.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is just designed by making a platform where you can keep the birds themselves not forgetting cluttering for feed and medicine. At the same time the environment needs to be conducive for the birds in terms of temperature.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation is able to impact the lives of others positively by employing and empowering people in particular youth of my age to help them generate some income which may help them in various ways such as taking them back to school.
