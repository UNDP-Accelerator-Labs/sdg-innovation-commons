Naki Football Academy is giving people the opportunity to be part of a community and help them to overcome past experiences.
In Nakivale Refugee Camp there is a lack of opportunity and employment, which leads especially many young men into drugs and crime.

Naki Football Academy trains youth into football teams and stays healthy and occupied while competing among each other.

Founder Songa Bahati is also passionate about Poetry and is using this skill for creating awareness and to raise funds.
