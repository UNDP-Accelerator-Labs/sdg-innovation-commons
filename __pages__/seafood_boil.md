> Brief description of the innovation

Seafood Boils, are a combination of different seafood items and vegetables. We know seafood  is one of the most underrated foods being that we live in a land-locked country. There’s little literature on ways to enjoy seafood. This innovation aims at introducing diversity in the seafood world found locally. It combines carefully sourced out ingredients for the boil and introduces a very creative, healthy and enjoyable way to indulge.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The prize would enable us to broaden our trading field by providing a physical location easily accessible to the public thus creating income not only for us as the business owners but the youth via channels of employment. This will also include youth who have not had the opportunity to get an education.
Our target market is not limited to age but rather includes the vast majority of Zambians who are adventurous enough to try creative foods. Aquaculture takes us less space as compared to agriculture and also reduces bycatch of other species. Studies have shown that fish do not contribute as much to co2 emissions on the planet.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently no seafood boils are available in Zambia. A careful selection of seafood is identified as well as paired with a source for a desirable flavor  profile. This is the proposed implementation plan: 
The work plan- to establish a physical location and infrastructure that is easily accessible to the general public.
Resources and budget- Acquire sustainable amount of resources to ensure the work plan is in motion according to the budget set.
Stakeholders- Not limited to but include unions, shareholders, supply chain partners, regulatory agencies, employees 
Risk assessment- identity the difference between “hazard” vs “risk”. Identify potential clients who have shellfish allergies therefore creating awareness in this area plus stand by emergency services.
Quality control- to ensure all products are up to standard by implementing pre-production inspection, during production inspection, piece by piece inspections.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We have never had seafood boils being served in Zambia before. Our innovation will draw the interest and curiosity of many thus increasing the pool for our target market. It starts from children and stems all the way to adults. Given the opportunity, we would be creating employment on a large scale to all Zambians from different walks of life, not limited to the educated only.
