> Title of the innovation

Youth challenges nowadays

> Brief description of the innovation

Some of the challenges as youths we are facing are as follows;
1. A lot of us youths we have finished schools and with good results but where are we? Home Why? We are unable to find sources where we can raise money from in order to achieve our set goals. Government please consider us by giving us bursaries or student loan in order for us to achieve our dreams so that we will be able to contribute positively to the community, district and nation at large. Please government put this into consideration we are a lot who have finished school but not taking it beyond secondary level please help us to achieve our goals as we are the future leaders of tommorow if you don't give this opportunity to us then who will be the leaders of tommorow?
2. Youths we have the mind of taking our country on a different level of development by only if the government brings youth empowerment and let it be open to everyone or everywhere not only considering one side NO. Let every youth have access to it by so doing we are taking the country's development higher. Youth empowerment can be done in different ways not only by giving money but by training them how to do things like farming professionally

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will help us to achieve our goals if you give us bursaries or student loans and we will bring growth to the nation and it will enable youths to contribute positively and it will make us youths to apply the knowledge we were taught at secondary level by our teachers. 
It is going to be beneficial to everyone in such a way that may be you have empowered me with something because it's not everyone who will be given due to the availability of goods or services so the remained ones will benefit from me may be I will have a project then I will employ them by so doing everyone is benefiting

> Technical Feasibility

The plan is that the government should have a well budget for us youths more especially to the education sector it should provide us with bursaries or student loans so that we achieve our goals because as we all know that Education Is The Key To Success

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will help others as I mentioned earlier on that it's not everyone who will benefit from the first hard no but for example if am trained as a farmer I will need some people to help me with some work so it will bring job creation because I will employ people
