## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Open Innovations - Open innovation processes enabled by the Open innovation platform 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to create an enabling environment for open innovation processes at the individual/community level and public, private, and civic sectors by creating an open innovation platform. The Open Innovation platform is envisaged as a digital innovation space that will bring people together and drive collaborative development efforts through open innovations. This platform will serve as a convener for networking, ideas sharing, seeking collective ideas for existing challenges related to COVID 19 and beyond. It will enable virtual collaboration, creative ideation around different challenges/opportunities, stimulate innovative actions, facilitate learning and future-thinking in society, host experimentation, and showcase global inspirational development practices. The platform will promote systemic thinking and innovative perspectives with the power to accelerate sustainable development in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other countries. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Socioeconomic challenges are complex and require radical innovation that cuts across organizational and sectoral boundaries, with an emphasis on much greater inclusion of all citizens in open innovation processes. Currently, there is no open and inclusive innovation tools/spaces in the country to enable collective intelligence actions, and broad-based partnerships. Idea-based innovations that are organized ad-hoc and have their own (web) space, in time create fragmented, scattered, and difficult to access public innovation spaces and the power of adding and expanding multiples ideas, partnerships and facilitating an innovation ecosystem in the country, and in the region or globally, is lost.

No official data. However, on one hand, we observed a vast number of idea-based innovations organized in the country by different organizations from the public, private, and civil sectors. These challenges are organized ad-hoc and have their own (web) space, which in time create fragmented, scattered, and difficult to access public innovation spaces, and the power of adding and expanding multiples ideas, partnerships and facilitating an innovation ecosystem in the country, and in the region or globally, is lost.  On the other hand, having organized 4 innovation challenges (up to 200 idea-based solutions generated from individuals, private and civic sectors) and 2 future-oriented conversations (up to 15 innovators and disruptors showcasing their work in Future Talks series of the event on air quality and next generation of urban spaces for more than 200 people, the Lab also observed the significant interest of people from all spheres of life in open innovation processes and reimagining the future of development.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Development of an Open Innovation platform as a one-of-a-kind digital innovation space in the country will bring people of all spheres of life together and drive collaborative development efforts through open innovation processes. Moreover, it will enable establishing partnerships between different stakeholders that would not otherwise have a chance to collaborate creating a more diverse network of partnerships, as well as the value on all ends.   Furthermore, the Platform is envisaged as an online connector between people, data, and technology, consisting of: Innovation challenge space to enable the organization of innovation challenges; Hack the problem space to facilitate collective ideation and problem-solving; Learning space to provide access to innovative approaches and practices, and to inspire new thinking; Future-looking space to host the “Future Talks” as a series of future-oriented conversations; Experimentation space to host sandbox experimentation initiatives; and Innovation community space to enable registered participants to engage in activities/discussions in Platform’s spaces. It will be available to all interested stakeholders to use for ideation/innovation challenges/crowdsourcing, and it will serve as an innovation depository, so knowledge/ideas remain accessible to all. Based on the previous experience in running open innovation challenges and future oriented conversations, as well as designing different topical experiments and all of that with a vast number of different partners, the Lab is uniquely positioned to work on this platform, and more importantly on the processes that it will enable, to ensure a positive start for the platform utilization in the country.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

If provided with a digital tool such as the Open Innovation Platform and support to effectively use it, would the individuals and representatives of private, civic, and public sectors embrace the open innovation processes as a norm in development and joint collaboration? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The sole purpose of not just the Open innovation platform, but the process that it will enable, is to inspire the co-creation and introduce and support the collective intelligence, design thinking, system thinking and co-designing and implementation of pilots as part of wider experimentation, further establishing these methods as norms in NexGen development. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Voices of the people are often not heard in developmental ecosystem in the country. Thus, the open innovation platform and processes will enable those voices to be heard and translated into new ideas, innovative solutions to the current developmental problems in the country, patents, that will also influence the decision making processes. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Open Innovation platform and enabled processes can connect, in a unique way, public, private, and civic sectors in the country, as well as individuals to the innovation ecosystem in the country through collaborative thinking and joint work. In this way, the platform can be a single digital space for a network of a vast number of different stakeholders and individuals and the creator of the joint innovation ecosystem.  If successful, the Open innovation platform and enabled processes can become a harmonized streamlined corporate (UNDP) tool to be used globally instead of creating event-based digital spaces that in time fragment knowledge and partnerships.
