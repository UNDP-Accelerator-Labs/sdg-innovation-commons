WORLD POOR PEOPLE SURVIVAL PLAN

> Brief description of the innovation

This is an elaborate and detailed design of an unprecedented economic based model, laid on document . The plan, which is different from any other existing economic theory in the world is designed for implementation by individual national governments of the especially poor nations of the world. It is designed in a unique manner and is primarily created to address the problem of inadequate or no necessaries for the majority poor and will touch three sectors at once, food, shelter and clothing for all citizens, which challenge no existing plan has been able to solve.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The plan's initial commercial prospects lie in the fact that it will be offered for sale to all governments of the world's nations numbering over 200, as a product of intellectual labour, this will earn a lot of money for me and for my nation as a result. Eventually more money will be generated to the nations that will adopt the scheme through sale of their products from the system

> Technical Feasibility

The plan is a document based design, it uses existing machinery and other industry equipment for operation and will be implemented by individual national governments since it requires high scale investment and national dedication. The design operates across three aspects of economic output, food, shelter and clothing. Its actual prototype is in the possession of I the maker

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will ensure that all people in a given nation will have sufficient food, shelter and clothing necessary to carry out a meaningful basic existence. With that, the level of moral and emotional well being of all citizens will go up and there will be a significant reduction in the ills of society as a result of improved life quality.There will be more happiness and more sense of self esteem which lacks in the current state of deprivation among the hundreds of millions of impoverished human beings across the entire world in many different countries
