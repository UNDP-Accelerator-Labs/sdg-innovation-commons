## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Informal markets are used by formal companies to offload good and produce tax free making the informal market no so informal  2. The change in prices in between is not as crucial as the supply price and the end user price. Knowing those is enough for most produce  3. Price changes during the supply chain are mostly opportunistic therefore hard to track. very few price changes are preplanned, but rather happen during negotiations. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, the biggest challenge was that government supplied mobile tablets stopped working. 5000 of them. This stalled the project. An investigation revealed they were substandard

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The goal was to get pricing info that people are not willing to report. Agritex officers used interviews and focus groups to get info from farmers then followed up with a tablet based method 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We worked with farmers to create a tool that would allow them to easily report pricing information to agricultural extension officers. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

na

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

University of Zimbabwe, Midlands State University 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Knowledge Transfer Africa, VIAMO, StreamSpot 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Department of Extension services 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

StreamSpot was identified during the Digital X program as a way to get pricing information to farmers in a low cost manner. They use nodes of streamers to create a LAN that allows users to access daily updated info cost free. The idea was to install them on mobile scooters used by extension officers. We worked on a concept note with them, but the idea was shelved when senior leadership changed in the year. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

WFP
