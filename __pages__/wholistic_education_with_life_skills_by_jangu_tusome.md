Wholistic Education with life skill Sponsorships programmes for vulnerable Ugandan Orphans

Jangu Tusome translated from Luganda means: “Come let us study”

Jangu Tusome is a local Ugandan community based organization born in SINA and a partner to Jangu e.V. in Germany for educational sponsorships of orphans in Uganda throughout high school.

If you are interested in sponsoring a child through Jangu Tusome, please find more details here.

Since 2014, many of the former sponsored students started to engage in the work of Jangu e.V. to support their younger brothers and sister of the Kankobe Children’s Home. Being sponsored as a child, they now sponsor others and create an outstanding, sustainable cycle to tackle the social problems of Uganda. Nowadays, Jangu e.V. doesn’t only provide sponsorships and life guidance to orphans from Kankobe but includes many other project. Thus, in 2016 former sponsored students founded “Jangu Tusome”  which stands for the coordination of the sponsorship program in Uganda. Together they take on essential roles like paying our partner schools, handing out scholastic materials and supporting the sponsored students in every day life. The fact, that the children of the Kankobe Children’s Home receive a proper education and are able to grow to mature and independent humans is in many ways owed to the work of the “Jangu Tusome” Team.
