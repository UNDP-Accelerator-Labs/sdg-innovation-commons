## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

   Green Islands
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is how to  increase the forests areas by introducing innovative techniques on agriculture in Cabo Verde.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The desertification issues in the Cape Verde Islands over the past decades has proven to be a very serious problem that affects the entire archipelago. During Covid-19 pandemic several families lost their jobs and quality of life, so many of them need to find alternatives to sustain their families. In desertification, there are concerns of soil erosion, inaccessible land and the lack of field workers which makes agriculture significantly inefficient. Cape Verde island is mainly sustained by agriculture and tourism. It is important to ensure that agricultural practices are improved and the desertification issues resolved by reforestation.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The geographical location of Cape Verde islands and the dry climate, The drought that has plagued the country for three consecutive years is directly and indirectly affecting 37% of the population, which corresponds to about 196,000 people, most of them rural areas.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This high tech work is not currently being explored in the Cape Verde islands, mainly due to lack of funds and resources. There no current competitors that provide these types of services to communities and people.   Is quite revolutionary in using different drones to improve agriculture, reforestation It not only contributes to general economy, but it can also improve people’s quality of life while mediating the impact and devastating effects of Covid-19.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In regard to agriculture, Cape Verde is significantly affected with dry climates and limited farmers. The drones can release different types of seeds at a faster, more accurate and precise manner without requiring workers to be in the fields. Planting according to our current climate, agriculture numbers will not completely fall and workers will not be exposed to Covid-19 virus. In addition, families can benefit from momentary crops such as, corn, beans and other types of cereal which we know requires minimal water and its favorable to current climate conditions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

There is a need to minimize the impact and effects of global pandemic on the agriculture(What the revolutionary way to counteract and minimize the impact)… Who is most affected by the impact of dry climate and pandemic on the agriculture?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It’s extremely useful in tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by understanding the human needs involved, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, by creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and by adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

They will collect the real situation on the agriculture and reforestation on this pandemic.
