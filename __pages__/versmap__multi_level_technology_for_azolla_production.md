VERSMAP is a multi-level planting technology to increase Azolla Pinnata production as a source of animal feed. With VERSMAP, Azolla production can be increased fourfold, amounting to 900kg of Azolla produced every month for each VERSMAP. This is sufficient to feed approximately 300 ducks, ensuring food security for the animals. The cost of poultry feed can be reduced by up to 50%.
