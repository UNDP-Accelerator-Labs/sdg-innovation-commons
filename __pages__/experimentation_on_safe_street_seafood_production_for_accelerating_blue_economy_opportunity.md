## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Our specific learning intent is to know how training on hygiene and safe street food preparation can increase the capacity of street food vendors or hawkers in Cox's Bazar to maximize their income with highest tourist's satisfactions

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF street producers and vendors can be trained in hygiene and safe seafood production, THEN more tourists will be attracted to have street food at Cox's Bazar

H2: IF proper training can be provided to the street food vendor, THEN their capacity will be increased, and they will be motivated to serve the tourist in a better way.

H3: IF more tourists can be attracted to street food at Cox's Bazar, THEN the income of local street food vendors will increase simultaneously.

H4: IF the condition of local street food providers can be developed, THEN it will increase market linkages enhanced to improve sustainable local income.

H5: IF tourists are satisfied with the street seafood quality and the service provided, THEN it will result in promoting branding for sustainable blue tourism.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Non-monetary resources from UNDP projects - 1. Time allocation from the team; 2. Beneficiary group identification and selection; 3. Provide logistic support from the project's allocated budgets like Street Food Cart (Van), Vest with cap, hand gloves, and apron for hygiene maintenance.

Non-monetary resources from Uttaran included- 1. Training module development, and capacity building of the street food vendor.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology that was chosen for the experiment worked well with the community. It improved the partnership with local govt. agencies in providing technical support and resources to the street food vendors. Creation of brand for the street food vendors and development of market materials such as online pages, brochures, flyers, and posters have helped to increase tourist satisfaction in the local street seafood. Another thing that should be inserted in the methodology is the behavioural insights module for the street food vendor. As it is not only the hygienic food but also the decent behaviour of the food sellers that attract the tourist for tasting their food.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

10 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

3,600 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, this activity has a follow up stage as it is important to know whether the selected beneficiaries are getting continuous benefits from the activities or not. Moreover, to establish strong backward and forward market linkage, it is required to bring the experiment one step ahead and a next phase of action-oriented strategy formulation.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, after successfully piloting, the initiative is planned to scale up at different parts of the country with the street food seller where tourism is highly profitable. According to the plan, the core strategy of the initiative would be the capacity development of the street food vendor while engaging one or more suitable Implementing partner organization/ private organization. Experience and dedicate staff will be engaged for Community mobilization, Group formation, Nursing, on field session/meeting, linkage development and awareness raising and capacity building activities. Leaving no one behind, Gender equity and women empowerment and environmental issue will be the core essence this scale up. Gender issues will effectively be mainstreamed across all components of the project.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

It was realized that access to finance is a significant challenge for the informal street food vendors for which they do not have the facility of obtaining loans form formal financial institutions. If we can support them in gradual formalization process then, their accessibility in formal institution would increase and will contribute to central economy.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacles and challenges we encountered during the activity as follows:

1. Beneficiary are doing mobile business or street hawking and not stable in a particular place that why it a challenge to provide them follow up support.

2. Major challenges is eviction of street vendor by Local authority.

3. They don’t have legal paper to do business.

5. They don't have even access to electricity, water to ensure proper hygiene to the consumer

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

As this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit the whole AccLab team under UNDP. More specifically, the Experimentation team as the success of this experimental activity might motivate the team to pursue more such experimentations for accelerating the SDGs in order to carry out inclusive development.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Outside the UNDP, the street food vendors from Cox's Bazar might benefit from the results of the experiment because this experiment has created a proven strategy for the street food vendor to maintain hygiene as well as the quality of the food while serving street food to the customer. Also, the tourist/customer will be benefitted as they can have hygienic and quality street food without the fear of falling sick.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, this experiment requires several iterations as this experiment is designed only for the street vendors of Cox' Bazar, but in Bangladesh there are many such attractive tourist places where the potentials of tourist-friendly services like street food vending is highly demandable. And to provide tourist with the high quality and hygienic food.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

It is unavoidable to develop a sense of hygiene among the street food seller for ensuring safety and wellness of health of the customers. So, replicating this experimental activity would require several training and behavioural insights of the street food seller. It should be reminded that a systematic approach must be applied while replicating this activity.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this experiment can be replicated in another thematic area like informality, youth unemployment which are relevant to SDGs: 8, 10,12, 14, and 17.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore phase influenced the shaping of full experimentation of the learning cycle. This is a different kind of experiment that was done to improve the quality of street food at the most visited tourist spot. Sensing the depth of challenges, we have mapped the solution and explored the way out. Then piloted the experiment with a selected number of street food seller and trained them on hygiene and quality assurance of street sea food that is consumed by the tourist at different tourist spot.

> What surprised you?

It was surprising that, before piloting the experiment most of the beneficiary (street food seller) didn't have any hygiene equipment like hand gloves, cap, food cart/van to serve food to the customer. Also, they didn't have any market linkage to expand their business at national and international level.
