> Brief description of the innovation

The Minana Food production system is an organic, sustainable, scalable, self-perpetuating and profitable food production system that combines several agricultural disciplines and principles to maximise food production and densities in very small spaces whilst only using a fraction of the water of conventional mass agriculture methods. 
To achieve this the system firstly produceses nutrient rich water by extracting beneficial microorganisms (microbes) from compost using a brewing process such that the final liquid contains all of the organisms that were present in the compost before brewing
Leafy plants like lettuce and spinach are suspended above a reservoir of nutrient rich water. This nutrient rich water is conducted to the roots as necessary. 
Root and fruiting plants like carrots and tomatoes are planted in wicking beds that use capillary action to directly water plants from the bottom via a reservoir contained at the base of the bed. 
Conventional irrigation systems are also utilised to water surrounding ground crops with nutrient rich water
This is in addition to the compost and manure as well as minimal tillage techniques being used to create ‘living soil’ that provides the most ideal and natural growing situation for the plants in the ground.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Minana Food production system will generate income by selling quality organic salads and vegetables to
• Retailers including super markets, wholesalers and grocers.
• Directly to high-end volume consumers (hotels and restaurants).
• Retail sales directly to individual consumers at Farmer's Markets. 
Our unique selling point is quality, consistency and reliability. Our salads will be attractively packaged and branded so they appeal to supermarkets and we will work closely with restaurants so we grow exactly what they want and forge good relationships. The challenge prize will provide the much-needed capital required to expand the prototype to a fully commercial system. Currently a quarter acre plot has been purchased in Chilanga, where the commercial system will be built. The prize money will also help fund a training program and online courses so as to empower the next generation of agri-preneurs with the objective of teaching profitable farming. We will also offer consultancy to existing farms that are looking to be more profitable and efficient by helping then implement our practices
The system uses only a fraction of the water of conventional mass agriculture, 
No use of harmful synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides 
It encourages the natural ecosystems with in the soil to thrive.

> Technical Feasibility

A working prototype is currently in operation, its key components include;
1.	The mineralisation tank that produces nutrient rich water by extracting beneficial microorganisms (microbes) from compost using a brewing process such that the final liquid contains all of the organisms that were present in the compost before brewing
2.	The passive sub irrigation component where Leafy plants like lettuce and spinach are suspended above a reservoir of nutrient rich water. This nutrient rich water is conducted to the roots as necessary. 
3.	A recirculating deep water culture component where fruiting plants like tomatoes and cucumbers have their roots complexly submerged in highly oxygenated nutrient solution for optimum growth
4.	An aeroponic component where the roots of the plants are suspended in a chamber of nutrient rich mist
5.	A wicking bed for component for root vegetables. Wicking beds use capillary action to directly water plants from the bottom via a reservoir contained at the base of the bed. 
6.	Conventional irrigation systems are also utilised to water surrounding ground crops with nutrient rich water
7.	This is in addition to the compost and manure as well as minimal tillage techniques being used to create ‘living soil’ that provides the most ideal and natural growing situation for the plants in the ground
The mineralisation tank and the passive sub irrigation component is the first thing to be implemented.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Minana Food Production system will
1.	Provide food and “give life” by teaching willing people an energy-efficient way of achieving “food- freedom” within an integrated eco-system.
2.	To help people become self-sufficient, economically-independent and commercially-active
3.	Develop profitable businesses supplying sustainably grown vegetables to domestic markets and implementing the practice in local communities across Zambia.

The below points demonstate Minana's relevancy

a.	Statistics indicate that in the year 2014 alone Zambia imported vegetables worth US212.6m, (ITC Trade Map) on the other hand only exported vegetables worth USD$ 11.5m to DR Congo and other COMESA member states. This shows that there is an opportunity for Minana to create wealth and income if these imports were substituted by local Minana produce. 
b.	Production and supply of local vegetables in formal markets falls far below quantities and quality standards demanded by the market through major retail chain stores such as Pick n Pay, SPAR and , Food Lovers’ Market. For example, Food Lovers’ Market procures only 10% of its vegetable requirement from local smallholder farmers with 90% imported from South Africa. This strongly suggests that there is a demand for is quality, consistency and reliability when it comes to produce.
c.	A common problem in Zambia is that smallholder farmers to do not have the capacity to supply the formal market because they are constrained. They lack capital, knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary for production and marketing for them to benefit positively from the value chains they participate in. 
d.	Export volumes in 2003 were 8,588 tons of vegetables, eighty percent of vegetables were destined for the UK. Export products included baby corn, fine beans, baby carrots, asparagus, runner beans, sugar snaps, tender stem broccoli, okra, mange tout peas, passion fruit, spring onions, chilies, patti pans. All these varieties will grow exceedingly well in Minana.
