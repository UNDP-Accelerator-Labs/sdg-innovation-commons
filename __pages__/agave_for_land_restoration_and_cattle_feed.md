</span></span><span class="jCAhz ChMk0b"><span class="ryNqvb">This strategy combines the growth of agave plants and nitrogen-fixing companion forest species (such as mesquite), with rotational grazing of cattle.</span></span> <span class="jCAhz ChMk0b"><span class="ryNqvb">The result is a high biomass, high forage production system that works well even on degraded semi-arid lands.</span></span><span class="jCAhz"><span class="ryNqvb">

</span></span><span class="jCAhz ChMk0b"><span class="ryNqvb">The system produces large quantities of agave leaves and pineapples, up to a ton of biomass during the 8 to 10 years of the plant's life.</span></span> <span class="jCAhz ChMk0b"><span class="ryNqvb">When chopped and fermented in closed containers, the agave leaf makes excellent animal fodder and is cheap (2 cents a pound).</span></span> <span class="jCAhz ChMk0b"><span class="ryNqvb">This agroforestry system reduces overgrazing pressure on fragile pastures and improves soil health and water retention while reducing and storing enormous amounts of atmospheric CO2.</span></span><span class="jCAhz"><span class="ryNqvb">
