Energy

> Description of the solution

The energy community operates a processing and standardization unit for residual biomass that comes from the regional unit of Karditsa (forest residues, agricultural residues, urban tree prunings, etc.) and turns it into pellets. The region has a significant potential for residual biomass flows originating from agricultural residues, wood processing industries, and municipalities, which can support the development of bioenergy. Members of the community are municipalities, small and medium-sized enterprises, associations (estimated 8%), and citizens.
