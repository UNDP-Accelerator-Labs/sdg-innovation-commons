CREATIVE ECONOMY - innovative path for development of the Kyrgyz Republic
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Lack of innovative and integrated approach to stimulate local development which might stimulate both economic empowerment and social cohesion.&nbsp;

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Global: The cultural and creative industries are one of the major global success stories of the last 30 years. In emerging markets, the Creative Industries, underpinned by freelancers and microenterprises, is a major driver of informal jobs for an estimated 300 million people and projected to reach a global valuation of US$985 billion by 2023 (Callanan et al., 2020). Meanwhile, UNCTAD, which has been tracking the trade in creative goods and services for close to 20 years, found that creative economy export trade growth averaged 7 per cent between 2002 and 2015, often outpacing the growth rate for other industries. In 2015, UNCTAD pegged the value of the global market for creative goods at&nbsp;a significant US$509 billion. According to other calculations by UNESCO and dating back from 2013, global creative industries reportedly generated US$2.25 trillion in revenue and formally employed 29.5 million people worldwide. According to Covid-19 forecasts, the creative economy could represent 10&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;of global GDP before 2030.&nbsp; “The creative economy is one of the world's most rapidly growing sectors, contributing 3% of the global GDP. Creativity is also a renewable, sustainable, limitless resource that we can find anywhere around the world. As we face the climate crisis and the pandemic, its potential to drive a human-centric, inclusive development has never been more relevant. Creativity is the industry&nbsp;of tomorrow” (UNESCO, International Year of Creative Economy for Sustainable Development).&nbsp;




Local: The importance of the development of the creative economy in Kyrgyzstan has been highlighted on the part of the Government in the strategic documents.&nbsp; For example, the “National Development Program&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Kyrgyz Republic&nbsp;until&nbsp;2026”, states that “the area of creative industries has particular potential for employment. Development of diverse creative industries requires establishment of investment and regulatory environment, granting specific status to the residents of creative parks, creative zones and districts, and introduction of a special tax regime.” On April 21, 2022, a presidential decree "On measures to develop the creative economy and create conditions for the progressive development of the Kyrgyz Republic" was signed, and the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a Concept for the development of the creative economy for 2022-2026.


Over the period 2014 - 2018, contribution of the creative industries to the GDP of the Kyrgyz Republic stayed at around 1% annually, whereas foreign direct investment to the sector constituted about $500K per year. In 2020 the total number of those employed in creative industries were 13,000 which is around 0.6% of the total number of employed population. There is a high employment rate of youth and women in creative industries: 60% are women, 40% are youth. Total number of enterprises registered in creative industries in 2020 was 798 units, 513 out of which were from the private sector and 285 were state enterprises.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

1. This is an innovative development path for Kyrgyzstan being recognized at the national level; however, there is no full-fledge project at UNDP or at other development agency working in the country aimed at the development of creative economy ecosystem; 2. According to Richard Florida, creative economy is developing where synergy occurs from the combination of three "T"s - Talent, Tolerance, and Technology which can lead to more inclusive and creative development of traditional and innovative industries; (https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/richard-florida/the-rise-of-the-creative-class/9781541617742/)&nbsp;
3. Cultural and creative sectors are a significant source of jobs and income, and also generate important spillovers to the wider economy;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;Cultural and creative sectors are a driver of innovation, a source of creative skills with strong backward and forward linkages in the economy, and as a magnet that helps drive growth in other sectors such as tourism;&nbsp;
5. Beyond their economic impacts, they also have significant social impacts, from supporting health and well-being, to promoting social inclusion and local social capital.&nbsp; Please learn more here:&nbsp;Creative Economy, Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration Creative Economy, Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration (miro.com)&nbsp;
