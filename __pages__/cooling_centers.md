> Description of the solution

Cooling centers can provide a cool environment to those who cant afford the electricity cost of air-conditioning. Cooling Centres are commonly used across the US. They are relatively low-cost strategy that can utilize existing infrastructure and personnel and be relatively implemented by a variety of stakeholders. Their use has a high biological plausibility for reducing heat-related illness and death. A cooling center is a location, typically an air conditioned or cooled building that has been designated as a siste to provide respite and safety during extreme heat. This may be government-owned building such as library or school, an existing community center, religious center, recreation center, or private  business such as coffee shop, shopping mall, or movie theatre. Some countries have set up cooling sistes outdoors in spray parks, community pools, and public parks. Sometimes temporary cool spaces are constructed for events as a marathon or outdoor concert. Implementation is done by different groups e,g health department, city government, non-profit groups, combination of agencies or partners.
