> Title of the innovation

Mobile Money Plus

> Brief description of the innovation

With over 10 years of work experience in the fields of health and mobile money I've come to to understand the extent to which business minds when put together can expand opportunities for many and thereby  fully actualise the potential of any business venture at this time  I want to speak specifically concerning mobile money making it more valuable, more accessible more simple . Making it not only local but international ,to maximise its full potential that is why I call it mobile money plus this will allow not only SMEs but also so the big Banks and all stakeholders bank government organisations ,NGOs and many other platforms.The market in Zambia has changed and the potential for money exchange is mobile money.Thus it is important to note that the booth setup is to be replaced with something attractive to both the deemed poor and deemed rich to replace the filthy booths in our cities with greener, futuristic and cleaner Zambia.That is a Zambia that we all want a smart and income generating Country.The new style mobile money will employ countless individuals.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The booths have turned our towns to filthy looking because they are substandard.Thus,with the new vision of a more United Zambia that is both innovative and prosperous it is now time to let go of mediocre businesses in our markets. We need to completely let go of the traditional booths in mobile money and introduce a new lawful way of doing business with more durable mini banks mobile money dubbed Mobile Money Plus. By turning the booths into mini banks people will also grow their businesses in a more professional manner and will slowly eliminate the cadre way of  doing business. It's time for mobile money to change course and move forward.

> Technical Feasibility

Mobile money in Zambia is growing at a very fast pace,and the front runners are MTN and Airtel. So a prototype already exists. I have over 3 years of work experience in the field of mobile money and fully maximised it's potential to the fullest.I have a working knowledge of how the mobile money business works.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The current market is flooded with potential as you can see in many of our streets today.During the last harsh 5 years the mobile money business has been growing at rapid pace. My innovation is to expand its potential to something more focused on expansion and innovation. It will change how people do bank business because let's face the facts people are not interested in banks many prefer the booth.My innovation eliminates the idea of a booth oriented approach to a mini bank approach that will operate like banks but more simplified so that people have access to bank services.It will be cleaner and greener and will employ many Zambians it will also eliminate hooliganism in business. The current market is in great need of mobile money services and Zambia is strategically placed to spearhead this.Its not a local approach but an international approach.
