> Brief description of the innovation

Improvise the greenhouse by using old mosquito nets and plastic

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This project will generate income for me by growing seeds for other farmers. It will help other farmers to acquire Seedlings at a cheaper price and I be just charging them for the Labour. Seedlings are quite expensive. For example Tovista Seedlings cost between K1. 80 and K2. 10 meaning if one needs 1000 Seedlings, they part away with K 1,800 but growing your own Seedlings is cheaper by k800 as a packet of seeds is slightly below k1000.

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype uses a special kind of safe net while I use used mosquito nets and plastics.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can improve the lives of many farmers as they can easily erect their own greenhouse and grow their own Seedlings. It is relevant for as long as agriculture remains relevant
