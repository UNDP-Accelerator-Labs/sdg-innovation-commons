Circular Economy Portfolio - System thinking for a new strategic offer of the UNDP Bosnia and Herzegovina 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

UNDP in Bosnia and Herzegovina is interested in exploring how to apply the portfolio approach for a more strategic, relevant and coherent development offer in the area of circular economy as a lever to support the government, private sector and society re-think and re-orient the economic model towards sustainability. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

At present, there are no development stakeholders who support transition towards circular economy in the country at a system level. With the draft circular economy policy framework in place, there is a strategic opportunity for UNDP in Bosnia and Herzegovina to capitalise on its strong expertise in the areas of economic development, climate action, governance and design a strategic offer that will support renewal of the economic model of the country, towards low-carbon economy. At the same time, with the broader circular economy agenda at the EU level in place, the EU in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through its Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, has also prioritised support to the country to transition towards circularity.

UNDP has adopted its new Strategic Plan 2022-2025 that elevates UNDP’s aspiration to help achieve the SDGs and leveraging strategic innovation and the portfolio concept for change at scale. As a growing body of practice, UNDP globally is embracing the portfolio approach to develop new policy offers and capabilities in UNDP based on a system transformation logic, while nurturing interest and engagement from governments and donors to invest in this new logic.

Circularity is a development opportunity for Bosnia and Herzegovina's economy, which is in the early phases of transitioning to a functional market economy. From 2015 to 2020, the average annual growth rate of the GDP was a little under 2%. In recent years, Bosnia and Herzegovina's per capita GDP has been roughly 30% of the EU average, and substantial efforts are required to achieve convergence and close the gap.

Wholesale and retail commerce (14.57% of GDP), manufacturing industry (12.94%), public administration and defence (7.32%), and agriculture (5.6%) were the leading economic sectors in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2019, according to the BiH Agency for Statistics.

Industrial production has increased steadily in recent years due to economic expansion in major trade destinations, low labour costs, and a favourable tax climate. Small and medium-sized businesses account for 99.9% of all registered businesses in Bosnia and Herzegovina and over 70% of all employment and gross domestic product.

From 2015 to 2019, the resource productivity of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased marginally; nevertheless, in 2016, there was a decline in productivity due to an increase in domestic material consumption. The year 2020 was characterized by the COVID-19 crisis, which led to a decrease in resource productivity, mainly due to a drop in GDP relative to roughly constant domestic consumption. In 2020, Bosnia and Herzegovina's economy consumed 40,5 million tons of natural resources, which is 9.8 percent more than in 2015, the base year. Compared to 2015, domestic extraction of non-metallic minerals grew by 25.8%. According to the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, around 11.7 tons of agricultural crops, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels were consumed per capita in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2020, or 32 kilograms per day.

In 2021, the import coverage by export was 66.6%. Bosnia and Herzegovina exported goods worth 10.5 billion BAM to the EU market, while imports were 14.5 billion BAM.

In the context of waste management in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the rise of municipal waste in the country slowed significantly during the past year (1.2 million tons). In 2021, waste production per capita increased by 6% compared to 2010 despite a simultaneous decline in population. 74% of the population has access to waste management services, although the coverage varies greatly between urban and rural areas (80-90% in urban areas and 40-45% in rural areas).  

Coverage of the population by the waste collection service has expanded little over the years and is hampered mainly by infrastructural and operational limits, the resolution of which needs substantial expenditures and additional cash. Waste that is produced but not collected contributes to establishing illegal dumpsites. Bosnia and Herzegovina's territory has more than 1,400 illegal dumpsites. Their number is reportedly growing despite a slight rise in the population covered by waste collection services and a number of measures to close such dumpsites. In addition, separate garbage collection is not systematically addressed, which is mostly due to a lack of or insufficient recycling facilities. In addition to the absence of facilities for sorting and recycling, there are no financial incentives for residents to sort their waste, and public knowledge of the importance of effective waste management is extremely low. A small percentage of industrial and hazardous waste is repaired and utilized by industry. According to 2018 estimates, less than 10%14 of total industrial waste is utilized as secondary raw material.

The aforementioned statistics illustrate the situation of economic development in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is based on a linear economy with a very low GDP and an export-oriented production sector that cannot make the transition to a circular economy on its own.

On the other hand, BiH businesses understand the significance and benefits of the circular economy to their operations. 61% of organizations surveyed out of 338 are prepared to transition to conducting business in line with the principles of the circular economy, while over 80% understand the significance and contribution of the circular economy to the growth of their business.

The high import dependence, export-oriented production sector, low level of recycling and reuse of resources, as well as the significant interest of the commercial sector in integrating the principles of the circular economy, indicate a great economic potential of the circular economy through which Bosnia and Herzegovina could reduce its reliance on imports, maintain values and strengthen the local economy, and reduce the costs of waste treatment and disposal a great deal.

Given that UNDP in Bosnia and Herzegovina is designing the Circular Economy Portfolio internally for a start, the Country office partnered with Chora Foundation to get guidance and support in mapping the circular economy ecosystem and developing circular economy interventions as a package to instigate transition towards the circular economy in the country. After this more internal phase, the UNDP in Bosnia and Herzegovina will focus on a wide external range of partnerships with governmental, non-governmental and civil sectors and the donor community.
