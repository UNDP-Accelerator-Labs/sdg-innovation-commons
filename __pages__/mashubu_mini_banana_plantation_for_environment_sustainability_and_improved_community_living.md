> Title of the innovation

Mashubu mini Banana plantation for environment sustainability and improved community living

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is basically a banana farming project that is expected to be developed on a 8 hector land space. This will be implemented in four phases spread across two (2) years. The first phase targets about 500 hundred banana plants from there (3) varieties. The other stage or phases follows consequentially upon completion and certication of good work being done to each phase to when all the phases have been fully deposited. First 500 hundred plants are expected to generate the suckers for all the plantings of other phases. This is deliberately so, so as to be cost effective and efficient with the objectives of the project and provide maximum care, monitoring and supervision go the planted bananas to when there is certainty to the growth of the same plants.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project is expected to generate income from the selling of the banana offshoots to the already existing demand of the banana offshoots to both the local and the adjoining regions. The planted bananas are expected to generate about 10 suckers each plant and per year. These suckers are but fairly fetching on the market in terms of prizing. Secondly , the income is expected from the selling of the produce itself as in bananas themselves which are actually the main thrust for the banana project. A banana plant for example is expected to produce about 40 to 50 bunches of bananas in a year each banana bunch is expected to have about 180 to 220 banana fruits. Thirdly the project will at a reasonable cost be used for further but related studies to those seeking such related tasks or servo.

> Technical Feasibility

The said project is to be implemented on a  8 hectors land space where about 3000 banana plants will be planted all fry the 3 species. A bore hole is to be sunk from which water will be sourced for watering of the banana plants. A simple irrigation system is going to be applied to ensure that the project brings about high turn overs as in production.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is expected to stimulate employment for quite a number of categories like manufacturing, transport industry, marketing, good health to consumers of the bananas as in vitamins. Brings about balance in the circulation of the local currency which is good for but e economy, social, political and environmental being of the people.
