As supply chain demand a procedure of procurement is allowed, in this case on local basis, The product is designed according to speacification, as a small business we have to engage a number of skilled youths in a process. The youth have gained experience over time, whom we happy because we share the opportunity. Materials are bought for the completion of work. Having this exposal we aiming at implementing this business further beyond Lusaka such as rural areas to sustain the rural health system. we hope to carry along other partners so we can win big for our healthy country future. A further idea is being planned to expand to reached rural girl child using same material in education by  printing resivion material for school/
