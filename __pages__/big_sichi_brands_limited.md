BIG SICHI BRANDS LIMITED, is a management, marketing,advertising and entertainment company founded by a female DJ.It’s basis is for people to have fun with what they do and bring a whole different perspective to the business and entertainment mix while creating employment. BSB Brands bases its concept on the word magic... we recreate, adopt as well as market businesses and artists and also mould artist to not only depend on Thebes music aspect but also business aspects of making profits especially for the female folk as there are stereotypes as to how females artists cannot really make it in this business

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

For me the innovation will generate income through business adoption, marketing management and advertising and also through artist and music promotion and mentorship. For others it will most definitely create jobs for the graphic designers, marketing team, artists and for businesses it will expand their presence on the market and also promote their business as well us create new products that will Ben both attractive and affordable for all individuals.
Target market company’s of any sort and artist especially female artists 
The prize will help me with setting up an office buying some equipment and hiring a team to train the employees effectively for great results.
Just like magic innovation brings change and makes the world a better place with the ever changing trends

> Technical Feasibility

It’s a marketing, advertising and entertainment innovation that allows even people in the entertainment industry to both enjoy what they love to do as well as win in the corporate world

> Anticipated Social Impact

It’s relevant because our entertainment industry clearly doesn’t do much diversity. Our artists should be able to run both corporate businesses as well as do what they love to do even without endorsements they should be company owners and ceos
