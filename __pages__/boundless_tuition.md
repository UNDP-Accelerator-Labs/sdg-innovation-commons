> Title of the innovation

Boundless Tuition

> Brief description of the innovation

Boundless Tuition, trading under Boundless Innovations and General Trading, offers Quality affordable tuition to Primary, secondary and tertiary students in the Zambian market. The business is set to gain a strong market position through a coherent strategy. It has established clear steps to achieve its objective of becoming the preferred tuition service provider in Lusaka province and beyond in the next five years.

The business, acting as an agent, aims to create a web-based app and/or an android app that will match learners with suitable tutors and guarantee quality service to the client at affordable rates in a bid to make extra tuition accessible to the average Zambian learner through the three modes of delivery (i.e. online, on site and on call), thereby helping to reduce inequality in education and promoting quality education for all. We will also provide employment for qualified teachers (most of whom are unemployed) and ensure a comfortable and prompt pay for the tutor, thereby helping to reduce the poverty levels in the country. In this Covid era, Boundless Tuition is set to be the game changer, and its potential for positively impacting the Zambian community is simply boundless!

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Boundless Tuition teaches a variety of subjects within the scope of the Zambian curriculum as well as other curricula that our clients may be following (e.g. Cambridge). Our intention for setting up this business is to bridge the gap between the client seeking quality tuition (i.e. student or parent) and the qualified teacher looking to apply their skills to earn a living (i.e. the tutor), and of course to make profits through commissions and grow. 
The demand for private tutorial services is driven by the fact that most schools cannot meet the educational needs of all their students and also the need to ensure that students meet the educational standards nationally and internationally as well as get their grades up. This is where we come in; this is our niche and the demand for our services has never been greater.
We will initially serve primary and secondary learners and later grow to accommodate students in tertiary institutions and adult education candidates. Our target market comprises people of different class from all walks of life. We are coming into the tutorial/education industry with a business concept that enables us to work with students at different learning stages. 
All this is definitely possible, but with the Challenge prize, the possibilities are boundless. The prize will allow us to develop our web-based software and/or android application so that we can fully digitize our service. the Innovation fair and prize will also allow us to advertise massively in order to adequately penetrate the market and get our lions share. With the business mentorship program coming with the prize, we are confident of honing our entrepreneurial skills to ensure steady upward growth.

> Technical Feasibility

Through a web-based software and/or android app, qualified teachers will apply to be tutors and, after a rigorous interview and screening process, the successful candidates will be registered as Boundless Tuition tutors. 
The client (parent or student) will then log on and select the subject/s for which they require tuition and select their preferred tutor depending on qualifications, experience, proximity (in case of physical one-on-one tuition) and ratings from previous clients. The client is then redirected to a checkout page where there are various secure payment options, including mobile money which is more accessible to the average Zambian. The payment is made upfront with certain guarantees as stipulated in our terms and conditions. 
Boundless Tuition then links the client and the tutor and closely monitors progress to ensure quality delivery is upheld. Feedback from both the client and tutor will be invaluable. The tutor logs the hours/sessions worked onto our system and the client confirms if such hours/sessions actually happened. Tutor gets his pay at the end of the month according to the tuition hours/sessions. The business earns a taxable commission from the transaction.

> Anticipated Social Impact

One thing is certain, there will always be parents and students who would need that extra coaching or push in their education to be able to up their grades and achieve their educational goals. Therefore, a business such as ours will always be needed. 
This innovation will help the teachers to put their skills to good use and earn a living. The unemployed teachers will have employment, the already employed will have an extra source of income. This will definitely help reduce the poverty levels in the country.
This innovation will also help students to not only up their grades, but also gain the confidence they need to face various examinations and other challenges in life. 
Examinations have long been viewed as a barrier that continues to increase the inequality and the gap between the haves and the have-nots. The innovation will provide affordable quality tuition so that Zambians from all walks of life can have a chance at getting an education.
The girl-child is often left out when it comes to access to extra tuition because the parents are not sure if they can trust the tutor to remain professional. This innovation provides online tuition as a safe avenue for that girl child to access tuition from the safety of her home under the watchful eye of parents.
