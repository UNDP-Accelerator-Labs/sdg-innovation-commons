## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) from the perspectives of hard-to-reach and/or often marginalized communities, particularly the informal sector, urban-poor, women and rural and cross-border communities.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is to map implications of the AfCFTA for hard-to-reach and often marginalized groups (focusing on the informal sector, women, youth, urban poor and rural and cross-border communities), and identify and test solutions for them to be in a good position to take advantage of economic and social opportunities presented by AfCFTA.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The African Continental Free Trade Area is a free trade area which commenced trade on 1 January 2021, and includes 54 of the 55 members of the African Union. It is the largest free trade area in the world by population, and has its Secretariat in Accra, Ghana. The Agreement requires members to remove tariffs from 90% of goods allowing free access to commodities, goods and services across the continent, and it is hoped that this will boost intra-African trade significantly.  The Regional Bureau for Africa is supporting these efforts and recently signed an MOU with AfCFTA. At the same time, RBA has launched an Africa Borderlands Innovation Centre which covers Borderland Communities and issues of marginalisation and trade. AfCFTA has the potential to be an economic game changer, and we can already see larger multi-nationals positioning themselves to create and maximise opportunities - and various surveys/studies by the Ghana Statistical Service and UNDP Ghana Country Office are gathering data to support policy-makers.  However, we perceive many emerging gaps in understanding the implications of AfCFTA from the perspective of hard-to-reach and marginalised groups. Are messages about AfCFTA getting through? Do they understand these messages? What are perceptions about the implications for people's jobs? The informal sector is already engaged in cross-border trade between Ghana, within the ECOWAS sub-region and across the globe. What lessons can be learned from the experiences of the informal sector with cross-border trade to make the best use of AfCFTA and ensure no one is left behind.

> 

The AfCFTA has recently become operational, so there is not an extensive body of research or data on actual experience, however some of the key issues are set out on the Secretariat’s website and by the Borderlands Innovation Centre. However we do now that over 80% of the Ghanaian workforce is employed in the informal sector, and therefore the success of the trading bloc in Ghana, will depend on engaging with the informal sector and other groups to develop and support livelihoods.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The weak signals are largely based on media reports which indicate that some in the formal sector are not quite sure what AfCFTA means for them. There has been little tangible work on implications for the informal sector, rural communities (who are the bedrock of agriculture - a key sector for cross-border trade), and others. There has also been less discussion about existing, traditional informal trading arrangements, and what can be learned from these systems to make AfCFTA a success.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value will be a grassroots approach to understanding the implications and opportunities from AfCFTA, which documents people’s lived experiences including their hopes and concerns. By mapping these issues, we hope to create a live (dynamic) systems view as AfCFTA develops, involving hard-to-reach and marginalised groups to work with us to identify solutions to maximise opportunities from this trading bloc. Since the AfCFTA Secretariat is based in Accra, we believe that this provides an opportunity to engage directly with key policy makers. In addition Ghana will naturally be a testing ground for new initiatives and concepts from AfCFTA, and there will be opportunities to explore, map solutions and report on experiments across different policy options.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

AfCFTA is set to boost intra-African trade! AccLab Ghana is deploying innovative methods to illuminate the informal sector and marginalized groups. We will be exploring, mapping, and testing grassroots approaches to maximizing benefits of trade, so AfCFTA leaves no one behind.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Are government messages about AfCFTA getting through to hard-to-reach and/or often marginalised communities? And do they understand these messages? Are there signs of barriers and opportunities they see? What lessons can be learned from the existing structure/framework in cross-border trade between Ghana and the ECOWAS subregion to make the best use of AfCFTA and to ensure no one is left behind? Can their innovative approaches be learned and tested in other areas?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will approach the learning questions from the bottom-up perspective, instead of top-down. The focus will be on actions that people are taking - how people take the information they are being given a stage further and actually plan to grow their businesses across borders.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

AfCFTA is new and people we are trying to address (e.g., informal sector, rural, urban-poor, women and cross-border communities) cannot be normally reached by survey and/or online. We will also face the challenge of communicating in local languages in order to build communities' trust in us. This will probably involve a significant degree of cultural sensitivity and avoiding perceptions of imposing western ideas.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
