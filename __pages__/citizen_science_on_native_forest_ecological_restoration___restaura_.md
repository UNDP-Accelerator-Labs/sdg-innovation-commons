Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.

Overall goals: 

Create collaborative networks and connect different knowledge sources to promote the restoration of native forests. 

Study the phenology and standardization of Celtis tala employing collaborative tools within an open science framework. 

Specific goals: 

Learn about the different life cycles of the Tala (flowering, fructification, etc.) to plan when to collect seeds needed for the restoration projects. 

Determine the optimal planting date of Tala by conducting a collaborative experiment throughout its distribution in Argentina to locally adjust restoration strategies. 

Create collaborative tools for the restoration of native forests in different ecoregions through the replication of these activities with other species. 

Define the weak points of invasive exotic species in order to control them. 

Description of citizen participation: In the first part of the project, to learn about the different stages of the Tala's life cycle, the participants follow the same tree through its different stages of development, and report their results through a web app. In the second part, in order to determine the optimal planting date for the Tala, citizens simultaneously carry out a collaborative germination experiment in their homes or nurseries. In this context, monthly meetings are held in which preliminary results are informed and discussed and, in turn, participants help with the creation of future protocols. In future editions, in which stages 1 and 2 will be repeated, the aim is to let participants decide which species they want to continue working with according to the country's ecoregion. 

Time frame: 02/26/2021 - N/A.
