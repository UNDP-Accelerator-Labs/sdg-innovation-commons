My Budget Market

> Brief description of the innovation

My Budget Market is a marketing platform that intends to reach out to smart mobile phone users. Using an interface similar to ebay but unlike listing the products only one may be able to see the entire service provider services and price quotation helping them make their budget before reaching out to the physical shops,the pricing of products and services in virtual shops will help budgeting individuals to have an understanding of how much a product or service is faring on market price,Unlike The current practice of finding out the price of a product while at the service centers only to find it does not match the planned for expenditure, it's basically targeting smart consumption of products and services. It targets smart phone users because they are directly bombarded with pop-up ads on media, this app will also offer an ad blocker for premium subscription.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The product will generate income from service providers ranging from grocery shops market that will be enlisted on the platform, super markets, repair shops, individual service contractors, restaurants, hotels and lodges, those enlisted will be charged a fee for listing on the platform, and for special services individual user's will pay a periodical fee so minimal to an individual user allowing them access to VIP service on the web application, showing them where they could get a product just as equal for less the amount compared to other providers, a fee so minimal it encourages everyone to subscribe to premium service the less the premium the more consumption and in the end the more profit.

> Technical Feasibility

My Budget Market is a web site based application for marketing purposes, unlike the unwanted mostly irritating Pop up ads that this application is going to conviniently block giving the users a self accustomed preference of ads from services they actually are interested in. No prototype exists so far due to high cost of web application development by software engineers. However, it's user interface include virtual shops that one enters to browse, with a powerful searching crawler that helps users find the product and service they want and show them who can best serve their need.

> Anticipated Social Impact

No more expensive paper fliers that are handed to unsuspecting citizens in the streets which they later throw away tarnishing the streets with litter and the expenditure for print media is too high and rarely environment friendly because a lot of trees are turned into papers that will soon fill the bins even before they are out dated.
