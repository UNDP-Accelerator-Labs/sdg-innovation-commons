Overall goal:  Engage in dialogue with the entire community to answer the queries made by citizens when an arachnid is found, and, simultaneously, receive updated information about the species distribution and the likelihood of encountering them. • Resolve citizens’ doubts as to spiders and scorpions. • Generate a positive exchange of information between researchers and other citizens as to any issues which might arise from finding arachnids. • Contribute to the conservation of arachnids by sending data to the research team. • Make prevention and control measures available to the community in case species relevant to human health are found. 

Description of citizen participation: Participants of Spider or Scorpion? (“¿Es araña o scorpion?” in Spanish) are required to provide photographs and supplementary data on the spiders and/or scorpions found. Such photographs and data are sent by citizens by means of an app downloaded on their cell phones.
