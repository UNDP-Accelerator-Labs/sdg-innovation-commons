Problem: There was inadequate management of the forest within this partiality (communal land). There were forest fires, overgrazing, excessive felling of trees for firewood and commercialization, contamination of the area and fragmentation of the forest. All these situations in turn influenced that the collection and quality of water began to decrease.

Solution: A society was established where the tasks of caring for the forest could be distributed, inculcating activities such as: thinning, cleaning, sustainable logging, reforestation, maintenance of the greenhouse, among others. This with the aim of increasing water collection and quality.
