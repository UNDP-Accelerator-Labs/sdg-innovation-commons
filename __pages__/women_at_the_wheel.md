> Solution name

Women at the wheel

> Description

Women at the Wheel consists of a group of women with private cars who provide exclusive transportation services for women, children, and elderly people, as we prioritize the safety of passengers as well as the drivers.

The main advantage is that the drivers can manage their time and leave their homes to take pre-scheduled rides based on the contracts they handle each month, allowing them to budget their income. On the other hand, families receive support with caregiving tasks, especially in transporting their children or elderly adults.
