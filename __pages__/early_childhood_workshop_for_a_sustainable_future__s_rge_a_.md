Children's workshops will carry out full-time weekend educational activities with activist early childhood educators and experts from different disciplines, families and local organizations, with a 7R-focused curriculum (reuse, reduce, rethink, reflect, respect, redistrubute, recycle). Each workshop will prepare its own action plan for the project it deals with and develop it in accordance with the nature of action research in the process.
