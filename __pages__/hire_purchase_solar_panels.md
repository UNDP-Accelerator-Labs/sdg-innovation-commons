> Description of the solution

The hire-purchase business model for solar panels aims to provide households with off-grid access to affordable clean energy through solar panels. SolarNow is a solar company based in Uganda that previously sold, installed, and serviced high-quality modular solar home systems on a hire-purchase basis to mostly rural households and businesses. Customers were offered an affordable 12-month plan that typically involved a deposit on the system followed by 12 monthly installments, after which they own the system. SolarNow has now evolved into an energy solution provider supporting businesses as well as institutions in the Education, Healthcare, and Non-profit sectors.
