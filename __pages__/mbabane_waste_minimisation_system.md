About 48tonnes of unsegregated waste is generated per day  and directed to landfills resulting in a reduced lifespan for the city’s landfill and an unsustainable living environment for the city of Mbabane. Furthermore, unemployment remains high in the city, yet opportunities to derive livelihoods from waste exist for the city’s dwellers. Additionally, inappropriately managed waste can result in the outbreak of diseases. The absence of an appropriate legal instrument to promote sustainable waste management practices has resulted in the slow uptake of recycling and sustainable waste management practices. Additionally, current waste management practices have resulted in a big carbon footprint for the city. 

The solution aims at:

-        Promoting waste segregation as a social norm in Mbabane City

-        Enabling and encouraging legislation on waste segregation

-        Using waste to improve livelihoods by transforming waste management into sustainable business opportunities.

-        Introducing new Technologies of Composting (i.e. bokashi) – with the aim of improving soil nutrients, increasing yields for organic produce, thus improving livelihoods, and providing economic incentives for good environmental practices through, i.e. sale of organic compost and farmers produce from backyard gardens,

-        Reducing the city’s carbon footprint, as a climate action response,

The project is currently being piloted at 4 Mbabane communities (namely Pine Valley, Mbangweni, Woodlands and Msunduza) and 76 business outlets. The opportunities for income generation especially for the businesses, and the benefits currently observed make the potential for sustainability of this initiatives high. Additionally, through the learnings from this piloting phase and the passing of the Waste Management Regulations, the project will be scaleable to all other communities within the Municipal Council of Mbabane’s jurisdiction.
