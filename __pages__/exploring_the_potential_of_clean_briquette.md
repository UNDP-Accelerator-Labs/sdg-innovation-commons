## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Women and youth community-based organizations/associations are taking the lead on climate action initiatives in local communities.
2. Circular economy initiatives like those within the renewable energy and waste management sectors have great potential for job creation for women and youth, including creating new market and generating ne sources of revenue if the sectors.
3. Clean briquette production has the potential and capacity for large scale economic transformation for the betterment of youth and women
4. Paper was identified as another primary material for biochar production in the far-north region of the Country. If its fabrication process is improved and re-tested to work, then universities and public offices with longstanding documentation or papers which are not in use can be collected for better use instead of burning or depositing in landfills.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The system  faces a lot  bureaucratic bottlenecks. Large  unwillingness of public actors to accept new ways of working or  doing things

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These different data sources guided towards the holistic approach used. It was important to understand the dynamics surrounding the production of biochar. The team even undertook a gender and innovation lens approach to understand the why and how existing challenges stimulated ingenuity. Ethnographic methods enabled the lab to understand who were the most affected by community challenges, why and the different coping mechanisms used which also led to the discovery of cooking fuel made with paper. 


The different data sources used were complementary in addressing the gaps of existing and outdate literature and data on the subject matter. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The  different innovation methods used were necessary and  complementary as well. They helped not just to generate new insights/learnings, including an understanding of context,   but succeeded to engage communities  to understand the Lab' s work and benefit from the Lab's approach particularly with the use of positive deviants to replicate solutions identified within and across small community groups.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The team worked with Energetic Solutions for All (ESA), Youth Collective for peace and sustainable development, Association Action Ecologique et Protection de L' Environnement. 


The above mentioned CSO were the Lab team's main contact point in mobilizing lead users and positive deviants. First hand information on community challenges were captured from the heads of these organizations and in-depth understanding of the challenges and existing opportunities were provided by them following a series of exchanges.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The team worked with one researcher from the University of Maroua and a Data Science Expert from the University of Dschang. We worked together to do analyses of raw/primary data collected and generate insights based on observation and participation   in community. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Lab worked with NAME Recycling, the main competitor to the government recycling company within the framework of a workshop to take stalk of their actions and understand the stake

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Lab worked with the Ministry of Women Empowerment and the Family, Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation, Ministry of  Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises, Social Economy and Handicraft, and the Ministry of the Environment, Nature Protection and Sustainable Development during the exploration and sense making phase on circular economy. A workshop was organized with the mentioned ministries represented to rethink a circular economy model adapted to context, with potential for green job creation for young people. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

UNDP had been working with the Ministry of women empowerment before, but has never explored opportunities  with its specialized applied technical centre. The Lab leveraged existing technical expertise of the centre and is partnering with the team to put up a mini-biochar production unit to improve production and also ameliorate livelihoods in a long-run with new sources of revenue and new markets created, including capacity building modules for women and youth. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The different elements all together pushed our Lab's reflections further from just a circular economy lens to identifying specifically where there was most need and vulnerabilities to address. The consolidation of every information gathered helped to keep the flow of thoughts with continuous networking with youth and women-based associations whereby feedback opportunities are gradually contributing towards a "grow stage" of this learning cycle.
