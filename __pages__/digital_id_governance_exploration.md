## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Digital ID governance exploration 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



As Ethiopia is deploying digital ID system, the appropriate governance frameworks and models have tended to lag behind the sophistication of technical system. Despite the ongoing important efforts to rollout digital ID, the governance of identity system, particularly around the relationship of legal identity to digital identity require further exploration and guidance. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Government of Ethiopia is implementing a renewed National Identity (NID) Program, also known as Fayda ID, focused on rolling-out a digital identification system that is aligned with international best practices, including the Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development. Led by the National ID Program (NIDP), NIDP is a five-year program (2021 – 2026) set to introduce a new nation-wide foundational digital ID to offer an inclusive, residence-based, and digital identification system, and ultimately support Ethiopia’s digital transformation agenda. NIDP initiative has been implemented in various phases, including an initial pilot period, to enable lessons learned, local knowledge enhanced and technical iterations prior to a scale-up and nation-wide roll-out throughout the country. However, as countries are deploying digital ID systems the appropriate governance frameworks and models have tended to lag behind the sophistication of technical systems. Despite the ongoing important efforts to provide governance frameworks for digital identity, it is UNDP's assessment that countries implementing or renewing their ID systems broadly require further guidance on the governance of identity systems, particularly around the relationship of legal identity to digital identity. 





> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The user value of digital ID is imperative for its success and sustainability. Implementation of digital ID and digital public infrastructure (DPI) implementations broadly – reveal governments must plan to realize the tangible from identity systems. The incentive to participate is true for both people and government institutions may to different degrees benefit through either cost-reducing, risk-reduction or service-improvement from integrating with national ID systems and allowing people to verify and authenticate themselves. Therefore, accelerator lab will bring in the user perspective to the digital ID promotion efforts being made by government and partners. From our assessment, the users perspective looks neglected or intentionally overlooked by many stakeholders including government. 

Accelerator lab will conduct the below activities using the lab methodologies. 



Articulation and analysis of 3-4 key use-case, including their benefits for different groups, gaps in achievement (technical, legal, institutional, capacity, etc.) and indicative numbers of the human and/or
economic potential of realizing the use cases.

Identification of potential governance gaps, mapping using UNDP's Model Governance Framework, and tangible proposals (staff, costs, time) for interventions required to plug gaps.

Support development of a (fundable) proposition for added governance interventions (if required) to ensure rights-based, inclusive and user value-driven digital ID implementation in Ethiopia.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



We will articulate and analyze digital ID use-cases, including its benefits for different groups, gaps in achievement (technical, legal, institutional, capacity, etc.) and indicative numbers of the human and/or economic potential of realizing the use cases and  identify potential governance gaps to ensure digital legal identity systems are valuable for people, accountable and rights protecting

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.







The partners wish to cooperate in areas digital ID governance gap analysis and use case articulation for Ethiopia. In cooperation with the government of Ethiopia represented by the National ID Program (NIDP), UNDP proposes to support with staff from CDO and BPPS, Ethiopia Country Office (CO), UNDP Accelerator Lab, ID Program experts from UNDP Malawi CO and a consultant (deployed through CDO to the country office) to undertake the governance assessment and use case articulation. The digital ID governance gap assessment and use case articulation is expected to inform further Digital ID governance interventions
for UNDP and NIDP.  The initial engagement includes a 9-week assessment and analysis period, 2 weeks of which are going to require daily participation by strategic and technical staff at NIDP and associated MDAs.
