Accessing Public Services has always been a daunting experience for the everyday citizen. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this has become a critical Public Health challenge. Ummo is a mobile platform that improves how the public accesses government service information, as well as empower participation in the delivery and management of those public services. In 2020, Ummo piloted its service delivery solution at the Matsapha Revenue Office (Tommy Kirk shopping complex). In doing so, Ummo created job opportunities for two agents and saved over a hundred hours of queuing time for its customers. Ummo is on track to launch its mobile app which will host all Public Service information and enable citizens to participate in rating the performance of a given service - increasing the accountability of public administrators and leaders. This is also inline with the government's anti-corruption mandate. By focusing on our society’s public service challenges and creating job opportunities for service agents, Ummo’s “COVID-19 Objective”, as well as its 2021 plans is to aid in the kingdom’s economic recovery plan. Ummo’s SDG targets are to be one of the key drivers of Goal 1, Goal 8 and Goal 16 in the kingdom.
