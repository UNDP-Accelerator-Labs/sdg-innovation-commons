This initiative is centered on helping new literacy and Language graduates on staying useful and relevant to the educational system of Zambia. The primary goal of this initiative is to help carry out research on the sustainability and suitability of literacy and numeracy programmes in Zambian primary schools.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The generation of income will be based on funding from cooperate partners and many other organisations and we aim to be a substantial research initiative that will be carrying out various research projects in the field of education for different parties. By doing so, we hope to be able to fund and sustain our operations.

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation plan for this project will be based primarily on recruiting youths, newly graduates of literacy and Language as we believe these are specialists in literacy programmes and policies. As the recruitment process will be done, we hope to lure funders and various institutions to support our initiative.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This initiative will help a great deal of youths in the field of education who are mostly stranded after graduation. Additionally, the initiative will ensure that the ministry of general education makes relevant and well informed decisions that would see to it that the background of pupils education is as strong and relevant as it should be.
