The Bangladesh Accelerator Lab organized a Women’s Digital Innovation hackathon to promote ICT skills and innovation practices to female students and professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of SDG challenges. The winning solution that came up from this solution was one that aims to address the persistent challenge of waste detection, segregation, and collection. A Self-Controlling Spider Robot was designed by the first prize winning team of the hackathon. The robot's purpose is to collect, detect, and separate wastage for a model Smart City. The solution would use technologies such robot technology, sensor technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. The solution is particularly timely as garbage management is a huge challenge in Bangladesh and if not managed properly, not only will diseases increase but will also lead to soil, air and water pollution. The picture shows the members of the team that designed this solution.
