## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

GeoAI Platform for monitoring Air pollution hotspots
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that air pollution monitoring for brick manufacturing (brick kiln) industry is not upto the mark and there is a lack of monitoring tools available to the regulatory authorities

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Air Pollution Monitoring has advanced in India but very little work on concrete abatement mechanisms Awareness on air pollution is present in tier-1 cities of North India but that is not driving behavior (not wearing mask or using air purifiers) Public investments in air pollution multiplied from less than $1million in  2018 to $600 million in 2020. This will multiply further in 2021-26 Innovations in air pollution are at nascent stage in India, conducted in university labs or startups.  UNDP is almost a very small player in air pollution sector in India in 2019. Accelerator Lab sensed need for Air Pollution Portfolio in the next country plan. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Every winter, more than 140 million Indians are exposed to severe air pollution when the AQI crosses the hazardous mark of 300. Source apportionment studies reveal that the brick manufacturing sector contributes to 8-15% of North India's air pollution, which is nearly a quarter of the total pollution contributed by industrial emissions.

 The research paper ‘Slavery from Space’  from the University of Nottingham showcased a novel approach of using geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence to detect the exact locations of brick kilns using satellite imagery. We connected with the University and teamed up with researchers from Rights Lab who are focussed on creating impact through research to help us identify such air pollution hotspots in India.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We have used both structured and unstructured data coming in from sensors, surveys, satellite data, and mobile data, socioeconomic data, administrative data, and open data across our portfolio of solutions. We have also created data partnerships and collaboratives to tap into some of the data sources.  We are adding lot of new value to the air pollution sector and providing new intelligence through some of these alternative, unconventional datasets.  
The GeoAI platform demonstrated how environmental non-compliance can be detected from space using artificial intelligence. It significantly reduces the humongous task and investments required to regulate each and every industrial unit in India. For instance, the challenge of monitoring about 8,000 brick kilns in Bihar was brought down to less than 4,000. It is a novel approach for improving regulatory governance in India. The GeoAI platform brings together coordinated action from diverse stakeholders – regulators, government agencies, civil society, and volunteer groups to tackle the complexity around brick kilns.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are excited to introduce the #GeoAI platform to better regulate brick kilns of #Bihar. It is a 1st of its kind app detecting environmental compliance using #spacetech & #AI. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=TgUDd4sv5JM&feature=emb_logo

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

We are partnering with Bihar State Pollution Control Board to roll out the GeoAI platform in their state. This agency is the key environment regulator for monitoring air pollution in the state of Bihar https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/mou-inked-to-check-pollution-through-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/80773918.cms

-Technical collaboration & data partnership for GeoAI platform: The research paper ‘Slavery from Space’  from the Rights Lab, University of Nottingham showcased a novel approach of using geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence to detect the exact locations of brick kilns using satellite imagery. After the research identified 47,000 precise locations of brick kilns, we connected with the University and now have a technical and data collaboration.  AccLab has repurposed their research for air pollution and extended the research to classify brick kilns based on the environmental (non) compliance using AI algorithms and citizen science. This data is now part of the back-end of our technology platform (app+web-based) which is now being used by state environmental regulators for state wide implementation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can a GeoAI platform improve environmental non-compliance for the brick kiln industry? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are introducing new methodologies through the above innovation methods. By generating targeted geo-intelligence (generated through satellite data, machine learning and citizen science), we are tackling challenges faced by environmental regulators to address large number of sources of air pollution spread across India.  We have used hackathons to identify unconventional solutions such as nature-based solutions for indoor air pollution. We are trying new methodology 'SDG Objects of Intersectionality' for sharp targeting of geographical hotspots/objects where multiple SDGs converge. For example we are working on brick kilns - hotspots of extreme air pollution, soil degradation, water degradation, bonded labor, child labor. (7 SDGs meet) 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

After the research identified 47,000 precise locations of brick kilns, we had multi-stakeholder consultations with government agencies and civil society. We have taken this proof of concept to the states of Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh for state-wide implementation.  
The goal is to make this into a pan-India platform and collaborate with national partners and build capacities of local authorities to strengthen regulatory governance by using GeoAI technology platform and enforce environmental and labor regulations in the brick manufacturing industry
