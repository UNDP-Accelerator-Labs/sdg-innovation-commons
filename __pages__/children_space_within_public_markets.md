Vendors of two major public markets in Mexico City, Mercado Jamaica and Mercado Merced, have started a cooperative group and children spacefor all the vendors' children that otherwise wouldn't have a place to be and/or someone to look after them while their parents work.



The spaces make use of former storage rooms, roof and administration spaces of the market.



The vendors take turns organizing activities like printmaking, games, music, or sports.
