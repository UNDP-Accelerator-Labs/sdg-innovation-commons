Enabling Innovation Ecosystem - Iraq
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is a weak innovation ecosystem in Iraq that contributes to increasing the unemployment rate among Iraqi youth.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In October, 2020, The Iraqi Government launched the White papers with several national and international entities in the Economic Sector in Iraq. “The White Paper is a comprehensive programme that sets out a clear roadmap to reform the Iraqi economy and address the accumulated, decades-old serious challenges that confront it. This paper provides a detailed outline of the factors that have distorted the Iraqi economy, undermined its capacity to provide a decent life for large numbers of Iraqis, and its failure to keep pace with the economic developments that the world has witnessed.” (gds.gov.iq, 2020). 

The expansion of the Iraqi government's role and the emergence of a command economy in Iraq are the main key causes of the crisis. this is a return back to the nationalization of vital economic sectors in the 1970s to the commandeering of all economic levers by the state to support the war effort in the 1980s, through the period of sanctions imposed on Iraq in the 1990s, these shocks, as well as the absence of strategic planning, mismanagement, maladministration, patronage, and misguided political ideology, all led to an expansion of the role of the state in all aspects of economic life in Iraq.

In addition,  the Iraqi economy continued to be directed by the state after the events of 2003 because of the failure of creating a dynamic system and a diversified modern economy as outlined in Iraq’s Constitution, and instead continued to rely on the state as the almost only driver of economic activity in the country.Therefore, in 2019, the demonstration movement began to increase and continue by the local community, specifically young people throughout Iraq, calling for the provision of job opportunities, the development of the economic reality, and the improvement of the educational system.

So, from the beginning of  2020 until the mid of  2021, the UNDP - Accelerator Lab in Iraq worked on sensing and exploring activities that focused on the causes of increasing the youth unemployment rate in Iraq and the roots of the limited innovation environment in Iraq and identified the gaps and defined potential opportunities that can empower the iraqi youth and achieve the diversity in economic opportunities in Iraq. 

Academic Sector: There are different causes and drivers for the limited innovation environment in Iraq, mainly within the education system, public and private institutions, and the overall culture in Iraq. To start with, the higher education system in Iraq depends mainly on offline and traditional teaching methods. First, it is based on memorization of material and not thinking outside the box, and creating something new. Adding to that, students in universities don’t aspire to learn more than what is written in the official textbooks. Third, teachers and professors inside universities have limited access to online tools and innovation tools to support their own personal development and students’ development. Most importantly, the enabling institutional environment to enhance the innovation culture is just forming.

Private Sector: The private sector also helps in escalating this problem because

First, the private sector in Iraq is very small, this is because private companies focus on traditional business with limited opportunities and don’t consider expanding or diverging their operations to include different sectors. Mainly the sector is focused on real estate, and car trade, and focuses mainly on importing not manufacturing. Hence, limiting the need for innovation and diversification of economic opportunities to benefit wider youth groups. The public and private institutions structure in Iraq is inherited from the social system, such systems largely focus on creating economic opportunities for all, of course, this is in theory since now corruption is eliminating this benefit, and they don’t tend to create the environment, policies, and functions that enhance competition and drive innovation.

The accumulated factors resulted in producing individuals who have limited capacities to think out of the box and innovate, and who have a low tendency to take risks. Adding to that, the policies don't encourage the embeddedness of innovation and the initiation of local startups.  The stakeholders involved in this challenge include the youth themselves, the public sector, the private sector, universities, I/NGOs, and entrepreneurs. These stakeholders are the main drivers for the innovation ecosystem in Iraq and are directly involved to affect the tunnel vision of employment among the Iraqi youth. The current situation of the innovation environment in Iraq can be analyzed and described based on culture, the provision of common spaces, the institutional structure, and the access to finance to develop innovative ideas. 

These factors are detailed below:  First, the culture in Iraq is not innovation and business-oriented in general. This is mainly because of the years of wars that led citizens to be risk-averse, hence starting a business is not a common option for young people, and usually, it is not encouraged by the community.  Second, there is a lack of an enabling culture environment to enhance innovation like common spaces, innovation hubs, and accelerators and incubators. Youth around Iraq miss the opportunity to have a common space specialized for young people to meet up, brainstorm, and work on their projects. With the presence of limited opportunities for youth to build healthy networks and healthy relationships.  Third, public and private institutions in Iraq do not have clear and communicated visions or policies to empower youth and direct them to innovate especially in the field of business and entrepreneurship.

The added value of supporting youth in those fields is not well realized. Is resulting in poor communication and poor approach (usually institutions adopt a charity-based approach to dealing with youth). 

Moreover, there is a lack of capacity among those institutions to utilize the opportunity of working with young people. Youth available capacities are not fully utilized in inactivated fields like agriculture, industry, and services sector, considering the high demand in these fields.  Fourth,  there is limited access to finance to experiment and implement innovative ideas. Youth in Iraq has very limited opportunities when it comes to access to finance; the main source of financial support would be their close family members. While financial support from the private sector remains very limited and not well organized or visible. On the other hand, bank loans take a very long time and it requires guarantees not obtainable by many young people. In general, banks do not have faith or trust in start-ups, especially those led by youth.

The limited enabling innovation environment in Iraq affects the wheel of development in the economic, social, environmental, and other aspects, whether in the short and long term, below will explain the undesired effects.   Economic Effects:  First, It will make the country's economy dependent on two sides. The first is dependence on importing foreign products and commodities, and thus it will burden the state on the foreign currency, and cause weakness in supporting local production and developing the private sector, especially the industrial sector. Second, In the long term, these limitations will lead to the de-escalation of the innovation wheel at the level of individuals, institutions, and companies emanating from the stakeholders themselves.  This will lead to solutions that are not sustainable and may not be fit to solve the current problems because they arise from other countries and communities and not the local community. Third, the lack of innovation will decrease the establishment of new startups which means the job opportunities will be limited and focus on employment in public sectors and large companies. As we knew, the public sector has already suffered from underemployment and the private sector suffered from a lack of investment. 

Social Effects:  First, when people depend on importing solutions and products from other counties and communities without there being innovation from themselves or compatibility with the local reality and the real need of the beneficiaries. This will negatively affect their sense of responsibility towards their place in and the society they live with. the system will be not adaptable to emergency crises and rapid dynamic changes in the world. Second, day by day, the opportunity of innovation from youth will decrease because of the lack of success stories, which means there are bad effects on the cultural and scientific level of Iraqi society because in this case there will be no incentives to develop skills and develop the capabilities of minds for more inventions. Especially since the current education system in schools and universities depends heavily on spoon-feeding. Environment Effects: First, Iraq is an oil country, and its economy depends on oil imports, and as we know that the age of industries dependent on fossil fuels will become extinct because the world is working on the use of renewable energies and focusing on how to reduce environmental pollutants and reduce the phenomenon of climate change. Thus, the lack of innovations in the field of environment, energy, and climate at the local level will cause future environmental problems at a local level. The Iraqi government will face an international responsibility to protect the environment globally. Second, on the one side, Iraqi young people have brilliant mindsets for innovation and creativity, on the other side, the universities and colleges have rich theoretical environmental knowledge and inventions but they don’t have an innovative way of working to implement this information and solutions fitting with the current needs because of the limited enabling innovation environment and ecosystem, especially in environment, energy, and climate.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

First, Iraq is not among the top innovator countries either globally or regionally. Globally, there is a lack of data globally on the innovation status in Iraq. The Global Innovation Index for The Global Economy does not include Iraq; Iraq is not even ranked according to its innovation due to a lack of data. https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Iraq/GII_Index/ . Adding to that, regionally Iraq is not among the top 10 innovative countries in the MENA:  https://altahreernews.com/2508/  

Second, the number of undergraduate students and graduates from the Iraqi public universities is essential to the innovation environment in Iraq as these youth will be the core and the fresh minds to drive the innovation ecosystem as the near future will rely on their capabilities and motivation:

First, recently, many publications are addressing innovation in Iraq, hence driving the urgency to focus on innovation.

 First, there is a publication on Revitalising Science, Technology and Innovation in Iraq http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Iraq/pdf/RevitalisingSTI_inIraq_Roadmap.pdf. Second, there is another publication by Science, technology, and innovation exploring innovation in Iraq and how decades of instability affected the innovation ecosystem in Iraq. https://stiiraqdev.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/innovation-in-iraq-context/ . Also, some magazines are publishing about innovation and how it is essential for entrepreneurs in Iraq, more information can be found here: BusinessLandscapeII_Web.pdf (kapita.iq)  All these publications aim to set the ground for innovation in Iraq, mainly focusing on how innovation has a role in creating entrepreneurial opportunities for youth.  

Second, also, there have been initiatives focusing on fostering an innovation culture in Iraq. One such initiative is Iraqi Innovators, which is aiming at creating a culture for innovation in Iraq, more information on the NGO can be found here: https://iraqtech.io/ . Also, other co-working spaces, innovation hubs, and accelerator labs are focusing on innovation in Iraq: https://the-station.iq/ and https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/oxfam-innovation-lab/. 

Third, also, cooperation between the different actors is happening in order to enhance the culture of innovation and expand entrepreneurial opportunities in this regard: https://www.arabnet.me/english/editorials/events/hubs-iraq-hackathon.  Hence there are some efforts to establish innovation grounds in Iraq and this is the time to build on these innovations and start enhancing the innovation-enabling environment in Iraq.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

First, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will focus on exploring the fundamental reasons for the limited innovation environment in Iraq and work on policy-level changes to embed tools for innovation within Iraqi institutions.  The Accelerator Lab focuses on the local community-prioritized challenges to innovation. AccLab is using innovative and localized ways to sense and explore the reasons for the lack of innovation in Iraq and to enhance the innovation culture within youth. The AccLab in Iraq will use localized training material to empower the local community to decide on its most prominent challenges.  Second, The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use unusual sources of data in order to understand the nature of the innovation environment in Iraq. The UNDP-AccLab will work on finding innovative methods to acquire data on innovation in the newly liberated areas.  Third, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use innovative methodologies to spark thinking in an innovative way with our partners. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will work on embedding innovative methodologies like future thinking and behavioral insights within the work of government partners on the ministry level. Adding to that, the UNDP-AccLab will work on embedding innovative methodologies into the thinking of teachers and students within the higher education system in Iraq. Fourth, The UNDP- AccLab in Iraq will focus on building several partnerships at various levels and bridges between the beneficiaries in order to share lessons learned, insights, information, and experiences on an ongoing basis, while investing in the local resources available between them. These partnerships will enhance the connectivity in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq and embed that in the UNDP. Fifth, mapping, experimenting and scaling new sustainable development local solutions in a portfolio approach to tackle the mentioned challenge. Encouraging the bottom-up approach is one of the main activities of the lab since these local solutions are coming from the heart of the problem by the locals who lived it day in and day out. Mainly the lab is within a huge network of locals that eases the process of tapping the actual need in the innovation environment in Iraq. Sixth, learning is the main part of the work cycle of the accelerator lab where the lab is capable of scaling the indigenous knowledge and the lab’s insights into a systemic change within a small period of time. In addition, the UNDP AccLab Iraq already has more than 200 local solutions that are tackling the youth and Unemployment challenges in Iraq. Also, a big network with local innovators and citizen is well developed during the past three years that will allow the UNDP-CO to access the indigenous knowledge and different insights

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the cutting-edge approaches, local solutions’ types, and portfolio factors that induce policy-level change to the weak Iraqi innovation ecosystem in the aim of empowering youth and supporting in decreasing the high unemployment rate in Iraq.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

System Thinking: The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use systems thinking at the start of sensing, exploring, and experimenting in order to map the system, the active stakeholders, and the existing gaps and opportunities. This will enable us to find the critical points for intervention. 

Prototyping: The UNDP -AccLab will use Prototyping And MVP for developing the second phase of two digital solutions, the first one is Startup Bus and the second one is Online mentorship. 

Human-Centered Design: Human-Centered Design: the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use human-centered design approaches, specifically Design Thinking, in order to support the portfolio approach and embed an innovation mentality within the mindset of Iraqi youth. This will also support the portfolio approach by directing youth mentality to find innovative solutions that tackle the existing gaps.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1- There is a lack of sensor and sensor network data in Iraq, especially data that take a long-term perspective on the most suitable methods, tools, and local solutions that survive sustainable development. 

2- It is difficult for decision-makers/ enablers or those working in the field of development institutions to identify accurate and specific gaps and opportunities in entrepreneurship due to the weakness of using innovative analysis tools that depend on users' journeys of key players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. 

3- In Iraq, data is scarce, there is a lack in both quantitative and qualitative data. In terms of quantitative, there is a gap in reporting actual numbers and many different sources have different numbers, hence this hinders access to information. Adding to that, qualitative data that explore the individual psychology and the effect of the culture and.  

4- There is a lack of sources of data about the innovation environment in Iraq, especially in newly liberated areas. Hence, there is a need to know who are the active players, the existing efforts and initiatives, and the possible collaborations to enhance the innovation environment. 

Overall, these new sources of data will be the core insights for the innovation environment enablers in Iraq in order to design programmes and activities that match the targeted segment needs.
