Gaza Emergency Investor Pipelines
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



UNDP/PAPP recognizes that the private sector is pivotal to complement, accelerate and enhance the sustainability of recovery and reconstruction efforts. Attracting investments from local, diaspora, or international investors whose goals align with the evolving recovery and reconstruction plans is essential. To incentivize investments, it is crucial to provide evidence-based business cases and bridge information gaps for the private sector and present de-risking schemes.

 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The ongoing war has caused large-scale destruction and exacerbated pre-existing humanitarian needs, thus depriving Gazans of their basic human rights, including access to electricity, water and sanitation, healthcare, and education.

As highlighted by the Gaza Strip Interim Damage Assessment - a joint report released on 2 April 2024 by the World Bank Group and United Nations with financial support from the European Union - the estimated damage to infrastructure in Gaza through January 2024 exceeds $18.5 billion, which is equivalent to 97% of the total GDP of Gaza and the West Bank combined, in 2022. Residential buildings make up most of the recorded damage (72%), followed by damages to critical infrastructure and services such as education, WASH, health, energy, ICT, municipal services and transport (19%), as well as infrastructure damages in the commerce, industry, and services sector (9%). As 92% of primary roads have been destroyed, this will further compound challenges to future recovery and reconstruction efforts. According to UNEP, the amount of debris generated is estimated to be more than 37 million tons, and debris removal may cost around $620 million.

Additionally, the war has had a severe impact on the entire Palestinian economy. According to

estimates of the socio-economic impact assessment of the Gaza War on the State of Palestine by UNDP and ESCWA, nine months of war could lead to a staggering 29% loss of GDP compared to pre-war

projections for 2023 and 2024. Unemployment levels are expected to soar to 7.8%, and poverty rates are projected to surge from 38.8% to 60.7%, leading to an increase in the number of people living in poverty by an additional 1.86 million. Additionally, human development in the West Bank and Gaza will face

significant setbacks of over 16 and 20 years, respectively

Against this backdrop and in alignment with national reconstruction and development priorities and in consultation with local, national and international actors, UNDP/PAPP has developed an integrated Gaza Early Recovery, Reconstruction and resilience plan with a set of phased interventions that can be implemented at scale as soon as the security and access conditions allow across three key pillars of: 1) Essential

public and social infrastructure and services, 2) Inclusive economic recovery and 3) Inclusive governance.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab along with UNDP relevant team in Gaza aim 

to develop an Emergency Investor Map. This tool will highlight investment

opportunities emerging from early recovery planning, creating a win-win

situation by directing private capital into areas that can accelerate recovery

and reconstruction efforts in Gaza in collaboration with UNDP/PAPP and other

development actors. By proposing feasible social and business models, the map

will help identify priority sectors and initially evaluate opportunities for

private sector engagement to support the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip. The

proposed Emergency Investment Pipelines for Gaza aim to:

Contribute to close the Gaza recovery and reconstruction financing gap by identifying and

developing investment-ready and impactful investment opportunities

Bridge the information disparities between potential

private sector financing, profitable and impactful investment opportunities and

actual investment, fostering the attraction of private capital

  

Enable the flow of private investment through derisking,

blended finance and/or guarantee mechanisms, and

Utilize impact analysis and impact management to ensure

integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of investments to meet stakeholder

needs.

This tool will guide and inform the dialogue and agreements with the private sector as impact investors and derisking donors on their engagement to accelerate Gaza recovery and reconstruction. The tool could be used by senior management and UNDP team across the different programmatic pillars as well as our partners at the government since it will align with the national recovery and reconstruction plans.
