## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Navigating Informality in Food Supply Chains
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the informal food system of Zimbabwe is relational and there is an information gap in understanding how the system has been functioning or not functioning because of COVID19. The supply and demand and movement of food is dependent on the relationships of individuals, vendors, transporters, farmers and organizations that influence the way in which food is brought into and taken out of a city. The advent of COVID19 may have had an effect on the relations within the network for continued supply and access of food. The proposed challenge seeks to understand the network of actors in the food system of Harare specifically looking at Mbare Musika which is the biggest wholesale food market in Zimbabwe. The challenge will juxtapose the network before COVID19 and during COVID19. The learnings generated may help inform data driven town planning for market reorganization to improve resilience in informal food systems in Harare.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Before 2020, studies around the economic hub of Mbare Musika have centred around the classification of economic activities, commodities, the interconnectedness of its stakeholders and the influence of dynamic system changes to its operation. Such studies include analysing the municipality data on informal economy actors on the performance of the Agri-market (Gibbon 1995), the “middleman” role of vendors/transporters between Mbare Musika and Harare suburbs in averting food insecurity by creating informal food distribution systems in communities(Mustafa et al 1999) and the efficiency of service provision in economic hubs like Mbare Musika in decentralization exercises under local authorities (Masuko & Nyoni 1995). These early studies on the Agri-market bring to the forefront the influential factor of networks and ecosystems on Mbare Musika as a micro-economy. In the latest study published in July 2020 on Mbare Musika, the resilience of the market is premised on the creation of collaborative relationships and networks that are evolving in response to state interventions that aim to restructure the marketplace and the flow of produce (Chikulo et al 2020). This study interrogated the functions of Mbare Musika before the COVID19 pandemic and therefore there is an information gap in relation to the functions of Mbare Musika during the pandemic. Could the pandemic have caused increased food insecurity in urban areas because the networks in Mbare Musika was affected by lockdowns and COVID19 restrictions and compliance? Has the proliferation of informal food markets (outside of municipality structures) been caused by the disruption of the existing networks?

Traditional Food Markets:Power Relations And Waste Management: A Qualitative Study Masvingo, Zimbabwe
The study was in Masvingo. They were trying to understand the changing connections between farmers and
delivery to markets during COVID19. Although the study primarily focused on lack of access to markets it shows that there is evidence that actors within the network were affected by COVID19.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There is a data gap in understanding how Mbare Musika is working during COVID19 and this data is needed to inform the process of market re-organization which UNDP Zimbabwe is planning to invest approximately 3.5million USD in the next 3years. The Accelerator Lab's learnings and insights will help with building back better to create equitable, sustainable and human centred market spaces.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Zimbabwe Accelerator Lab is working on understanding the network of relationships in the food market of Mbare Musika to inform market re-organization to build resilient food supply chains in urban areas.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

If we study the network of relationships in Mbare Musika food market during COVID19 the we will be able to inform equitable market re-organization

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioural Insights: an investigation will be done on the motivations of peoples actions and choices within Mbare Musika and how these have changed during COVID19. This will help inform our understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in food markets in relation to human behaviour of the stakeholders within markets in times of shock or crisis
Co-creation: this will help us understand how different stakeholders within the food markets can co-create the working/trading environment in Mbare Musika and inform the market re-organization process.
Human Centred Design: by understanding how people interact with spaces, this will help us draw learnings on market re-organization
Social Network Analysis: the informal food market is based on relationships. We will analyse the social network of Mbare Musika to help understand the movement of information of food and stakeholders. This will help inform the market re-organization process
Systems Thinking: by understanding the network in Mbare Musika we can see how the web of the network is interlinked to other players and stakeholders in government, civil society and private sector. This will help inform the need for a systems thinking approach in the market re-organization process

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Geospatial Data: this is to assess if there has been any change in landscape, buildings, land use during COVID19
Drone and Satellite Data: this is to understand better the clustering of people and market use during COVID19 versus pre-COVID19
Focus Group: we will bring in a set of stakeholders from Mbare Musika to do a deep dive into what changes have occurred in the network over the past year in the food market
Direct Interviews: This will be done through one on one interviews with individuals within Mbare Musika to understand how they now work and relate with other stakeholders during COVID19 versus pre-COVID19
Observation: this will be done by observing Mbare Musika and its environs during the COVID19 pandemic to understand how people relate with markets
The findings will be synthesised to understand how Mbare Musika is currently working and how each stakeholder is influencing the changes. This will help inform the market re-organization process.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This challenge can help the city councils in Zimbabwe as the model can be replicated in understanding how wholesale markets are now functioning in urban areas and inform contextual localized market re-organization. Secondly, it could help the Ministry of Local Government as it begins its process of devolution. Cities will begin functioning more autonomously and the understanding of how to create resilient markets in a decentralized setting could be assisted by the learning cycle of this challenge. We will need to cement stronger relationships with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Local Government who signs off on new projects that are implemented in cities.
