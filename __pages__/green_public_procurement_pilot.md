## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring Public Procurement as a potentially strategic instrument for achieving sustainable development goals
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is on how to ensure the wider uptake of the strategic public procurement that would respond to societal, environmental and economic objectives of the country. In this particular experiment, we would like to learn more on enablers and impediments of using the public procurement process to achieve environmental policy goals relating to climate change, resource utilization (primarily energy efficiency) and sustainable consumption and production – especially given the importance of public sector spending on goods, services and works in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Bosnia and Herzegovina was identified as a potential candidate for EU membership by the European Commission in 2015, and since then signed a number of agreements with the EU, including the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which all calls for the transposition of the EU acquie communitaire in the national legislation. Public Procurement Law has been partially aligned with the EU Directives, but not with the latest one from 2014 which seeks to ensure greater inclusion of common societal goals in the procurement process, including environmental protection, combating climate change, and other social and environmental considerations. Public procurement is still seen as a common administrative process, not as an instrument that can drive system changes in the field of environment, innovation and social inclusion. The market for sustainable products and services is underdeveloped, as there is not enough demand. In this experiment, we want to

The volume of public sector spending on goods, services and works in Bosnia and Herzegovina position green public procurement as a potentially major accelerator and driver of the development of the market for environmentally sound and energy-efficient goods and services. The volume of public sector spending recorded in the national e-Procurement system in 2019 was USD 1.73 billion, in 2018 USD 1.82 billion, which doesn't include the small-value procurements which contract award notices are not recorded in the e-Procurement system.  Some 2672 public organizations contribute to the public expenditure.

- The informal group of MEPs submitted a motion in early 2020 to amend the Public Procurement Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina and include „green public procurement“ as the environmental protection and sustainable development instrument, but nothing has happened so far, even though the amendment Law is in the procedure, and it doesn't recognize the green procurement.  
 - Number of strategic documents that Bosnia and Herzegovina signed with the EU (Danube region strategy, EU Strategy for Adriatic region) calls for the implementation of green public procurement.
- European Commission adopted a comprehensive Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans envisaging up to €9 billion of EU funding for key investments including accelerating the green transition.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Accelerator Lab has conceptualized an initiative that aims to pilot the use of clear, verifiable and justifiable environmental award criteria for public procurement of goods and services, based on a life-cycle approach and the EU standards, and fully in line with the current provisions of the Public Procurement Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina with one institutional partner which has a strong procurement need. We would support several procurement processes to test the benefits - both environmental and financial (potential savings for public authorities when the full life-cycle costs of a contract and not just the purchase price are considered).



Following the procurement processes supported, we would create a knowledge artefact - a short analysis of the effects of conducting a green public procurement, including the environmental and financial aspects, by comparing the results of procurement procedures before and after applying the environmental criteria for the same goods and services. We would also compare the results with the estimated environmental and financial effects of the procurement of the same goods and services if all available tools from the EU standards for green public procurement are transposed to the country legislation.  



The experience in the process would help identify strategic gaps and opportunities (legal, administrative, policy, capabilities, etc.), possible partnerships, and priorities that UNDP can support towards advancing the green procurement in the public sector, including the potential scope of priority work in transposing the EU green public procurement legislation and standards to the country policies and legislation.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Public authorities are major consumers. By using their purchasing power to choose environmentally friendly goods and service they can make an important contribution to the green agenda. AccLab BiH pilot aims to discover a roadmap for a strategic green public procurement uptake.  
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

Office for Common Affairs of State institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (conducting the pilot procedures)
Public Procurement Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina (informing about the comparative analysis to be produced and discuss the opportunities for the wider systemic uptake of green public procurement)
Regional ministries in charge of the environment (opening the floor for a conversation on the capacities building to support the greening of the procurement processes for procurement of the specific products, services and works)

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

We aim to develop a set of recommendations for the inclusion of green public procurement criteria in the public procurement procedures by the Office of Common Affairs of institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that would present the Office with:
- Overview of products, services and works’ groups currently procured by the Office that are suitable for greening (i.e., including the green procurement criteria in the follow-up procurement processes);
- Recommendation on the inclusion of green criteria per product group (without having the ambition to be complete or completely detailed), with reference to sources such as web sites, ecolabel schemes (national and EU) and available tender documents that represent good practice (national or EU);
- Recommendation on alternative approaches to greening the procurement, where feasible, in combination with the use of green criteria and specifications of products/services/works, so that Office can reflect their green ambition in their procurement process (e.g., the need for procurement of paper can be diminished by different management measures such as the maximising the use of electronic documents, or procuring and installing multifunctional devices or printers with duplex printing function, etc.);
- Guidance on what can or should be done at each procurement stage when it comes to including environmental criteria, including the contract drafting stage.


In the follow-up activity, we would support the design of standard tender documentation with selection criteria, product/service/work specifications, award criteria and contract clauses, each with appropriate green aspects/information in at least three (3) emergent procurement procedures of the Office.


The goal of this activity is to demonstrate the green public procurement and to make it clear that it can be implemented to the extent which is in line with the provisions of the Public Procurement Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 


The results of those procedures would inform a short analysis of the effects of conducting a green public procurement, including the environmental and financial aspects, by comparing the results of procurement procedures before and after applying the environmental criteria for the procurement of the same products and services.
