Redesigning public policy making through the development of a National Development Strategy [NDS] in North Macedonia. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

To change the way National Strategic Documents are designed, implemented, and monitored by applying system transformation methodology and using the Doughnut model in supporting the Government to develop a National Development Strategy. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Governance is an overarching theme pivotal to the development of the state particularly as we are at a turning point when we are discussing North Macedonia’s future socio-economic and human development. The next decades as a society we will face challenges such as climate change, environmental, socio-economic issues as well as resilience and recovery to global threats like the Covid19 pandemic. In parallel to this, the recovery from the pandemic will require new models and mechanisms of future planning that need to be reflected in the way our country develops its policy planning documents, particularly in the realm of development. To contextualize things further, the prolonged EU integration of the country combined with the ongoing implications of the pandemic, urge the country to build a nation-wide shared development vision that would be built on principles that will enable our institutions and system to tackle future challenges.  Our Accelerator Lab has the challenge of ‘Good Governance’ as one of the frontier challenges for this year, with a particular focus on enhancing the accountability, transparency, quality, and inclusiveness of our public institutions. The public perception in our institutions and the trust in them is an inseparable component to the described challenge, which we are tackling as well. Consequently, we aim to address the frontier challenge of ‘good governance’ through part-taking in the UNDP-led initiative to develop the first / new National Development Strategy [NDS] of the country. However, we wanted to focus on investigating if it is possible to change the way we are designing, developing, implementing, and monitoring our strategic documents through experimenting with the process and the design of the methodology for the proposed NDS. Our idea is to build a nation – wide inclusive process, where the document will have national ownership, be built on the most contemporary methods in the development world, include unusual partners from the design stages of the process, and combine the expertise of international and national experts to inform the methodology of the Strategy. What is particularly relevant for us is to inspect the shortcomings of existing strategic documents, and initiate something new, something that would result in this Strategy being more than ‘just another document’ that citizens know nothing about and feel little attachment to it.  In the first 100 days our Accelerator Lab quickly learned, through mapping the existing national strategies that: a lot of them expire in 2020, and that will inevitably leave a strategic policy gap, that will need to be filled. We also noted through that mapping exercise that existing strategies were all built within one institution [one ministry or government entity]. We also learned something that has been reported in EU reports but also other investigations from CSOs – which is the lack of coordination and communication among institutions in the development and implementation of documents like these, but also, the evident lack of communication from public institutions on the goals and progress of the activities in these strategies with the public. For us this one crucial driver of the described challenge of public trust in our institutions as well as the perception of transparency and accountability of our system. So, we decided to join forces with everyone in our office that worked on the development of the strategy, become a part of the operational team for this initiative, and make these ideas the reality.

For our frontier challenge of ‘good governance’ there are many data sources that support the need for interventions in the realm. For instance, North Macedonia has been ranked as a ‘partly free country’ by Freedom House in 2020 [link here] and ranks 111th on the Transparency International Index of Corruption [link here] raking on the lowest position in the country’s history. Moreover, a recent study by the National Democratic Institute showed that the level of public trust in our public institution, suggesting a lack of confidence in the political and governing leadership in the country [link here]. The situation is even more complex now with the pandemic and the socio-economic impact it has on the country.  This only highlights the added urgency for a change in the approach our public policies are developed, implemented and monitored. If we want the system to create long term policies that will tackle the challenges in unemployment, environment, social affairs etc. we need the public to trust the process, be part of the process, be able to learn about the progress of the implementation of those policies and its implementation.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

For the first 100 days our Accelerator Lab was looking at weak signals that will inform our activities for the support of the National Development Strategy. We already mentioned what we learned from our desktop mapping exercise, that informed us about the shortcomings in the design, implementation and monitoring of existing strategies. To build on that, on every interview that we had with CSOs, members from academia and think tanks on the topic of existing strategic documents and their implementation, they all referred to the lack of publicly available information pertaining to the implementation status of the strategies and plans as an obstacle for citizens engagement. This identified issue was even more enhanced now as digitization is seen as a step forward in public policy making by citizens. What took us by surprise in our first 100 days was just how much different stakeholders were supportive of a new model for designing our strategic public documents. The Government recognized that these processes have been siloed, not always inclusive and innovative – and was willing to make a change. They are even open to experiment with the latest approaches in the development world for the purpose of creating the methodology of the strategy. Local think tanks and CSOs were willing to take part in the process since its inception, participating in the design phase of the strategy, just to consider what can be done differently. In our first 100 days we learned that even though existing strategies were great in number, it seemed that they existed separately from each other, rarely referring or building on each other's goals and activities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Accelerator Lab team has been given the opportunity to take part in this process of redesigning our public policymaking through the NDS, but unlike everyone else involved in this massive endeavor [UNDP, other UN agencies, CSOs, Government counterparts etc.], we are given the green light to: try out new out of the box solutions to the challenges we have sensed; include and test models and innovations that have been tried in other countries; and offer a fresh new perspective on the process that has become customary for the stakeholders involved.  The Accelerator Lab has initiated ‘High Level Policy Dialogues’ in areas adjacent to our frontier challenges [and the three-learning action plans we have developed]. These Policy Dialogues were initiated with our Launch Event dedicated to the topic of ‘system transformation’, with emphasis on transformative policies in the area of businesses and startups, digitalization of public services and institutions, as well as green growth. We now aim to continue the conversation we initiated with the Launch event and proceed with organizing follow up events. For these events we aim to continue inviting international champions in the selected areas to share their experiences and lessons learned to stakeholders [government representatives, business community, startups, CSOs, academia etc.]. We hope that with these events we will sensitize decision makers of the change we want to see; that it will motivate other actors to act; and it will highlight UNDP as an important factor in the process.   Internally, the Lab has created a ‘platform’ for gathering feedback, ideas and doing co-design with our fellow colleagues from the country office. Our platform is called ‘Fridays at the Lab’, it is regular 30 minute get together where everyone in the office is invited to join a pre-determined discussion that enables cross-portfolio work, and debate. This imitative is something that we use to collaborate, but also to learn and gather intelligence from our CO. We aim to continue with this activity as an important segment of our action learning plan for the upcoming 100 days. ‘Fridays at the Lab’ topics cover all of our frontier challenges and the three action plans we have noted in this document. Our Team has also been instrumental in creating synergies between other UN agencies and UNDP in this process, working together with our colleagues from UNHCR to design the strategy in a manner that will ensure their core interests respected as well. In addition, our Accelerator Lab is uniquely positioned to coordinate our different portfolios on their insight for the development of the NDS, precisely because we are not attached to an existing portfolio. Finally, our Lab team of three has individuals carry experiences from three realms of work, so that is of particular use when designing this process, and ensuring to incorporate the perspectives of: the business, academic community, marginalized groups, etc. The inclusion of unusual partners in this process, and in the project component of development of the NDS has been instrumental to bring in new and fresh perspectives.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can we redesign the way we develop, implement and monitor our national strategic planning documents?   Supporting learning questions:  Can we incorporate and promote new models of development in our public discourse?   Can we create a system of partnerships and knowledge sharing and that would enable transformative practices and policies to take place? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use design thinking, and the system transformation approach to develop the methodology for the National Development Strategy. We will rely on a portfolio approach, as well as other innovation methods in order to design new implementation and monitoring strategies for our nation-wide strategic documents.  Through foresight we will try to anticipate what are the key themes the NDS should focus on, and what kind of an operational structure that would implement the NDS should look like being mindful of the upcoming challenges relevant for our country.  Through co-design between the UNDP, CSOs, the Government, Academia other UN agencies and other relevant stakeholders we will try to introduce new innovative development models that will inform our Strategy.  We will use visual thinking and mapping to showcase the novelties the NDS will offer to the public. From mapping the key stakeholders that should be involved in writing the strategy, to how the new communication platforms that will inform the public should look like, we will be using visual thinking and mapping to share the message most effectively.  We will use horizon scanning throughout the process so that we can deploy promptly solutions to ongoing challenges in the development of this document. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through citizen surveys we want to learn about the perceptions citizens have on the current processes regarding public policymaking, what can be improved, and how they see their engagement in it.   Through focus groups we want to learn about the attitudes of the people most impacted by the covid pandemic on what the NDS would mean to them, and what they want to see included.  Through constant direct interviews with various stakeholders in the process, we would like to learn about the things we can do better in the design phase of this process and include different perspectives and insights in the process. We will also use these interviews for foresight and anticipatory governance linking it back to the NDS process.   Socio-economic data [existing and new] will inform our advocacy for the need of long-term strategic plans that are built on new principles.   Through social media data, we would like to learn more about the reactions the public would have on process of developing the NDS.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

If we prove that public policymaking can be done in a different way than the dominant and prescribed doctrine, we can locate the champions in our country that made the change possible (giving us a map of early adopters and enablers in the ecosystem of public policymaking) and encourage this kind of methodology and process [one that is inclusive and with early engagement of different stakeholders] for the purposes of developing other strategic documents as well.
