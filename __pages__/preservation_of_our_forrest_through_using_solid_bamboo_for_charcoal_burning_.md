> Title of the innovation

Preservation of our Forrest through using Solid Bamboo for Charcoal Burning.

> Brief description of the innovation

Charcoal burners in our community in particular and Zambia at large have for a long time been cutting forrests, trees, indiscriminately for charcoal burning. Most of charcoal burners being illiterates, have little or no knowledge on the impacts of deforestation on the environment, like soil erosion and other effects of climate change. I have been permanently in my home/village community for over 6 years now watching in awe, how our Forrests are being brought down mainly for charcoal burning. I have since been inquiring on alternatives to this practice until I came about The Solid Bamboo. The Solid Bamboo charcoal is in fact the best charcoal, that it can be used for Timber and it's leaves for Organic Fertilizers. 
With this background, I decided to group people together targeting mostly charcoal burners families and formed "Tiwale Organic Farming Cooperative Society". We are based in the Eastern rural Zambia, in Chasefu / Lundazi District. Membership is at 64, 35 women among them 48 youths and 6 physically challenged.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Charcoal is the most used energy for cooking and heating in Zambia. With a 50kg bag currently going at more than ZMK100, and market readly available, charcoal business is very viable in Zambia.
The target market are the peri urban communities who have no access to fire wood and due to high cost of electricity energy and it's erratic supply really heavily on charcoal energy. Charcoal is always in short supply, since despite the persistent cutting of Forrests it's ilegal to do so. In our area charcoal business is mostly done undercover to avoid the government officials from the Forrestery department. As such, the proposed solid bamboo charcoal business will be very viable since it will be produced from cultivated solid bamboo.
Everyone member involved in the project will benefit through profit sharing upon commencement of charcoal production. This is sustainable because once the bamboo is grown off shoots keep growing hence the harvest. We project to sale 100 bags which will increase as our bamboo multiplays.
To the environment, this Solid Bamboo innovation will help fight the dangers of climate change through reduced deforestation and the use of Organic Fertilizers.

> Technical Feasibility

We shall need to sink a borehole, ZMK60,000, for watering the bamboo shoots during dry seasons. Bamboo shoots will be procured at ZMK300 each and we hope to start with 600 shoots giving a cost of ZMK180,000. In the first year, to keep our members from charcoal activities, each member will be assisted with 4 by 50kg bags of organic fertilizers and a 10kg Maize seed at ZMK650 giving a cost of ZMK39,000. This will keep our members off charcoal business for the interim 3 to 5 years as we cultivate our bamboo for harvesting. Members will be expected to sustain themselves in the interim with the first kick start of organic fertilizers. Cultivation of bamboo will be by community, members, free labour contributions. Incidentals are estimated at ZMK28,000.
The project cost total cost is preojected at ZMK309,000
The best time to sink a borehole is in October when waters are low and November the planting will be done.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This Bamboo Charcoal innovation will improve the lives of the surrounding communities through the resulting income. The Forrests will not be degraded as a result the community will have fertile soils and good rains in the long run. 
With the income generated, members will be able to have a healthy and well-being lives. 
Above all, once you start cultivation hence harvesting, bamboo is a continuous process.
