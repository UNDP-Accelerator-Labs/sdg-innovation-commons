The game is called "DAME" , strategic and High reflexion game. We enjoy  playing it in Africa. Most of time precisely during the holidays. Fine, if ti is to be played in the day time also in the night where light is. In general, once there is power outage, no more game and we have to wait untill it come back again. So to stay active during outages, here is a solution created by the team. It is supplyed in power by 2 to 4 LEDs that are working with 5V Battery.  so if you are projecting to travel and are not sure to find light were you are targetting to go please check "the Freedom fighter ¨Power bank" that can easily be used with this one to produce up to 5 years power stock for you.
