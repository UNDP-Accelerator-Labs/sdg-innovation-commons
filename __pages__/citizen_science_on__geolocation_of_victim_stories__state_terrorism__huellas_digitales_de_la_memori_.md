## Overall goal

Jointly reconstruct, make visible, and geolocate in the digital space the life stories of victims (people were disappeared and/or murdered) by State terrorism (1966-1983) in La Plata, Berisso, and Ensenada (Buenos Aires). 
## Specific goals

Jointly assemble a digital archive based on a database of victims of State terrorism and a repository of documents and images about the issue. 

Reconstruct the stories of missing persons through materials that incorporate aspects of their lives (work, studies, profession, cause they supported, repressive detention, legal situation, etc.). 
## Description of citizen participation

The work team is made up of people from different fields of work and with different roles and levels of participation and activism in human rights causes (historians, lawyers, anthropologists, archive workers, and students). For the reconstruction of the stories, the biographies are sent to the victims’ relatives so that they can verify the information; then, they are invited to add any other data, photographs, or text about their life stories. In addition, citizens can contact each other by e-mail, which gives them the opportunity to learn new stories and even get in contact with family members living abroad. While editing the stories, meetings are held with local human rights organizations and other bodies for validation.
