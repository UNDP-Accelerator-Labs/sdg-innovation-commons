Scaling Clothing for disadvantaged communities 

> How would you describe this solution in under 300 words? 

FabricAID collects, sorts, and redistributes clothes to disadvantaged communities at micro-prices (ranging from 0.3$ to a maximum of 2$). Our goal is to deliver good quality clothing into the hands of people who need them, while also reducing fabric waste.
