> Brief description of the innovation

To add value to farming in Zambia so that the economy stabilise for instance young farmers like me if we can be able to invest the little we have and gain double or triple by at least selling to other neighboring countries freely and locally. so am pleading with you my  goverment to open up ways of free farming lessons to us youths with the vision of farming and also bring up measures of exporting Zambian food products to our neighboring countries  a decent fee...the corruption at borders should stop now that change has come in Zambia.let's bring back value to Zambian farming🙏 so that us youths that are planning on taking farming serious in future shouldn't loss hope.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My target market is DRC border coz pipo in Congo don't really farm and local Zambian markets

> Technical Feasibility

Free farming lessons and government supplying farming matterials to the less privileged in farms

> Anticipated Social Impact

Adding value to farming will course alot of people to start up farming businesses,more farmers in Zambia equals to less prices of local food so therefore prices will normalise in due time and Zambia will never complain about the economy again coz vegetables and animals are been kept all around Zambia and farmers begin to live stable comfortable lives  whilst the Zambian pipo are getting Zambian food products at a normal stable price
