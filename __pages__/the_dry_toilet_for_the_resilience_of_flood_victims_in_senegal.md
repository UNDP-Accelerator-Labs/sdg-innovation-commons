## Summary

In times of flooding, people especially women are faced with a crucial problem: access to toilets. A start-up has designed the "dry toilet" which allows flood victims to preserve their dignity. The principle of the design is based on the elevation above the level of the house and the integration of a biodigester 
## Description

The Digester dry toilet consists of a digester, a superstructure, a hand-washing device, and layers of filters that treat the effluent generated by the system. The digester is the key component of the toilet, which breaks down the manure on-site through an aerobic process without adding any chemicals. After each visit to the toilet, the porous filter in the digester quickly separates the solid from the liquid part. The solid part (feces, toilet paper, etc.) is retained by the filter of the digester and degraded by micro-organisms (bacteria) and macro-organisms (e.g. earthworms) and then converted into rich soil improvers that can be used without danger for the soil. 

Nevertheless, this fertilizer can only be recovered after two to three years of the digester's operation, corresponding to its maintenance period. As for the liquid part, it seeps directly through the filtering belts of the digester to be drained into a sand filter for further treatment or into a sump. 

In addition, the excreta can be used as a Biofertilizer for farmers for better agricultural yields and/or used for the production of Biogas for households to fight against abusive deforestation in rural areas and urban areas the biogas can be used by restaurant owners.
