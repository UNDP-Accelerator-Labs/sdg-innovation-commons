> Title of the innovation

Hybrid solar/ethanol stove - Heliac solar cooker when the sun is shining with ethanol biofuel used in cloudy weather

> Brief description of the innovation

We have made an existing Fresnel solar stove which uses a plastic lens and foil mirror fixed to the steel frame and an adjustable system to direct the sunlight onto the cooking point. It focuses the sun’s rays and the beam of concentrated sunlight is reflected into the cooking area where the heat is used to cook meals. The system cooks food and boils water using direct sunlight (no electricity). 

We have abundant sunny days in Zambia, however with this system we can't cook at night or when the weather is not suitable. Our innovation will improve that system with the addition of biofuel ethanol plates. 

The hybrid solar/biofuel stove will continue to use free energy when the sun shines with the added benefit that it will work at any time. When the weather is cloudy we will be able to switch to biofuel (ethanol). 

The hybrid stove will have one plate using sunlight and two plates which use ethanol. This combination of two systems allows us to cook meals during the day or night or when the weather is not suitable for solar cooking.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The manufacturing price is K 1.250 and the sale price is K 2.500. The sale of one solar stove can allow us to make the next two stoves. 

The hybrid solar cooker is a valid product to the communities. Solar cookers are very simple and can almost always be made from inexpensive, locally available materials. We can cook every dish on the solar stove. The Hybrid solar stoves market is around 20 solar stoves per month and our target customers are farmers in rural area and population in urban area where they using charcoal for cooking. 

The hybrid solar cooker has many functions: Stove, food dryer, water pasteurization, mobile restaurant. 

For our customers the innovation will help families reduce up to 90% of their energy costs, allowing them to save money for other bills. They can also use it to generate income, create jobs and reduce poverty.

> Technical Feasibility

The hybrid solar stoves use renewable energy, the sun is absolutely free, and biofuel. It requires no electricity. 

We have made a prototype Fresnel solar cooker but have not yet made a hybrid version. However this adaptation is fairly simple as we have fully explored and understood the solar cooking design.

Our marketing strategy is for our customers to become ‘ solar cooking heroes’ - promoting our product through word-of-month.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1) Saving lives - In 2018 we gave three solar stoves to three families here in Lusaka. In the same period, the cholera epidemic was declared. By sterilizing water using the sun, the families were able to kill the cholera bacteria and protect themselves and neighbours from this deadly disease. One litre of water can be boiled in 15-20 minutes.

2) Saving money – Using the solar stove a family of eight people can halve their need for charcoal and save some money for other bills.

3) Reducing climate impacts - The use of each solar stove can save more than 3 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year by reducing the use of charcoal. Sunshine is free and generates no emissions.

4) Reducing deforestation – By shifting from charcoal to sunshine as a fuel source, we reduce one reason for deforestation.
