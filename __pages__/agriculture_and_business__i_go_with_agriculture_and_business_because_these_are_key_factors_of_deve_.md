> Title of the innovation

Agriculture and Business, I go with agriculture and business because these are key factors of development.i start with agriculture has a lot products that it produces, and few to to be mentioned soyabeans, maize groundnuts and many more. Zambia grows maize but the melie meal is very expressive as if as we are importing maize from another country. We grow tomato too but we are buying tomato paste from South Africa, why can't we have the machines for making tomato paste? So invest more in agriculture, give loads for fertilizer at a low cost of Interest. Business  is the factor that can help us, and take us to zero poverty in our country because it's carrying a lot of things with a lot of money. Give loans to marketeers at a low cost interest so that person shouldn't be a difoter.

> Brief description of the innovation

Giving loans to business men and women at low cost of an interest, for example 5-10% why doing that? So that person shouldn't be a difoter, and to create a chance for some other to get that loan as well. Like agriculture, I can also talk about aquaculture keeping fish🎏 teach people how to keep fish at the pond and empower them. Same applies to potery farming, livestock and so own.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income to me by selling some goods, for example if you give a loan one the government will benefit because of the 5-10% interest, two how others will benefit from my innovation, if I start business of course that business will be going growing and it won't be the single handed thing no, it will need me to have some people who will be able to help me for that business to progress. I will employ my fellow youths, that's how others benefit from my innovation. And how it will  help others businesses going forward or improve, I will have some works and those works will need to  be eating, and I will be buying food from the surrounding restaurants, and the restaurants will keep on operating. My target market is city market. My value addition to the environment, one paying taxes and helping people who are in need.

> Technical Feasibility

My proposal is give loans to people in many different ways, in business and agriculture sector. Teach people how to handle there businesses, how to save money, how to keep fish, how to keep  chickens🐔 and many. Any invest more in agriculture business ideas.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will make others improve their lives into so many ways, a person who keeps fish will never ever buy that same type of the that he or she is keeping, same applies to chickens and so own.
