An online platform where youth can earn by doing good deeds and micro jobs in their   communities and enables them to access goods and services from a variety of  local vendors such as hairdressers, barbers, medical doctors, as well as national retail partners. RLabs, through its implementation of Zlto, will directly impact more than 1 million youth over 5 years by providing access to opportunities to do micro tasks and good deeds in the local communities.
