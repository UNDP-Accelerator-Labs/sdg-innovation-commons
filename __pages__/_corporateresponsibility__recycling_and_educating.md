## 

Companies that work with CMI already seek to generate less waste and adopt raw materials from non-virgin sources and recycled material; they also offer biodegradable products that fulfill their purpose and degrade more easily. Another aspect to which the companies are adding is that they are helping to raise awareness in the communities surrounding their companies about the positive impact of recycling on the environment and water resources, one of the main sources of contamination due to the inadequate management of waste and solid waste.
