## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Enhancing sustainability, innovation, and impact in urban development by

supporting a state-owned government corporation in its five-year strategic

planning.
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to balance urban expansion with sustainable resource management while ensuring financial stability, efficiency,and strong governance. Through UNDP’s support for HDC in their strategic planning, we are providing actionable insights into development to create resilient, future-ready cities in the Maldives by 2030.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Housing Development Corporation (HDC) significantly influences the urban environment of the Maldives, aiming to transform quality living through sustainable urban development. HDC oversees the creation of Hulhumalé, the country's largest residential city, designed to house two-thirds of the population. In addition, HDC is developing an industrial island for waste management, a tourism commercial island, and extensive reclamation projects for new artificial

cities. The Maldives contends with issues like limited land availability and concentrated urban population. As HDC broadens its urban development efforts, it needs a strategic approach to resource management. The strategic plan for

2025-2030 focuses on improving financial stability, operational efficiency, governance, and long-term sustainability while

responding to socio-economic and environmental shifts. This strategic planning, driven by UNDP and HDC, is informed by the 2023 Hulhumalé Liveability Index study, using its pillars and scores as the framework for the strategic plan.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Maldives Accelerator Lab has been leading this partnership with HDC for over two years, and the SAP initiative emerged as an extension of the existing co-financing agreement established with HDC, resulting in Acclab colleagues leading the engagement from CO. In 2023, this collaboration developed the country’s first City Liveability Index for Hulhumale, now featured on a dashboard on the HDC website. The current SAP work has mainly been directed and informed by the scores of the Liveability Index. Furthermore, the current landscape assessment of the SAP has focused on digital and innovative solutions, another key area of interest for the Maldives Acclab in 2025. There is significant potential to leverage smart cities and data-driven decision-making to enhance our co-financing partnership further and attract other donors.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we use digital and data-driven insights for better decision-making in urban planning?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Data-Driven Urban Planning (GIS &amp; Liveability Index Analytics): This would help us analyze spatial data, land use, and population density to guide urban expansion by utilizing tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Hulhumalé Liveability Index, Big Data Analytics.

Smart City Technologies &amp; IoT (Internet of Things): To improve efficiency in urban infrastructure, transportation, and resource management by utilizing tools such as smart sensors, AI-driven traffic management, real-time air monitoring.

Systems Thinking &amp; Scenario Planning: This will help us anticipate socio-economic and environmental shifts for long-term resilience. Tools to be used include Futures modeling, policy simulation software, risk assessment frameworks.

Public-Private Partnerships &amp; Co-Creation with Stakeholders: To ensure inclusive urban development by engaging communities, businesses, and policymakers by engaging communities in participatory urban design workshops, stakeholder engagement platforms.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We can aim to unify financial, asset management, and service operations data with the new data sources. Citizen engagement can also beleveraged to collect feedback and satisfaction metrics. With ESG

(Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics, new sustainability indicators may be incorporated into project assessments and governance reviews. Market

intelligence and risk data can be utilised to gather analytics for financial

sustainability, economic diversification, and infrastructure investment opportunities.
