## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To guage the uptake of upcycling activity after exposure to our reverse shop.


> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If gamification and economification are utilized; upcycling will increase.


> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Design of Posters, Guided Tours of Facility, Information Pamphlets

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The hidden value in upcycling waste and how to properly engage all age groups to engage in upcycling activities.


> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

UNDP Internal Processes slowed down many processes.


> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Anyone working in waste management.


> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Local Community, Schools, Garden Association, Waste Collection Workers.


> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes as it involved technical design of many machines which underwent 3 major changes.


> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Anything requiring design will not be completed in 100 days.


> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes as it presents an interesting approach to testing features within multiple experiments to isolate the design feature from the larger experiment using system thinking.


> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

.

> What surprised you?

The amount of waste that can be upcycled but was not because it was perceived that it did not have value.
