The solution aims to establish a small office on the basis of the neighborhood, to identify the women working in domestic services in that neighborhood and to communicate with them to exchange information about their working conditions, rights and responsibilities, and to meet this process face-to-face by a female expert to undertake regular work follow-ups, employee-employer satisfaction surveys.
