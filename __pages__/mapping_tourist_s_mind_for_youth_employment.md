## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

LQ1: To know about the tourist mind;

LQ2: To understand the satisfaction level of tourists overall and in a particular area;

LQ3: Generate tourists' data to support to the service design, policy making and employment generation;

LQ4: To generate effective visualization and analysis for service providers and policy makers;

LQ5: To understand the patterns of the customers;

LQ6: To understand the level of satisfaction and collect feedback on particular services and locations;

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF the tourists' information available to the service designer and service providers THEN design and patterns of the services are more appropriate to the tourists;

H2: IF the reasons behind the satisfaction of the tourists are known THEN it is easier to define and determine the responsibilities of stakeholders;

H3: IF the information of the tourists visualized and analysed appropriately THEN policy makers can take right decisions.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Non-monetary resources from UNDP projects: 1. Time allocation from teams; 2. Stakeholder Identification and target group identification; 3. Allocating venue from Local Government and Ministry of CHT; 4. Equipment support from private and public sectors; 5. Technical support and consultation from different stakeholders; 6. Advisory support from Bangladesh Tourism Board and Bangladesh Tourist Police; 7. Technical support from University of Dhaka.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

yes

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology used for the research brought out the important aspects which often the service providers miss out. This methodology involved all the stakeholders and conducted 360-degree analysis to identify the Ares where service providers need information. Only thing that we may change is the length of the questionnaires. Often the tourists shows unwillingness to give much time to capture their opinion as it disrupts their fun activities.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

10 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

5,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, this activity has a next stage. As a next step, a dissemination session involving all the service providers shall be organised to inform them where they need to work to meet the demand of the tourists. Moreover, they should also be encouraged to developed digitised platform to capture tourists' data, tourists' opinion that they can use for designing new offers, and services to satisfy tourists and encourage them for revisit to the place.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, this experience is planned to be scaled up in the islands of Bangladesh to design tourist friendly services.

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1. It was not realized before that mapping tourists mind is important; 2. The main learnings during this experiment are: the service providers were never ready to invest to know what tourist wants rather to offer what they have; the tourists have no proper channel to get information about services at different tourist places.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Tourists were not ready to give enough time for the survey as it disrupts their vacation time and activities. Rather they are interested giving opinion at their convenience on different online platforms.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

As this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit both the accelerator lab to design new experiments to satisfy different need of the tourists and other relevant projects who are working for developing services and human resources for the tourism sector.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Though this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit all the actors involved in the tourism sector including the tourists.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, this experiment requires a certain number of iterations. At the very beginning of the research, it was thought that the data will be collected from the public and private service providers to know what the tourists demand. But later it was realised that no one has any data regarding the need of the tourists rather everything they were suggesting were based on their assumptions. Realising that decision was taken to collect the data directly from the tourist. Therefore, the questionnaire firstly developed for the service providers were later revised for the tourists. Moreover, after development of the questionnaire the questionnaire became too large which would be annoying for the respondent tourists. In this context, the questionnaire was divided in to three sections and shorten.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Before initiating or replicating the experimental activity, they should analyse what tourist data are already available at hand. Understand can the available data predict the need of the tourists or shall they reach out to tourists directly. They should explore if there are platform where tourists can give their opinion and information digitally and willingly. Then they should design the study and conduct.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, Informality, Blue Tourism, Behavioural Insights, Youth Connection. SDG 1,2, 11,16.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The entire experiment dependent on the guidance of the government officials and private stakeholders. Therefore, it was highly influenced by the need of the policy makers and service providers.

> What surprised you?

Surprisingly, all the relevant stakeholders welcomed the experiment wholeheartedly and showed their keen interest to further working with the Accelerator Lab on this experiment.
