With cashews being the biggest export of the country and employing a disproportionate number of population, there has been interest in ways to make the job easier. Ricardo Ca, developed this machine which functions with no electricity, in direct response to the lack of constant electricity in the country, which peels cashew nuts. This is to elevate the harm caused by peeling manually and increase the number peeled per minute.
