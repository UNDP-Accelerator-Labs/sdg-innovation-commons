Mrs. Kaur farms sugarcane in a rural part of Western Fiji. She also raises pigs. Although she is assumed to be in need of “empowerment”, she already maximizes productivity even with lean resources by using a drone to inspect her farm acreage. She also monitors her piggery with CCTV cameras, thereby decreasing incidences of theft. These twin challenges – theft of animals and supervision of a large plot of land -- have served as barriers to other women thriving in the sugarcane farming business.
