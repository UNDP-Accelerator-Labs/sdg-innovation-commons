## Description

What is the Challenge?

Eco-Bloc Technologies Limited addresses the issue of non-recyclable solid waste, particularly plastics (such as single-use plastic, wrappers, sachets, and multi-layer plastic) and fabric waste. These materials are commonly used daily but often end up in landfills, agricultural lands, rivers, and oceans due to their non-recyclable nature. Traditional mechanical recycling methods for plastic and fabric have limitations, including restricted use applications, unpleasant odors, unreliable performance, and limited color options.

What is the Solution?

EcoBloc Technologies Limited has developed a solution to transform plastics and fabric wastes into versatile, high-value products like blocks, tiles, partition boards, and sanitary rings. This is achieved through a unique purification process and innovative technologies. EcoBloc's approach is to treat plastic and fabric as renewable resources that can be utilized multiple times.

EcoBloc's patented process uniquely recycles non-recyclable plastic and fabric wastes by separating color, odor, and other contaminants. This method transforms these materials into high-value, saltwater and fire-proof, and climate-resilient building materials. This process contributes to closing the loop on plastic and fabric waste, making recycled materials more accessible and feasible at a larger scale. EcoBloc is not only recycling these materials but also reviving them into new forms, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability.

Features of EcoBloc:

- Made from non-recyclable materials such as single-use plastics, wrappers, melamine, and fabric waste.

- Utilizes cutting-edge technology with a pending patent application.

- Exhibits twice the strength compared to traditional clay blocks. PSI 2755.

- Poses no health hazards for users.

- Applicable for constructing houses, fencing walls, and latrines.

- Eliminates the need for cement, thus contributing to the reduction of the cement industry’s carbon dioxide emissions (which account for 7% of the world’s total).

- Features pre-assembled components for easy installation by anyone.

- Requires nuts, bolts, and a foundation for reinforcement. Operates as a 100% clean technology with a solar-based manufacturing process.

- Waterproof, Heatproof, and Fireproof. Can stand 3 hours against fire.

- Size: 12”/6”/5”
