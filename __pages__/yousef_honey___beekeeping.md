## Solution holder: Yousef Al Sayyah

Different flowers grow and boom in different seasons and based on that, there are three honey flavors in the three honey harvests of a year.

Yousef, the beekeeper, will guide you through a beekeeping journey that will end in his workshop. There you will be able to extract honey from honeycombs. This experience is a complete demonstration of the honey production process.
