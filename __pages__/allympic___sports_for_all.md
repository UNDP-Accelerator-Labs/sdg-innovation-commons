## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Allympic - Sports for All
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

UNDP Thailand, Youth Co:Lab Thailand and Accelerator Lab Thailand believe that attitudinal barriers and discrimination on the ground of disability will be reduced if more people in society have an opportunity to understand and become friends with PWDs.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Disability-inclusive development can be achieved only when there is non-discrimination against, ensured accessibility for, and active participation of PWDs. In addition to the relatively lower economic status, PWDs in Thailand face challenges to fully participate in society and all development areas, which is further heightened by discriminatory social attitudes. The extent of inequalities experienced by PWDs is often the result of a lack of accessibility to physical and virtual environments, institutional and attitudinal barriers, exclusion, and unequal opportunities. UNDP Thailand, Youth Co:Lab Thailand and Accelerator Lab Thailand believe that attitudinal barriers and discrimination on the ground of disability will be reduced if more people in society have an opportunity to understand and become friends with PWDs. Friendship can develop naturally and spontaneously when two people share their interests and enjoy doing activities together. However, there are very limited inclusive and accessible activities that allow PWDs to fully participate together with their peers without disabilities. In this regard, Youth Co:Lab Thailand and Accelerator Lab Thailand will organize social innovation challenge on developing inclusive activities under the Youth Co:Lab programme entitled “Pals with Disabilities (PWDs)”.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP Thailand pays attention to the issue of people with disabilities. And we want to understand why some people care about it. The Accelerator Lab plays a role in helping questions and assumptions come up.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Friendship makes everyone understand each other better because you won't leave your friend behind. And sports are one of the best ways to make friends. Let's create and play sports that both people with and without disabilities can enjoy together.
