> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Mr. Merab Chirakadze 

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

Tbilisi, Georgia. Email: merabtchirakadze@gmail.com

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

No

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The purpose of the invention is to utilize the energy of the river using its natural flow. The system includes series-connected hydro turbines, a generator, and a transmission mechanism for moving from the row of hydro turbines to the generator. The shafts of the hydro turbine are flexible and connected to each other.
