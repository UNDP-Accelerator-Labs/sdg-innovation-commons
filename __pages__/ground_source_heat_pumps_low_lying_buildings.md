> Description of the solution

Low lying buildings stay cooler than tall skinny ones because the ground mantains a preety even temperature. Ground-source heat pumps essentially supercharge this process by facilitating depositing heat in the ground in summer and drawing heat from the ground in winter.

> Other Notes

Host house in Salt Lake City was designed by architects Kipp Edick and Joe Sadoski to be a net-zero building. It is mostly one-story and uses a ground-source heat pump as one of its measures for controlling temperatures during extremes of the Utah's summers and winters:
