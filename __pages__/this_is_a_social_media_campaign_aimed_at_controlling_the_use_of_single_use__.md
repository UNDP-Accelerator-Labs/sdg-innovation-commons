This is a Social media campaign aimed at controlling the use of single use plastic in Eswatini. It is done by UNDP in partnership with the Eswatini Environment Authority, the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs as well as the 5 major food franchises in Eswatini. The aim is to introduce a partial ban that allows for single use plastic bags at source while also facilitating for some behavioural change on the part of the public and retailers on the control of single use plastic bags. the campaign, called Phatsa Sakho nawe (bring your own shopping bag), is part of some solutions that are being experimented with to determine the most feasible in the control of plastic bags.
