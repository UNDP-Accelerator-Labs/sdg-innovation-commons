## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Collaborative mapping of Solidarity Economy as a prototype to economic and social recovery
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that current economic crisis has affected livelihoods of many families who find themselves in precarious and/or informal conditions, thus grassroots mechanisms to access material and immaterial resources need to be identified.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Poverty and preacrity has deepened with the current crisis. Besides having an impact on income, it affects people´´s self-esteem and social conditions, and family’s opportunities throughout their life cycle. If people are expected to come up with individual solutions to unemployment, it creates high competitiveness and a societal model based on merit, giving room to social Darwinist discourse and logic (survival of the fittest myth). In this sense, diving in the solidarity economy as an ecosystem that may offer social change and new ways of production and distribution of tasks and income, may bring new perspectives and insights to development. Collaborative mapping will be done to surface other economies that are being explores, invented and prototyped at a community level, that can bring opportunities to scale and experiment.

It is urgent to look for other entrepreneurial models that not only create monetary value but other values where people and the environment are put in the center. Although paid employment is important and can provide means of living to many, in today´s context it offers little stability, decent wages and sustainability, due to flexibilization of rules and regulations.  In the meanwhile, worker owned and managed entrepreneurships, seem to be an alternative that needs to be explored, as thanks to its local territorialization, collective organization and equity, seem to thrive. https://www.elmundo.es/promociones/native/2020/07/04ca/ Cooperatives and associations are not new in Ecuador, yet, this form of collective entrepreneurship is more resilient to crisis. Our hypothesis is that they are able to withstand economic crisis because they are people-centered and produce value other than monetary growth. https://www.coops4dev.coop/sites/default/files/2020-09/Informe%20de%20Mapeo%20Cooperativo%20Ecuador.pdf We will be exploring formal and informal cooperatives.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

By focusing on solidarity economy, Accelerator Lab will identify an ecosystem that exists but is disarticulated. Accelerator Lab wants to create listening mechanisms that enable conversations to begin, networking to occur, and ideally inter cooperation to happen. As AccLabs, we are fluid laboratories, without walls, open. This means that we do not do experiments behind closed doors to reach isolated discoveries, nor do we consider ourselves “the” experts on current problems. We understand that the production of knowledge is collective, for this, we want to promote tools that mobilize and facilitate processes of thought, reflection and collective action. We understand that collective intelligence is more than "the sum of the parts", or the specific call to participate in consultative workshops or "thons". When we speak of collective intelligence, we recognize the diverse voices and we are interested in hearing and amplifying the most silenced ones. To do this, we want to think with a common and simple language, create tools that allow us to collectively collect the imagination, aspirations, needs and solutions of diverse citizens and actors. We want to collectively draw on a canvas, a solidarity economy, thriving in the context of great social and health crisis, that we believe, has an unknown and little explored organizational capacity and practices of reciprocity and redistribution.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We want to collectively draw on a canvas, a solidarity economy, thriving in the context of great social and health crisis. An economy whose organizational capacity and practices of reciprocity and redistribution has been little explores but may offer a new sustainable economic model to today´s times.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

• How does the, so far invisible, ecosystem of solidarity economy look like?

• What patterns can we see from local, community based solutions to coooperative livelihoods?
• What are the profiles or personas for collective organization









> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

To map worker-owned entrepeneurships that may be informal or more invisible, crowdsourcing will be used. Once we convene a diverse group of actors, sensemaking will be done with them, designing other methods particpatory methods.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We want to map and convene worker´s associations from the informal economy as well, these data sources can help us access to them, given that they are not registered in official databases because they are required to comply with requisites. The open call brings in citizen data that are willing to make themselves visible and that identify themselves with solidarity economy practices. I

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

As for prototyping a community managed vending machine as part of Solidarity Economy big bet (smaller cycle):
• How does a community managed model of a vending machine look like?
• What added value does it bring?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

A vending machine will collective be designed and tested based on users and makers needs. It will be community managed by a network of seamstresses from the informal- solidarty economy, thus the community manage model is a participatory process adapted to their needs.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

A geolocalized map of solidarity economy cooperatives from the formal and informal economy can offer information to civil society organizations, workers themselves and the government (local and national) of sustainable and fair models. Results from dialogues can provide insights to policy design and piloting of worker-owned cooperatives as a mechanism to ecomomic recovery. At this point (August 2021), government (IEPS) is interested in the map.
