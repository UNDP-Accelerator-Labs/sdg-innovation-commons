UNDP's initiation of the Women Creative Lab (WCL) demonstrates its commitment to empowering women and fostering entrepreneurship in the creative industries. WCL is a woman oriented coworking space with a uniquely enabling and nurturing peer environment. The success of WCL in Osh  in 2022 has paved the way for expansion into the Batken and Jalal-Abad regions, providing rural women with training, skills, and opportunities to generate sustainable income. Currently, more than 200 Labs’ residents have access to tailored training and mentoring support programs as well as to seed funding sources to test or accelerate their business ideas in creative industries; while more than 600 are engaged into the network through joint initiatives and events. The Lab also proves to be an effective “tool” to combat destructive gender stereotypes and mainstream innovations toward gender equality with women performing the role of the agents of change.
