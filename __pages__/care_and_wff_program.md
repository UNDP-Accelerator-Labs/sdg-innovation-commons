Description: Community producers committed to reforest with native species in the areas previously dedicated to the planting of crops, in the middle and upper part of the basin, protect the forests located on municipal lands and promote the processes of natural regeneration. These conservation works will be carried out thanks to the payment of a fee from the municipality of Teculután.  

Interesting feature: The contribution of the municipality as a buyer of environmental services is quantified at approximately $ 150 thousand per year.
