> Description of the solution

Large upfront costs often deter clean energy use.  The Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) approach to solar energy removes the upfront price barrier by allowing end users to pay in affordable amounts over time. A company essentially rents consumers a solar home system. Basic systems have enough power to charge phones and lights, and larger ones can power small appliances like radios or TVs. PAYG schemes use smart meters installed in households to monitor energy use and enable consumers to pay in smaller increments on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis using mobile banking platforms. Through this model,  access to energy in off-grid areas is improved, companies can minimize the cost of collections by automating the receipt of payments and remote rural customers get immediate access to basic electricity without having to take out a loan.
