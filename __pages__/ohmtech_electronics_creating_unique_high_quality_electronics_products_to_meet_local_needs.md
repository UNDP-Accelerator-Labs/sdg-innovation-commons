## What is the challenge?

Around 2013-14, load shedding was a huge problem in Bangladesh. Hour-plus load shedding was not uncommon, which led to a huge demand for charger lights. While charger lights were not a rarity and you could find tons of charger lights in the market, both local and Chinese, finding quality charger lights was not easy. Most would not last long. While electricity is no longer a major challenge in most urban and semi-urban areas in Bangladesh, acute load shedding still is a challenge in many places, particularly in rural areas. Compared to that, while quality of charger lights have improved to some extent over time, most charger lights are generic in nature and don’t come with specific functionalities needed for various local needs such as long lasting, longer power supply, solar energy functionality, security features that can be used in farms in villages where charger lights have particular use, etc.
## What is the solution?

Wasiul Haque Bhuiyan studied telecommunication engineering at the University of Malay in Malaysia. After coming back to Bangladesh, he was looking for a job but couldn’t find anything meaningful. He started tinkering with some electronics products out of hobby and that's how he created his first product Magic Light and eventually ohmTech Electronics came into being.

“One day during load shedding, I couldn't find any working light although we had some 8 charger lights,” says Wasiul Haque Bhuiyan, founder of Ohmtech Electronics. “I tried all eight but none lasted long enough. Then I thought, let me try to make a charger light and see how it goes. Making a charger light is not a big deal, so I made one.” He then added a sensor to the light so that it lights up automatically when it is dark; that's how it became a magic light. Relatives and family members who saw it suggested marketing it. Wasiul took the idea seriously and started to turn it into a product. First commercial magic light was born. In those days, sensor-based charger lights that function automatically were not common in the market.

Today, OhmTech’s Magic Light is known as an automated charger light which automatically turns on in a dark environment and turns back off in a light environment without any human intervention. It's wireless and portable. You can place it anywhere below a light source and once fully charged, the lithium polymer variant runs continuously for 3 hours. It has a full charge indicator light and overcharge protection. In standby mode, it can last up-to 7 days. Despite its relatively small size, the light is bright enough to light a medium sized room. The light comes with a one year manufacturer warranty but these lights work perfectly for 2-3 years without any problem. With the quality it provides today, it doesn't have any comparable product in the market in the charger light category.

After the initial success of Magic Light, Wasiul started to get a lot of requests from people for various features. For instance, electricity is a challenge in many places where these products go. People use solar in many of these places. Many farm owners use these products and if a motion sensor and alarm is added, it can work as a security product. Many people want lasting back-up.

Based on all these different queries, in 2020, Ohmtech launched another product called Jumbo Light. The product comes with a ton of additional features. A high capacity lithium polymer battery and overcharge protection circuit with full charge indicator light. Motion sensor feature which means the light will automatically light on when you enter your room and then turn back off after you exit. Once fully charged, the battery provides power for up to 14 days (standby mode) and up to 12 hours if used continuously.

Jumbo light can also be used as a security device. Once installed near your windows or even your cattle farm, the alarm and the light will automatically turn on in the presence of anyone within 8-12 feets of this device.

The light also has a USB port, using which you can charge your mobile phone, power any USB fan/light or any kinds of USB gadgets. The light can also be charged via solar energy. A simple 10 Watts, 12 V solar panel can be used for charging Jumbo light. Jumbo Light can also be charged with any conventional mobile chargers.


Ohmtech mostly sells its products on social media and through online marketplaces such as Daraz and others. Ohmtech design and manufacture circuit and technology, assemble the main product and manufacture parts from different partners.

In the early years, most of its users were in Dhaka. However, that has changed eventually. Today, most of its users come from outside Dhaka. It has found a dedicated user group across villages in Bangladesh who need specific usage lights and like unique products. For instance, there are not any lights like Jambbo with so many features and such high quality.
