## Overall goal

Produce knowledge on the biodiversity of Mendoza drylands through a participatory approach with the citizens of urban and rural habitats to contribute to decision-making in matters related to conservation, education, management, and restoration. 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens participate in the recording and monitoring of species and environmental events through mobile applications and free and easily accessible online platforms, such as eBird, iNaturalist (ArgentiNat), and EcoRegistros. Participants share observations of animals, plants, and fungi, including macro and microorganisms. For each organism observed, at least three important pieces of information are recorded: species identification, date, and geographic location. For each record, photographs, sound recordings, and lists of species and drylands are submitted. By means of artificial intelligence, possible identifications are suggested by comparing submissions to the entries of the database. The scientific community, together with the naturalist community, identifies each record and monitor and corroborate the data. In addition, citizens propose problematic sites or sites lacking biological information and participate in the sampling and workshops with local authorities.
