> Title of the innovation

DAPOH TECH/FARMING INNOVATION

> Brief description of the innovation

1.It's an upcoming  technology innovation
2. With business  orientated ideas

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate incomes by the side business that it will have. Printing and typing service at the school where I am, of which am already doing will be bringing us enough cash for the innovation.
Also, trade type of business, where by we take goods to the villages i.e clothes, bicycle parts, etc then  exchange them with farming farmed product such as maize, beans, groundnut cassava among others that will be sold in urban areas and get a profit to sustain our innovation

> Technical Feasibility

Since I musey am a 3rd year Electromechanical Engineering study at the Copperbelt University, Mainly our innovation is bases on Electromechanical projects, we intend to amplify farming system in Zambia, hence coming up with machines that would make farming quicker and easier interns of labour.
Designing and Making of wind pumps and electric pumps using wind mills. On the second one, no need of tapping power from ZESCO nor placing solar plant in the farm but creating both Mechanical and Electrical energy from wind using thermodynamics and fluid Mechanics principles and knowledge. 
These will amplify farming even when it's not rain season

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will improve the lives of our community and the country at large. Zambia depends on mining for survival. So diversion has been the call for our economical development and for now we can only divert to farming.
Looking at our projects, when it's done, we will have enough farming product through out a year(seeing that we won't be waiting for rain in order to farm) and that will increase productivity and lessen the struggle of our people in community and Zambia at large
