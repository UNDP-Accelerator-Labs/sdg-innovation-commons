> Title of the innovation

The agricultural sector in piggery, poultry and crop farming,in improving youth social inclusion and economic opportunities in the agriculture sector.

> Brief description of the innovation

Palamambwe farm was inaugurated twenty two years ago in mutenda area along mutenda swamp in lufwanyama district.the main products are maize, groundnuts,beans and soya beans,we also produce chicken village and goats.the challenge we have is the selling of our products because of the swamp as most of the customers come from the other side of the swamp hence the products must be ferried from the farm to reach out customers coming from Chingola and muchishi area.this was causing sometimes our products like fresh maize to lose its test which falsed us to make sure we take our products to Chingola and that was adding some more expenses and causing our business to be very slow in selling. Our Main desire is to reduce an employment among the youths and the general public at large and promote the youth to be preoccupied with something duty so that they can not be busy to involve themselves in crime activities like theft,beer drinking, smoking and so many vices in the community.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The farm has been trying by all means to meet the dreams of customers but we have failed due to the following reasons.we have a very big farm with 100 hectors of land but we only utilize about ten hectors of land because of lacking machinery and man power,Due to this we only produce about five to eight tonnes of groundnuts.with your help,we can be able to produce more than we have been producing the passed twenty two years,and meet the demands of our people in our area and also the national at large.

> Technical Feasibility

Palamambwe farm plan to create a designated implementation team is responsible for ensuring successful implementation of the farm,create a shared vision among the team members,to ensure individual compliance,so that people don't feel like their voices went unheard,we will involve the people who will actually be implementing the change during planning phase, palamambwe farm will choose a strong team leader who will coach and educate team members along the way and seek out guidance from past implementation plan leaders to improve upon existing implementation processes within the organization.Create an Action-oriented plan then involve the correct people at the correct times also publicize the plan so successful implementation of palamambwe farm.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We are aiming at planting 10hectors of maize field,5hectors of groundnuts,5 hectors of soya beans,we aim at producing 10pigs per month this will require us having at least four different compactment where we can keep our pigs,this will improving the lives of others if we employee more works to work in the field and it will help our economy to grow and supply our needs so there be improvement.
