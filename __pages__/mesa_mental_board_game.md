> Brief description of the innovation

The MESA mental Board game is a teaching tool/ program that has within it .i.e 
    Poverty is a mindset problem and also a 
                    resultt of being greedy
1.the ability within it to view the embedded character of a being ,to expose the blind spot that is beyond intelligence but the heart " what is education when the heart is not educated" Aristotle 
Character is viewed through varies situation that happen during the program/game "for man knows not his reactions untill he is exposed to them" sun tzu . this exposure  allows us to know the type of being , being created as a result of leaning and the environment .upon detecting that ,then can we mentor them to be good leaders and not greedy one 
                Teaching Entrepreneurship
2. Entrepreneurship is not ,and can not be learnt passively but actively,meaning the ground must be layed that is going to allow
One to start from scratch ,make mistakes, 
think there own thoughts ,makee losses and build up a big company with the help of  other players ..for the game has money notes and companies one can invest in and make huge losses if not careful

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income generation
&gt; The MESA  program/game can be likened to Face book or Whatsapp tho more than that cause it's an entrepreneur and  self descovery social platform game that will be programmed into software hence to be downloaded by every individual of Evey class,race,age and religion
Apart from being downloaded, the physical board games will be sold to schools,across the continent, Universities, collage and families
                     How  it will  improve operations of existing businesses, 
   &gt; The 21st century entrepreneurs have seen a gap in the market which is Human resources,Human self descovery and human potential unleashing hence the result of having conferences, board mentorship etc and all operating business schools have realized that the need of something active is immediately needed i.e Universities,collage , secondary Schools aswel .this program will be used by the above as an active  tool 
 
  specify your target market/potential offtakers 
&gt; The program is divided into two parts the first being the software , an intervention that has no specific  market  meaning anyone being from as low as 12 to 100 years 
&gt; on the other hand ,The physical board 
game as a targeted market of school , collage and Universities
        Potential offtakers
Primary schools and secondary Schools
A tool that the ministries of education in various countries must impose in there education system as a subject

> Technical Feasibility

Design of the MESA board game/program
&gt;The MESA board game is designed in  a way that it as 12 cards ,among a few ,money cards , responsibility cards (that play with the minds ability to make the right decisions)
Hospital cards ( during the game ,families get sick and learn about the type of disease and it's treatment)  marriage ( the players get married hence more responsibility and money spending ) companies ( the program as a bank account that gives loans to be paid back within a period of time with interest . All this ,on an individual part view the character and also teaches Entrepreneurship

&gt; The prototype is already posted in the prototype sect i.e jpg file
               Implementation plan 
&gt; The fist step towards implementing the program is the intervention of schools ,which we started before the pandemic
 apart from that ,TV interviews and promotions by prominent entrepreneurs that I also personally know as a result of having meeting with and an extended network UNPD is going to provide 
 a one on on with all business schools and also with the ministries of education in various countries, starting with Zambia 
Having stands across all the malls in the country advertising and playing physical game to challenge the challengers to win within a specific period of time

> Anticipated Social Impact

The MESA  mental board game is the answer to the call of the 21st century problem, which is "mindset problem " poverty becomes real as a result of the mind and not the physical environment, 
What we have UNDP, is a tool that is going to open up the creative intuitive cognitive behavioral that will detect what we hold for the future as a result of what we become and not planly what the future holds for us 
It is the dream of the MESA mental board games,to have a young generation of entrepreneurs but this is only going to happen upon teaching the minds of the younger generation to see opportunities within the game which can further likened to real life ..
    The biggest market there is ,is human potential and the help to unleashing it

This market is will become the bigger industry and it's time we become the first to implement such a tool even before it grows to an exponential rate unrecognizable
This tool is the future oil and water of every conferences and company that will lubricant it's smooth running and operation. Almost Evey 2 months just in our country Zambia over 20 meeting and conferences are being held apart from that it's now evident that schools have become insufficient to meet the practical standard of human operational potential meaning school graduates have been unless when not employed but this tool will allow the mind to look way beyond a job and create one
