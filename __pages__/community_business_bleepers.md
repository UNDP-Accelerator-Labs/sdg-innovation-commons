> Brief description of the innovation

Community Busines Bleepers is a “Smart City Project” meant to help city dwellers get locations, directions and connect to businesses and other activities in a given community via smartphone by scanning the QR code or the Augmented Reality image displayed, using the AIRVIEWAR APP available on play store and appstore. For example, a bleeper in Kamwala will show businesses, parks, venues, etc in and around Kamwala area respectively.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Business bleepers serve the ideal purpose of providing users with a
business search platform in a given local community via a website - www.airpages.info. The website allows business owners to create their own accounts and showcase their businesses by uploading videos, company profiles, contacts, location maps, etc on a FREE or minimum subscription. 

Business bleepers will provide an alternative to printing and distributing flyers and posters that usually litter communities. Users will simply scan bleepers and access promos, coupons, news headlines, adverts, notifications, etc using the scan app AIRVIEWAR.
The bleepers will provide the City Council and other authorities with ( covet ) data on traders and other businesses for revenue generation and business identification, eg Pacra, ZRA, NAPSA...
Our target is both corporate and SMEs with the initial purpose to help them promote their businesses by providing an affordable yet interactive platform for extended visibility, in Zambia and beyond.

> Technical Feasibility

We have a complete working prototype with app available on app markets ( google play store and Appstore) AIRVIEWAR. 

The innovation is simply facilitating category or regional QR codes, that our backend office generates. First, we enlist businesses on our website in different categories. Then generate Dynamic QR codes pointing to them. The platform gives access to local services and products such as plumbing, mechanics, tailors, schools, shops, art studios, builders, car parks, sports academies, play parks, etc. when a user scans, a whole list of enlisted businesses is accessed on the user smartphone. Once in, the user then has an option to chose who he/ she likes to get a service from, by checking profiles, product images and videos, reviews, ratings, and so on. 

Our implementation plan is to roll out a few trial bleepers at some bus stations on major roads in Lusaka, as soon as Lusaka City Council and ZICTA approve our license application - already filed.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation is providing both users and the business industry with a digital platform meant to reduce the cost of advertising especially for SMEs, ease the burden of finding a local service or product and improve trade.
