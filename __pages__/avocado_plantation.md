> Title of the innovation

Avocado Plantation

> Brief description of the innovation

Since May 2021, I have collected 24 avocado seeds which I have planted 8 of which have germinated so far. I don't have land on were to plate them so the aim is to sell them once they mature for plantation whilst I continue with the collection and plantation of the avocado seeds. I'm hopeful that in the long run I'll be able to secure land where I will plant my own avocado plates.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My aim is to supply the avocado fruits to the Zambian markets which is on high demand. Avocado is a highly demanded fruit though it's in short supply so I  intend caution the demand by being the commercial supply of avocado in the long run.

> Technical Feasibility

My aim is to plant 1,000 avocado plant in the next 5 years which will be done in phases once land is acquired. I intend to broaden my knowledge on how to graft avocado plants so that I can secure early maturing avocado plants that can produce fruits after 3 years of plantation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Avocado plantation will create employment for the local people as the plants will require caretakers before they mature in tress and also ensuring that they are healthy. Avocados are in short supply on the Zambian market so this project will caution the demand.
