This will  be the bleeding and also hatching different types of chicken breeds

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will generate income because people will be buying different chicken breeds at a low cost and at the same place and also bringing there eggs for incubation at a fee as well. Value is added because the chickens being supplied will be improved breeds thus making the demand high.
