> Innovation Solution Description

Drone monitoring to optimize agricultural produce.

> Qualitative Results of the Innovation Solution 

1. Increased crop yields: Technoserve reports that farmers who have adopted improved farming practices have seen significant increases in crop yields. For example, farmers growing maize have seen yield increases of up to 100%, while those growing beans have seen yield increases of up to 70%.

2. Increased incomes: By increasing crop yields, Technoserve has helped farmers increase their incomes. Farmers who have adopted improved farming practices have reported income increases of up to 80%.

3. Improved access to markets: Technoserve has also worked to help farmers connect with buyers and access markets for their crops. By facilitating linkages between farmers and buyers, Technoserve has helped farmers earn higher prices for their crops and access new markets.

4. Increased adoption of technology: Technoserve has promoted the use of technology in agriculture, such as mobile apps for accessing market information and weather forecasts. By helping farmers adopt new technologies, Technoserve has enabled them to make better decisions and improve their farming practices

> Quantitative Result of the Innovation

1. Increased farmer income: TechnoServe works with farmers to improve their productivity, access to markets, and income. For example, in Ethiopia, TechnoServe worked with coffee farmers to improve the quality of their coffee and access international markets. This led to a 35% increase in coffee prices and a 50% increase in farmer income (source: TechnoServe Annual Report 2019).


2. Improved access to finance: TechnoServe provides technical assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the agriculture sector to improve their business operations and access to finance. For example, in Tanzania, TechnoServe worked with an agribusiness to develop a business plan and access financing. As a result, the agribusiness was able to increase its production of cassava by 50% and its revenue by 40% (source: TechnoServe Impact Report 2018).


3. Increased agricultural productivity: TechnoServe provides training and technical assistance to farmers to improve their agricultural practices and increase their productivity. For example, in Kenya, TechnoServe worked with dairy farmers to improve their feeding and breeding practices, leading to a 30% increase in milk production (source: TechnoServe Impact Report 2018).


4. Job creation: Techno Serve's work in agriculture innovation has led to the creation of jobs in the sector. For example, in Uganda, TechnoServe worked with an agribusiness to develop a business plan and access financing. This led to the creation of 55 new jobs in the agribusiness (source: TechnoServe Annual Report 2019).


5. Improved food security: TechnoServe's work in agriculture innovation has contributed to improved food security in East Africa. For example, in Ethiopia, TechnoServe worked with farmers to improve their productivity and access to markets. This led to an increase in food production and a decrease in food insecurity in the region (source: TechnoServe Annual Report 2019).
