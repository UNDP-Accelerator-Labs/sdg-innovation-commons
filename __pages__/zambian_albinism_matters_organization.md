> Title of the innovation

Zambian Albinism Matters Organization

> Brief description of the innovation

My dream and wish is to see children with albinism  in schools and getting access to quality education.50% of children with albinism in Zambia do not go to school both in rural and urban setup , this is as a result to so many barriers and challenges faced including discrimination, finances and health conditions that are sometimes beyond their control like low vision which every child with albinism is born with.The Organization started a reading clinic library two years ago to help these children with academics, skills and literacy,this library teaches and trains these children different skills like coding,writing,reading and other interpersonal skills that can help them develop self esteem and how to interact with others because these children mostly grow up timid and insecure in society.The children also receive school essentials and necessities that help them at school like spectacles as I mentioned about sight, uniforms and other protective clothes to protect their skin from sun burns and cancer.Most importantly our children also receive free sunscreens that help them from the direct sun as their families can not to afford these creams due to the high rate of price.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target are the children with albinism and our focus is in all provinces in the country.our aim is to focus  on reaching out to as many families with children living with albinism especially those in the rural areas and so far we have over 250   Children with albinism from all over the country  in many communities and provinces, we also  have over 200  parents and guardians who are living with these children, most children are abandoned and so they are forced to live with relatives of which in most cases they are mistreated,we involve both the parents and the children in different activities and projects under the organization to learn and interact together.We are working with  different organizations  and the communities including schools and churches  at large because the discrimination mostly happens and starts from there due to luck of sensitization,advocacy and educative programs and so we involve everyone to keep creating awareness and strengthening the voice of albinism in breaking the silence.The prize will help us buy school essentials for the children and buy a sewing machine for us to start our sewing classes with the mothers to find some start up money to buy more machines and help them make more money to help feed their families.

> Technical Feasibility

We plan to use our system by partnering with more schools,clinics and churches in helping us reach out ,sensitize to families in the different communities in the country to help us have children with albinism and families to be registered and recorded.Once these families visit the church or clinic they are recorded and handed to us to be added under our system.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovative will help to not only improve but touch and reach  out to many more families and children with albinism to be taken back to school and making sure they access good and quality education.This is relevant in the send that these children will be able to be educated and less discriminated in society.
