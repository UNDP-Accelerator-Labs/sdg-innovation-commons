A tourist community through which we seek to encourage domestic tourism in Jordan and empower the local community. We go on different tracks that include all parts of the Kingdom, north, south, east and west. Our paths are available to everyone and are diverse, as they include: community tourism, eco-tourism, cultural tourism, as well as accessible tourism - tourism for people with disabilities - it is our right to see Jordan through the eyes of a path and be able to know the identity of the land. The land always has a story that expresses who lives and passes through it. Our story is told by the souls of its participants. In each path, we exchange new experiences from everyone who joins us and the Masar family, and our story is completed by getting to know the people of the areas we visit, which are forgotten or unknown places to discover hidden stories. A path that includes: a walk in a new place, a new attachment to the customs and traditions of the inhabitants of the regions, a more adherence to the homeland. We climb the mountains through the valleys to see the magic of nature and the beauty of spring in the north of the country. We contemplate the stars of the sky and walk on the sand in the desert. We venture and defy the obstacles in the water valleys in the Jordan Valley. Each of us has a different vision and a different spirit, we hope with a path to spread and share a comprehensive vision of the concept of tourism and land
