Project LightUpTogether aims to spread Ecovation's innovations & technologies around the country. Ecovation partners up with nonprofit voluntary organizations, university clubs & other community service entities to implement their initiatives locally. They train the organizations on making solar lamps & streetlights out of easily available materials, then they  raise funds locally and light up their own locality by volunteer-made lights. Ecovation shares tutorials of their innovations online so that anyone can adopt the technology and light up communities.
