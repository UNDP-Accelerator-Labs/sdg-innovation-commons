> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Mr. Levan Imnaishvili

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

Tbilisi, Georgia.
Email: limn54@gmail.com


> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Yes. He is the Professor at Georgian Technical University (GTU)

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

It is crucial for the user to understand the dynamics of electricity consumption in order to use it as efficiently as possible. It is also important to know the tariff zone the user is in with the total consumption of electricity. In case of introduction of hourly tariffs, it will be important for the user to know in which time zone he is at a particular moment. 
The goal of our invention is to develop a digital system that will enable a single-phase network user to: 
control electricity consumption in the specified time slot
use an integrated expert system to determine what actions need to be done for optimization
Adjust the expert system priorities depending on the user’s needs

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

USD 20-100

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

TRL 7

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

N/A

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback
N/A

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Energy saving is a side effect for the proposed system. Its main purpose is optimal consumption of electricity and as a result reduction of electricity costs. We expect that the system will enable users to save around 20-30% on their electricity bill.



> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

The authors of the proposed system have been working on these technologies for years, have many inventions and realized systems. They use a similar system in the educational process, where students observe the indicators of electricity consumption: power, energy, voltage, current, etc. In the drawing, therefore, the implementation of the proposed invention is entirely within the authors' hands
