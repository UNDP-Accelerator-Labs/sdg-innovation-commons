Guinea, a country located on the west coast of Africa is endowed with a high rainfall, and has a vast network of rivers which earned it the name of water tower of Africa. A wealth taken advantage of by the government by the construction of certain dams for the provision of drinking water and electricity to the populations. However, the obsolescence of the circuits used to transport electricity, the use of certain alternatives such as generators, thunder, to name but a few, cause enormous losses for the population both in human lives and with regard to household electrical equipment. To respond to this problem, our research team at the Mamou IST center has set up a device to cut the circuit when the voltage level no longer corresponds to that expected in the circuit. This device is practically operational and will be available for low-income households.
