Digital Inclusion &amp; Future Skills Pilot
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that youth in rural areas, working on agriculture value-chains don't have digital skills and future oriented skills that can help them improve their businesses, find better employment or create new business opportunities.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



As a country with a predominantly young population, the demand for more Internet access, more digital services and digital connection is growing. However, Internet connection is a reality for a small percentage of the population. Many rural areas are particularly affected by a lack of reliable infrastructure and affordable solutions. Therefore, rural and peri-urban communities are left behind, there is an unequal distribution of (digital) literacy and digital opportunities. As digitalization grows, digital skills are increasingly important, especially when it comes to business development and management, access to new career paths, information, services and education for business management.

Likewise, there is a growing conflict between traditional educational curricula and more attractive work and business opportunities that are increasingly digital and unconventional, which requires a new set of skills, mindsets and digital literacy. Digital and project-based education remains very basic for the majority of the country's population and there are very few alternative and professional trainings to equip young people who cannot afford academic training. The future of work in Angola will depend on its social and human capital. Diversifying, transforming and modernizing the educational system will be essential for the country to boost economic development, create jobs and become competitive on a global scale.




> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Level of digital literacy in rural areas is very low according to the statistics. Connectivity in peri-urban and rural areas is also very low.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Most youth in rural areas are engaged in the agriculture value-chains but mostly on the commercialization and administrative tasks. However they are not able to use digital tools to enable them to improve their work, engage in e-commerce and increase access to market. Majority of youth finds agriculture related jobs not attractive moving to urban centers to look for other opportunities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab has identified this challenge while designing the portfolio on future of work. The Accelerator Lab has the capacity to co-create a learning package together with the private sector and the communities that can be tested in a short learning cycle to be adjusted before scaling-up.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



UNDP Angola is testing an experimental digital inclusion and future skills training program specially tailored to youth working in the agriculture value-chains in the rural ar

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We want to learn what are the main digital and soft skills that can increase the capacity of youth in rural areas and attract them to better jobs in the agriculture value-chains.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Testing and experimenting a co-created curricula to test how it improves the capacities of a group of 20 young girls and boys. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



There are no similar curricula tailored and designed for youth in rural areas and cooperatives. Only by testing it out and seeing the results will it be possible to learn and adapt and eventually scale-it up.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



There are 5 ways to grow: a) through the existing training centers that Salesianos or INEFOP have around the country including it in the national professional, technical and vocational training offer; b) through the INAPEM supported Cooperatives around the country, c) through the FAO supported cooperatives around the country. c) scale it to UNDP supported cooperatives; d) all of the above mentioned, by having a mobile training vehicle that can go to all the cooperatives. The goal is to have a UNDP learning package that can be deployed by different partners after a training of trainers and a good scaling-up strategy.
