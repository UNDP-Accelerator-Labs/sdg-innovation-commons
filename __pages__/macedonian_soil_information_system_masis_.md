> Description of the solution

MASIS is designed to gather and organize various data related to soil characteristics, including texture, pH, and salinity, which can be crucial for informing agricultural practices and policymaking. The system aims to help stakeholders make evidence-based decisions to promote sustainable agriculture and manage soil resources effectively. MASIS will also make it possible to monitor soil condition and determine how human interventions, such as land use changes and climate change, affect it.

> Additional notes

The new Macedonian Soil Information System or ‚ÄúMASIS‚Äù ‚Äì formally launched hin 2015 and was developed with support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Global Soil Partnership. MASIS is expected to be fundamental for guiding decision making at national and local levels, from policy to action-oriented fields such as land use planning, land suitability assessment, soil fertility policies, soil degradation, climate change adaptation, ecosystem services, and implementing the new global Sustainable Development Goals.
