Gamified Recycling: The BitEgreen Pilot, created by the Caribbean Environmental Management Bureau, was pitched at the 2019 "Blue Tank" challenge facilitated by the Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. In response to inefficient waste management practices, the pilot involves the development of a recycling/circular economy system which uses technology and gamification to incentivize participation. To do so, the proposal assigned a monetary value to reusable and recyclable material for all citizens and corporations as a catalyst for a new circular economy model. In practice, it applies barcode scanner sales, smart trash cans, reverse vending machines, mobile phones and an integrated online marketplace.
