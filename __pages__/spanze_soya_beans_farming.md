> Title of the innovation

SPANZE Soya beans farming

> Brief description of the innovation

Soyabean farming in Zambia speed up economic growth and alliviate poverty which has an effect on attitude and values.
We evaluated the influence of cropping system and tillage system on yield we were satisfied as a team on some quality characteristics of Soyabean seeds and economic outcome.
We have been dealing in Soyabean farming at a small scale, and to the lager extent we do have dreams to reach a level where our contribution to the 7 th development plan of this country will be meaningful.
Soyabean not only
Soyabean farming opens doors of opportunities for Zambia farmers notably, the climate in Zambia is largely favourable hence taking advantage in being among the farmers who are contributing to the well being of the country s economy.
As a way of mitigating the effects of climate
Climate change, we doing Maize/ Soyabean program, a program aimed at mitigating the climate change effects.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will be very easy for the Soyabean farming to generate income for me and others this is because the Zambian soy market is self sufficient and growing rapidly with some exports with production dominated by commercial farmers and considerable scope for income generation for me and others.
This will also improve operations of other existing businesses such as fish feed which is made from Soy and other products, our target market ranges from house holds, shopping malls, health institutions, education institutions , commercial farmers and many more, this we believe will assist in improving operations of operations of existing businesses.
The prices on the market is determined by the demand of the commodity which is very high in Zambia and other neighbouring countries and communities, so our earlier specified target market has potential to help the business grow.
Soyabean has been more profitable than any other crop in Zambia coupled with important nutritional and commercial crop for small holders, It is self sufficient and growing rapidly with some exports, with production dominated by commercial farmers and considerable scope for income generation for the group.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is designed at being the best way of helping with the new adapted production farming system
We did an instropective of our previous farming by years and proved beyond point that the financial viability of the proposed project for the agriculture and development plan go side by side with identification of sustainable production systems appropriate to the consumers. Our implementation planning strategy is aimed at progressing from small scale farmers to plans having  to establish a soya been processing plant with the capacity of 20.50 tons per day.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation can improve the lives of others in that, it will create jobs,
The use of Soyabean in food industry has increased gradually, as it is useful for production of many values. Added products like milk cheese, soya chunks, oils and many more, the production of many products help people in nutrional value as added value to the bodies hence improving the lives of many people direct or indirect.
The innovation to the current market is very safe in terms of current prevailing high demand of the commodity.
