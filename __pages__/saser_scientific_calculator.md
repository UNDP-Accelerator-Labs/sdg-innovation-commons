This is the first scientific calculator built by Malaysian. This non-programmable calculator comes with transformation modes such as translation, reflection, twist and augmentation. It is able to determine the image coordination accurately once the object coordination and transformation instruction are keyed in. Moreover, it is user-friendly, doesn't require high cost, time-saving and easy to use. The innovation has received gold medals at the International Engineering Innovation Exhibition (i-ENVEX) 2018 and International Young Scientist Innovation Exhibition (IYSIE) 2018.
