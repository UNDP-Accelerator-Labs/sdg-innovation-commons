> Title of the innovation

Art for Climate Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Art for Climate Zambia is a social and creative enterprise, now a waste management company legally registered in Zambia  that seeks to provide solutions to complex environmental problems using the influence of science, technology and artistic creations.
The company has a vision to achieve environmental sustainability through artistic creations and people as an integral part of the recycle chain in order to realize climate change resilience, mitigation and adaptation.
The company has a wide array of products and services ranging from building materials, visual arts, smart agriculture, household deco and sensitization. The company aims at promoting a circular economy through an integrated recycle chain; creating wealth from trash; creating green jobs and women empowerment as well as influence behavior change.
Our main products includes:
Eco blocks made from plastic waste and liqor bottles without any use of cement, water and sand; Mobile green houses made out of locally sourced materials, that permits farmers to transport their merchandise to and from the market without any waste and sell as fresh as they are.The greenhouse is powered by gravity irrigation and very cost effective. Sculptures made from waste materials, husehold decoration materials such as Chrismas trees and artificial flowers from PET bottles.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The company will be specialized at producing highly competitive and quality building materials such as blocks, pavers, tiles and roofing sheets from plastic and glass waste materials. Also a producer of quality but cost effective mobile greenhouses made from locally sourced materials.

 Not to forget visual arts products as it sets a bar at becoming the largest local producer of household decoration materials and the company’s unique plastic sculptures and bins.

We plan to reach our target market through channels such as: Awareness, exhibitions, purchase, Delivery and after sales. To grow the business, we hope to strengthen our customer relationship through excellent service delivery such as courtesy, trust, and price efficiency. We will utilize offline and online channels to create visibility of our products and services such as Social media, Website, YouTube, and Business cards. 

 The plan includes procurement of company land and setup of permanent offices and production units; procurement or fabrication of equipment; mass production; and improvement on waste transportation.
 
The company will remove tonnes of plastics, glass, paper, scrap and other waste materials from the environment needed to manufature it's products. The company will promote sustainable agriculture and cities.

> Technical Feasibility

The Eco blocks
The innovation involves the manufacturing of construction blocks extracted from a molten composite of plastic and glass aggregates. The mixture is heated in a heat  in order to extract a molten composite we can utilize for making building materials such as eco-blocks equal or stronger and denser compared to conventional concrete blocks. The apparatus includes equipment such as a plastic and glass shredder, a mix densifier, and a mold with customized shape depending on the type of material being manufactured. 

2. The mobile greenhouse
The company has furthermore developed a prototype of cost effective mobile greenhouse that will permit farmers to transport their produce straight to the market fresh. Some of the unique components of this technology is that it uses simple and relatable materials any farmer could source such as common polyethelene plastics, scrap metal, Wires, PET bottles among others; it also uses gravity powered irrigation system and finally the green house is able to move from one place to another using any teansport mode such as animal, bycicles, vehicles etc. The innovation will help in marketing farmers products, reduce food waste, and help farmers access lattest and trending technologies using locally sourced materials.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Art for climate Zambia has embarked on a journey to expand its dream to an investment strategy that will transform the company into a self-sustainable business. the company will largely contribute to the country’s economy by providing green jobs to young people, women empowerment as well as contribute to a circular economy through its waste management innovative products and services.

Through it's building products such as eco blocks, also investment into smart agriculture using waste, and artistic creations will largely help:

•	Minimize the generation of waste. Improve the efficiency of waste collection. 
•	Create behavioral change among the general public towards waste management. 
•	Create green jobs as well as improve community livelihood(women, youths, people living with disabilities and other marginalised groups) by converting trash into treasures. 
•	Contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs) by promoting a circular economy. 
•	Make the general public part of the recycling chain through Litter sensitization programs. 
•	Reduce on the amount of waste that goes to landfills and add value to any waste generated. Convert waste into construction materials to reduce high living.
