Overall goals:  - Promote informed citizen participation   - Contribute towards the supervision and monitoring of the Riachuelo Sanitation Plan  - Enhance the level of protection of natural areas with significant ecosystemic value   - Modify economic activities with a high negative impact   - Improve the quality of life of people living in the Matanza-Riachuelo basin, especially of vulnerable inhabitants   Specific goals:  - Strengthen social monitoring capabilities and the resulting influence of citizens on the public policies implemented in the territory   - Improve the speed and effectiveness of the complaint mechanisms available to people living in the basin to enable mainstreaming issues into the solutions required for each case  

Description of citizen participation: What's Up Riachuelo? (¿Que pasa Riachuelo? in Spanish) involved a virtual space constituted by a network of civil society organizations. As an environmental platform, it promoted online monitoring by way of citizen supervision and reporting, classified into 4 thematic areas:   I) Industries with legal and environmental risk rates ii) Open dumping sites   iii) Slums and settlements   iv) Territorial alerts     A photojournalism contest for hobbyists was held in 2013. To participate, neighborhood groups and residents living in the basin had to send images showing its condition, considering the Sanitation Plan established by the Supreme Court of Justice. 

Time frame. 1/10/2011 - 2015
