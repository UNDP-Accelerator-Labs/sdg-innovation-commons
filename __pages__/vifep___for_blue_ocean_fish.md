Plastic Pollution Challenge: Viet Nam currently has approximately 47,450 offshore and middle shore fishing vessels and about 300,000 fishermen in these waters. Since the vessels do not have plastic trash storage onboard, it is estimated that they dump about 1,400 tons of plastic waste at sea annually.

Solution: We provide a mini plastic squeezing machine and a mobile app for local fishermen to collect and convert plastic waste into necessary supplies for fishing activities. In the long run, the project is expected to reduce approximately 1,400 tons of plastic waste per year.

Innovation: The plastic squeezing machine is made of saltwater resistant materials and designed to fit in tight spaces on fishing vessels. and. It is operated with an electrical system on-board, and helps to reduce the size of used plastic bottles on-board by about 90%. Fishermen will bring back the plastic waste to the ports where they can exchange it, via a mobile app, for supplies for their next trips to sea, such as instant noodles, milk, mobile credit, shampoo, tooth paste, drinking water, cooking oil, etc.

Impact Model: The ultimate impact goals of the team include, but are not limited to: protect the ocean that is the habitat of fisheries resources; develop feasible mechanisms and policies for the collection of plastic waste from fishing vessels and exchange for goods. Our goals contribute to the achievement of the SDGs:
