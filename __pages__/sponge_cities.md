> Type of the Solution

Infrastructural

> Description of the solution

A sponge city, according to Chinese guidelines is one that has transformed hard surfaces, such as roads

and pavements into permeable surfaces that can absorb, seep, purify and store water and later release


stored water for use.


Sponge cities allow urban areas to absorb water in times of high rainfall and release it in times of drought. These concepts could be used in cities across the world to combat flooding, absorb carbon dioxide, increase animal and plant life, and expand green spaces.





> Who lead the solution

Local Government

> Other Notes

Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development


Zhungai a city of 2.4 million in the Guangdong-HongKong-Macao Greater Bay Area is part of a pilot project in China promoting sponge cities.


After achieving success in China, the sponge city model has attracted over-exposed climate zones such as Dhaka and Kenya, as well as major cities like Berlin and Los Angeles.
