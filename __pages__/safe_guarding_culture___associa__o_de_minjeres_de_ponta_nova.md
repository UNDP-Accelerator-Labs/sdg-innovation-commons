Nhana Sedi is the president of the Associação de Minjeres de Ponta Nova, women who dye fabric and sell it for a living. A tradition from saracule tribe, passed on from generation to generation. Other local tribes such as Fula, Mandinga and Balanta are now all working in this area and learning of this technique of dyeing fabric. The advantage of this association is that it create employment of women in Bafata, teaches them new skills, gives visibility to the culture of dyeing clothes in a traditional manner.  The association is an advocate for preservation of culture and believe this is a way to preserve their culture and still be able to sustain their households.
