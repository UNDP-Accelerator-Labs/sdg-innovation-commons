## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

A comprehensive sensemaking was conducted in 3 municipalities of the hill tract districts to understand the common behavior and the systems of managing healthcare and general waste. During the sensemaking a large group of stakeholders including the Mayor of the municiplity, along with other councilors, healthcare staff, private sector, and different local committees came together to identify the general problems and find out their innovative solutions. The ecosystem between the general and healthcare waste is quite segregated in the general setting of waste management. The sensemaking workshop has provided a sense of awareness among the stakeholders who are directly or indirectly involved in waste management.  Whole of society approach is the best approach to make Healthcare and General waste model more effective in terms of ecosystem. CBOs in the municipalites are highly interested to contribute and to make the waste management effective - they have contexual expertise as well. Methods applied in the exploratory phase are: Sensemaking workshop, Small group discussion, one to one discussion, FGD, online meeting, large group discussion, qualitative and quantitative data, estimation of behavioral data.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally
- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

This action leaning plan is still not in the phase of handover to other entities. As this is a pilot programme of the UNDP AccLab to emphasize on the establishment of ecosystem of general and healthcare waste. We have just successfully completed the sensemaking and mapping of the needs and requirements. At this stage, we are collaborating with the local government (municipalities), healthcare staff, private sector, educational institutions, and different other local committees to amplify awareness on ecosystem and promote an workable ecosystem that would impove the current segregated waste management of the cities. If our pilot experiement shows any significant achievement in its' way, then the programme would be handover to the local government bodies to carry out further. As this is going to be a continuous process and once the system is established effeciently, responsibilities would be undertaken to sustain the system for long.


## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Before jumping to this initiative, we were lacking the essential data on the ecosystem of healthcare and general waste. We had a very obscure data and statistics on the number of waste, waste staff, waste management equipment, and the challenges that are impeding the development of the ecosystem of waste in any particular location. As we could not fully depend on the previously inherited data that are not viable in terms of their source of collection. So, we had to choose these data type to minimize the gaps in available data for future forcasting and preparing data-oriented decision making. We conducted sensemaking workshop, small group discussion, one to one discussion, FGD, online meeting, large group discussion, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, and estimation of behavioral data. These data helped us to enhance our understanding on the practiced system of waste management through bringing all the stakeholders in one single platform and showing the real picture of general and healthcare waste management.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The applied innovation method was noteworthy in a sense of its applicability to understand the complex nature of the problem area and frontier challenges. To simply understand the complexity, there was no alternative to engaging the stakholders for systematic adaptation of the process. Prior to unpacking the system, these methods of senesmaking, small group discussion, focus group discussion, and discussiong with key stakeholders provided compulsory data and information to plan strategically. Through these processes, we have identified the key area by collecting and analyzing the suggestions coming from different stakeholders. By learning the context and based on priority set up, we shortlisted our experiments and key activities. Also, these methods has opened up the possibilities of continuous learning to improve the system time to time.Mainly to understand the complex challenges and solutions which provided valuable insights.
