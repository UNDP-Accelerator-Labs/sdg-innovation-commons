A
shrine made of cooking oil plastic jerry can. The plastic jerry can was cut off to
form a shrine where candles and statue are put together. It is fixed with
bottle lid  and screws to the wall.  Jerry Can are mainly used to filled with water to support household water supplies.  Because there are lots of jerry can in every household some people in many suburbs in DIli reuse them not only to fill water but to use as a mean of creativity such as making shrines out of jerry can.
