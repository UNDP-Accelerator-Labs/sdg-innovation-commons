## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To develop innovative activities (games and sports) that both people with and without disabilities can engage.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the selected team are trained with innovative methodologies from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co: Lab, such as sense-making, grassroots innovations mapping, system thinking, co-creation, and experimentation, they will be able to develop creative solution on food system.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Experiment and implementation (month 5-7):
-	The three winning teams test their ideas and implement their developed inclusive activities for PWDs and people without disabilities.
-	UNDP provides mentorship support along the experiment and implementation process 
-	UNDP organize a final pitching for the three teams to present their experimenting journey and results. One team will receive extra grants to scale up their ideas.
