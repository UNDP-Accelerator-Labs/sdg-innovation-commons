## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Most low-income households still rely on biomass as source of energy even in major urban areas where different sources of energy available with charcoal being the main fuel for over half of households. - LPG is associated with high risk of accidents and incidents like fires and explosions and this is one reason why many households do not take up the fuel. Increasing energy transition needs to address perception and behavioral biases on specific forms of energy. - Analyzing willing-to-pay for LPG has shown that what consumers were willing to pay for a new equipment of LPG was very close to the market price for those items, which hints that that could be demand for LPG if other issues in the value chain are sorted. - A proposed financial service that would allow consumers to get energy through credit and pay in installments was one of the most valued for which consumers were willing to pay the highest deposit amount. This service could be key to incentivize transition to cleaner energy. - Issues with value chain such as low distribution network for certain forms of energy still persist.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Most formal businesses in energy sector do not have services that facilitate the inclusion of low income consumers. From distribution stores that are very far away from poorly planned neighborhoods, product offering, to pricing and financial models that are not favorable to the low income who mostly work in informal sector and have liquidity constraints.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Most of the previous literature was based on general surveys but our team wanted produce more specific evidence especially about the possible solutions. We organized experiments and games that were run in a controlled environment to quickly test some of our explore barrier for transition to clean energy and test some of the hypotheses we had based on the current literature.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used gamification to understand decision making in household environment. This was the most cost effective way to try to understand what are some of the barriers for energy transition and what would happen if we deployed some of the solutions that we are proposing. Since the solution we propose are not currently existing in the market it would be difficult to predict if these would work. Gamifying decision with participation of the potential beneficiaries allowed us to simulate possible outcomes of our future field experiments and better design the solutions that we are proposing.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with several UNPD partners in selection of the participants of the workshop that we organized. We invited about 10 community based organizations to propose volunteers according to our criteria of area of residence and income. The list that was sent by these organizations was used to then randomly select participants.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Our team did not work with new UNDP partners

NA
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Using gamification, participatory design, lab experiments, and survey allow us to generate very detailed data which in general would be challenging to get. On the other hand, we were able through this methodology, to quickly and efficiently produce insights about hypothetical solutions that we will be taking to field testing in the future.

Acceptability for post pay plan (credit plan) was higher than other services tested. In average consumers were willing to pay twice as much in deposit to adhere to this service than they were willing to pay for other services.
