The Color Movement is a co-creation between Catholic Sisters, Alight (formerly American Refugee Committee), and Sisters Rising Worldwide. The main objective is to amplify and sustain the work of the Sisters as they spark change and save lives in some of the toughest communities out there.

Catholic Sisters are the guiding stars as they bring support to the communities that need to thrive, and share their stories.

How it all began

The work with Sisters Rising Worldwide first took root in El Salvador and then along the U.S.-Mexico border. TCM found that the Sisters were some of the most impactful, inspiring, and beloved members of the community, making change day in and day out. The Sisters in El Salvador offer an alternative identity to a life of violence, one that thrives on goodness, peace and unity. And the Sisters on the border act as first-responders and frontline humanitarians, helping families survive some of the darkest times of their lives.

Through increased support and collaboration from the Color Movement, they're putting more resources into the Sisters’ hands, strengthening their work in El Salvador and at the border. But that’s just the beginning. The movement is going global, responding to the coronavirus around the globe, and getting behind Sisters who are helping to keep their communities safe.

How it works

A colorful, joyful identity is sometimes what communities need to rally under. This can look like Color Movement murals at youth centers, where before there was a blank and peeling wall. It can look like our buttons and t-shirts for people on the move, uniting them in peace, or it can look like original Color Movement art pieces created by young people and proudly hung on their bedroom walls.

They channel support both big and small, and tailored to their specific communities – things like new youth centers, school supplies, vocational training, computers, recreational equipment for migrant shelters, painting classes, women’s empowerment programs, gloves, masks, and soap for coronavirus prevention, and more.

As they share stories of this women-powered movement, they're also helping people see and find the Sisters, and help the Sisters find each other. In El Salvador, this looks like bringing in local advocates and partners like Global Shapers San Salvador, adding a spark of creativity, talent, and connections that bridge the gap between Sisters and the wider community. Or it can look like Zoom calls with Sisters from all over the world, swapping ideas and building solidarity during a time of isolation. Or connecting Sisters to medical advisors and COVID-19 experts for virtual training as they navigate the uncertain waters of the pandemic.

The Color Movement in La Chacra community

The space created in the community of La Chacra, in Soyapango, was born out of the desire to have a space for young people.  For its construction, we began to investigate a human-centered design with the young people who were in the different programs implemented by the volunteers of The Color Movement. This activity allowed a greater understanding of what were the struggles of these young people in their contexts.

From this, it was understood that the young people lacked a space to develop and carry out leisure activities; they had their homes but there were also their families, they went to school with their peers but there were also other dynamics because they were in an academic space. And apart from those two places, they had no other available space but the street. So it was decided to create a space that became a tool for the development of young people, who were looking for recognition, involvement, and to be heard. This is how this space was designed in La Chacra, as an opportunity for them to make decisions.

The color palette responds to the Color Movement, and it is through these tones that we seek to fill the communities with color. However, the real estate design responds to a modularity that can be generated from common materials in the area. So within this space there are square tubes, corrugated sheets, and other materials that are easily available in the country. In addition, modules were designed so that they could be assembled within the space with the community, which allowed us to teach the young people involved to use tools, to have a perception of how to take care of the furniture, and work tools. It was hoped that the young people would believe that if they can change four walls, it is very likely that they can change their entire community.

The most important thing to highlight with the design and creation of the space was the word ''belonging'', which was something that the young people longed for and that was missing within the community. This sense of belonging was created through the creation of the space which is a place where young people can carry out their activities, it is a space where they feel safe and that helps them to focus on what they really want for their future.
