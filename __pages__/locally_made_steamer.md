When the COVID 19 pandemic gained momentum in 2020, a lot of people in Eswatini turned to steaming as a defense/ prevention mechanism against and to treat symptoms of the virus. Although a traditional treatment for flue symptoms, steaming wasn't totally new to the Swazi culture. however, it was mostly associated with traditional healing methods. However, when COVID hit, such traditional methods gained some popularity. this solution therefore was developed to meet the growing demand for steaming needs around the country with the aim of reducing accidents associatedwith traditional steaming from an open pot or basin.
