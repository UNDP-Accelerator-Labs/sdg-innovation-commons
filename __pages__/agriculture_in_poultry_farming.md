> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In particular eggs and meat production from broilers and layers，everything in poultry farming is profitable even the manure can be sold to earn extra money.More people are demanding white over red meat，making demands for poultry product a business choice for many.Their is a market for these because everyone， rich or poor and young or old eats poultry products.Hence this will create permanent employements to my local people，cheat eggs and meat to small local shops business reducing poverty.At large scales export can be made like one largest export in America obtains most of their income from exportation of this same poultry product from local farms.Simple and very archievable，with GOD Blessing hand we can even be the world largest export of poultry products.

> Technical Feasibility

first Thing which might be required is land to build two poultry houses for the broiler chickens and layers.Broiler chicken require nice clean dry room to accommodated their fast growing bodies so size of poultry must accommodate all given chickens without crowding.Drafting mus be minimise until the chicks are fully covered with feather this can be reduced by installation of draft barrier using cardboxes.A good  source of heat must be supplied traditionally we use light heaters，but infrade light fitted with a shield which reflect heat on the chickens.A good source of water and feeding materials.In the other poultry will be used for layers，which are raised either by litter or cage system (most recommended).Cage is suitable for commercial farming poultry Will be kept under a single shed.It structure should be wider and higher as compared to the Broiler poultry .Drop ceiling is required to lmprove ventilation.Proper cooling and heating devices are required as these poultry bird are sensitive to temperature  and also a light source.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Running these two facility requires man power most of the local youths hence employment will be creator to about 30 to 40 people in my community，Than when their were working on bus statios grabbing money from conductors.Cheap and affordable  poultry product to my community.Small children from schools can be educated on poultry farming etc.Facilities like this can also improve small businesses from my area where they can obtain Cheap trays of eggs chickens and meat product.All this will improve local businesses in area creating a better  zambia for all.
