An initiative to open music studio play parks in cities and communities to support unemployed youths and to create employment.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As we wish to open music video studio play parks we realise that about 300 people a day record new songs and videos and post on media of which this gives us picture of how active the studio would be every day  and since our play park will have instruments we wish to teach how to use music equipment and how to operate a studio such activities will bring income.
Our target market is the society economic development and sustainability 
Our target is to sale services to the general public in order to help them find independent solutions for their survival in society.
This may save the environment from different activities such as crime theft public vandalism and indiscipline.

> Technical Feasibility

Our vision carries a double standard  of community benefits and the two are mainly focused on creating a self empowerd youth environment and second is to create platforms that bond youth creativity and education
We wish to open sound studio play parks in different cities,these parks will help reduce unemployment levels as it will create employments to those who will work at the play parks. This will also help the youths and non youths to promote their skills and talents and this will help reduce crime as it creates a better focus for the youths who have not had an opportunity to be educated.this idea comes with likes of what injuries that had been left in most communities in the country as we noticed that most communities have no play parks because new malls where being built on the play parks and libraries

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will impart the lives of youths it will enable youths earn financial support to establish their own businesses as this will lead to less demand for employment as youths will be indipendent and will craete employment for others
