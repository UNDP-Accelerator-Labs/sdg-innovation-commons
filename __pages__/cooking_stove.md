A lot of people in the communities rely on using firewood and charcoal for cooking due to a lack of access to clean and sustainable energy. This has resulted in deforestation and other environmental shocks. The stove combines the use of a few firewood and electricity to reduce firewood and briquette use. It works perfectly when firewood is mixed with lava rocks, 80% lava, and 20% firewood.
