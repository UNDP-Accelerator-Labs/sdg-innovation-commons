## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1) The JERODD youth network succeeded in collecting specific data on SDGs 13 and 16 because the majority of respondents were young people outside public authorities. The approach has shown value for money and efficiency by leveraging the thirst of young people to learn and act voluntarily for their communities.

2) the trend in data collected on SDG 13 highlights the impact of climate change in remote areas and a strong weakness in planning and interventions toward a sustainable response in favor of populations at the last mile

3) data collected on SDG 16 about young people associated with violent armed groups revealed a common imprint of root causes that generate cases of violent extremism in the eastern region of the DRC

4) the usage of digital tools such as KoboToolbox had limitations in places where network coverage is weak. The use of digital forms with printed ones in the event of technical insufficiency of Kobo was the only means of successful data collection

5) Failing to take into account the challenges of climate change and the trend towards violent extremism in local planning and governance posed a risk of regression in the gains of last-mile development interventions



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The collection protocol target and the commitment of a network of young volunteers aroused the interest of the provincial government of Tshopo which requested support from the UNDP to carry out the same collection process to supply its development plan for 2024 onward

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

This is the first time that data on last-mile development challenges has been collected with a focus on SDG indicators at the local level. This approach, executed in collaboration with provincial authorities, can fill the local planning gap due to the lack of pro-SDG data.  The planning is yet to be pro-SDG driven and this the 1st of its kind attempt to bridge the gap from beneficiaries' perspectives (Proof of concept)



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Data Visualisation: was key to addressing localized and specific trends from the data collection. It was a way to map the root causes of violent extremism and climate change patterns. 

Micro-narratives: were used to attach a human-centric storytelling on the last mile development gap to serve on future resource mobilisation

Proof of concept: the approach is the 1st of its kind to try youth engagement as a way to cover the SDGs data gap from a last-mile perspective. Through the combined effort from local authorities, Universities, and Youth network JERODD on data collection, this approach intends to isolate the lack of local SDG data as the main issue in local developement planning with evidence


## Partners

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

In collaboration with the decentralization program, we leveraged existing partnerships with local government to act within the approach as a key enabler for Youth network activation, training, and data collection deployment. We worked with the local government and their division of planning to secure the process of recruiting youth, training them, and deploying the data collection with their support in preparing the collection targets before the rollout
