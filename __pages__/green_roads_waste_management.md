> Description

Green Roads is an innovation that build roads with recycled plastics. Concrete mixed with shredded plastic have an excellent binding property which can replace bitumen by acting as the binding agent. As per experiments in different construction sites in different provinces of Nepal, these roads have lasted longer, better water seepage, cost effective and are significantly less prone to cracks and potholes in comparison to conventional asphalt roads. To build a 100 meter roads, More than 100,000 plastic wrappers (which would have otherwise ended up in landfill) are used to build a 100 meter road.
