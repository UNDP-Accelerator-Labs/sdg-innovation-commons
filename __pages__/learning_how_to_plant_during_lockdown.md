Learning how to plant during lockdown

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

During the lockdown in Mauritius, a lot of people (including members of my family) had to learn how to plant (in case something bad happens which, fortunately, didn't happen). But, in the process, people who had never ever planted something learned about the different kids of soils, the use of fertilisers, the different kids of seeds, etc. This knowledge, in many cases, was passed to children.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The need, at the very least, to continue eating. Of course, someone who had never planted cannot aspire to quickly be in a position to become self-sustainable in terms of food but this is an important first step.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

In situations of crisis, people need to innovate.
