## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital Transformation and Digital Financial Inclusion in Trinidad and Tobago


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that members of society in Trinidad and Tobago need more efficient and transparent access to public services. Also, socially displaced, rural and vulnerable people need quicker access to digital government benefits and new avenues for economic empowerment which do not require physical contact and exchange of cash.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Trinidad and Tobago has prioritised inclusive digital transformation as an urgent need for national development. The longstanding desire of the government to transition the country to a modern, digitalised society was escalated to priority status during the height of the recent COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) when ministries were pressed to quickly and expeditiously deliver services to the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago in manner that is remote, safe, contactless and simple for all users – government and private citizen. Digital government transformation is a critical enabler of social inclusion since it can improve access to government services and information for members of society who may otherwise be excluded. Digital technologies can make it easier for citizens to access government services online, a factor that can be especially beneficial for residents of remote or underserved areas, or persons with disabilities that make it difficult for them to physically visit government offices. Despite these potential benefits, the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT) Digital Inclusion Survey (2021) revealed that only 2.9% of men and 4.1% of women have accessed government services online. Less than 21.2% of men and 31% of women believe that online transactions are secure. This highlights the fact that only a small portion of the population benefits from online services, a fact that further exacerbates socio-economic inequalities. The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (“GORTT”) recognizes that the convergence of telecommunications, broadcasting and various aspects of information and communications technology (“ICT”), and the opportunities and impact of ICT as a socio-economic tool and an economic enabler as critical to national development. In March 2022, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) conducted a Digital Readiness Assessment[1] of Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of the GORTT. The DRA, which is non-representative digital survey-based tool supported by research and analysis of available data, provided rapid, high-level insights into the country’s digital strengths and opportunities, as perceived and experienced by its citizens. According to the results, the digital readiness of Trinidad and Tobago is strong and is considered ‘systematic’ – meaning that the country is systematically advancing in key areas of digital transformation based on identified priority areas. However, while the DRA found that the general appetite of people for digital solutions to be strong, it noted that Government is challenged by a lack of cross-agency coordination and an absence of a whole-of-government approach. Basically, siloism is high. Furthermore, there is the need for strengthening of human resources resident within the Government with regard to digital approaches. Further, there is also the need for legislation that facilitates digital identification, e-signatures, financial technology (fintech) for business enablement and digital inclusion, and prudent data management.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is uniquely positioned to try new approaches and test new tools using an iterative methodology. This is exactly what is needed as the government works to develop new digital tools and processes aimed at benefiting all of society. Also, the Lab's focus on collective intelligence through engagement of unusual stakeholders from all sectors of society, is immensely beneficial to the government as they need to ensure the participation of all members of society in this national digital transformation. Often, the stakeholder outreach activities of government have not been effective, as they have been unable to engage vulnerable, displaced, rural, young, and migrant members of society. The Lab's inclusive and dynamic engagement approach ensures that all stakeholders are not just informed, but are actually fully involved in the process of solution design.



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Inclusion matters! The National E-ID will make government services efficient and accessible for all! After the #TTLab facilitated the #DigitalReadinessAssessment in #TrinidadandTobago, our #Government asked UNDP to develop the strategy and prototype an Electronic ID Mobile App!
