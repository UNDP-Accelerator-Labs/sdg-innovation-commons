> Description of the solution

The New York design Firm Deckrer Yeadon used muscles and homeostasis in biological systems as the inspiration for the double-skin glass facade system for large buildings. The facade resembles a window with a swirling design that opens and closes itself in response to changes in interior room temperature to permit or deny heat gain from the sun.
