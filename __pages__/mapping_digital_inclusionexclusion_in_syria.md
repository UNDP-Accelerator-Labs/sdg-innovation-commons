## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Mapping Digital inclusion/exclusion in Syria
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the number of individuals in Syria accessing internet and technology devices is decreasing. Currently some basic services in Syria require internet and a smart phone while a lot of people might be excluded due to the increased price of internet services and smart devices.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Current interventions by UN agencies and INGOs focus on humanitarian response and early recovery projects like food security, nutrition facts …etc. neglecting the issues related to digital exclusion, which is affecting Syrians lives in many ways.   In this era, Digital access is not a luxury but a fundamental need for people at a global level.   At the local level in Syria, “Way-in” the government mobile app used by Syrians to order the subsidized products including (sugar, rice, fuel, cooking gas….) requires internet connection and a smart phone to function, at the same time government policies are pushing toward the implementation E-services and E-pay solutions for the public and private sector.   The crisis that has been going through Syria for the past 10 years resulted in increased prices of digital equipment, a devaluation of the local currency, a reduced purchasing power, increased customs on digital equipment and increased ISP prices. Those factors contributed to more digital exclusion of the most vulnerable.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

 On a local level, Accelerator lab will be working on mapping the digital inclusion/exclusion in Syria. The process will evaluate four components:   ·       Access:  the access to devices and internet ·       Skills: the digital skills and ability to use the apps ·       Use: Services used and accessed ·       Supportive environment: trust and security   Using data collection methods and tools we will collect data including:   1.      The number of people with stable access to internet. 2.     The number of people who own a smart phone. 3.     The number of people with indirect access. 4.     The number of people totally excluded from the digital environment    

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Using citizen science, can we map the digital inclusion/exclusion scene in Syria and identify gaps in the current situations along with alternative solutions?
