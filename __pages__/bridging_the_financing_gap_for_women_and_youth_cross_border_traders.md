## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. The digital solution among the Small Scale Cross Border Traders was highly welcome given the challenge faced to continue with business during the COVID lockdown. 2. The uptake of the VillageSavers digital App was slow among the Small Scale Cross Border Traders due to challenges that ranged from faulty Smartphones and slow uptake of the digital approach at the start of the experimentation. As a result, continuous training was required to improve confidence in navigating around the App. Moving forward, a proposal was made to procure Smartphones for the 75 participants in the Experimentation to ensure they were able to download the Apps and work on them.  3. COVID-19 disproportionately impacted the financial capacities of some of the traders affecting their capacities to sustain participation in the Self-Help Saving Groups (SHGs). Moving forward, a proposal is being considered to introduce a Revolving Fund to match the income being raised by the 5 SHGs under the Experimental Group.  4. Most traders ordered their products from South Africa and used Zimbabwe as a Corridor. This opened an opportunity to set up an online Marketplace on the VillageSavers App. An opportunity that will be explored moving forward.

The learning was shared in an Exposure Article: https://stories.undp.org/in-zambia-and-zimbabwe-communal-savings-help-small-businesses-grow   The Africa Borderlands Annual Report: https://t.co/xIDMVEN3PW

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

COVID lockdown slowed progress on the implementation especially when required to cross over to Zimbabwe during joint mission trip with AccLab Zimbabwe team.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The testing is being done in real context so offers opportunity to include a mix of focus group discussion and participant observations. Participants in the experimentation were randomly selected to test the innovations which was designed following a series of co-creation sensemaking workshops involving key stakeholders. The end result of the learning cycle is a Proof of Concept

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Co-creation ensured the voice of all stakeholders were taken on board in the design of the Learning Cycle. Sensemaking workshops were organized where the key stakeholders came on board to offer their insights what the key issues were in cross border trading. Of importance was the input from the Cross Border Traders, which help to design the solution in response to the gaps they were experiencing as a result of COVID-19. The Proof of Concept is hoped to align the lessons learnt during the process to provide a model for possible offtake.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the Cross Border Traders Association (CBTA), whom we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for them to support the implementation of the Learning Cycle in their space. Participants of the learning are all members of the CBTA which is hoped to ensure continuity as the mother body is supporting the implementation of the activities over the period of the Learning Cycle.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Financial Institutions whose presence to offer financial services to the SHGs will ensure increment of the investment portfolios for the the Groups. One Bank - Zambia National Commercial Bank - is part of the Steering Committee that has been set up to support with the Learning Cycle. The other is the Innovators, who are registered as private entities for purposes of commercializing their innovations

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The following Government departments have a Steering Committee to support the traders participating in the Learning Cycle in accordance with their respective mandate, namely the Livingstone City Council, Immigration Department and Zambia Revenue Authority

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The ones identified under the Private partners are not usual partners within the UNDP, particularly the Innovator, whose innovation was the basis for the implementation of the Learning Cycle

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not directly working with them on this particular innovation, but engagement with IOM and UNCDF during the co-creation and scoping studies respectively, offered insights to the focus of the Learning Cycle
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The different methods helped with the learning process. Co-creation ensured involvement of all stakeholders at every stage of the learning process. It provided for the establishment of a Steering Committee to discuss and build on the learning. This helped inform the development of the proof of concept
