> Title of the innovation

Empowering for Rural Development: Adult Literacy and Sustainable Agricultural &amp; Enterprise Skills for Small-Scale Farmers and Commercial Farmworkers

> Brief description of the innovation

This proposed project focuses on the women and men who have taken agriculture as a way to earn their livelihood as well as those employed as waged agricultural workers - all at the very heart of rural development. Apart from forming the core of the rural poor, this group is disadvantaged in other respects. It is among the most socially and economically vulnerable, the least organised at individual, family and/or community level, lives under the poorest health, safety and environmental conditions, and is the least likely to have access to information - especially concerning their rights &amp; privileges - nor any effective forms of social security and protection. This is a multi- faceted programme that aims to go beyond the famous 3Rs – reading, writing and arithmetic - through equipping the small-scale farmers and commercial farmworkers with the necessary tools, competencies, abilities, confidence and willingness to competently engage with language to acquire, construct and communicate meaning in all aspects of daily living. Equipped with this tool, it will be anticipated that the group will be able to socially, culturally and economically engage with other stakeholders in a constructed system of communication

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Small-scale farmers and commercial farmworkers accounts for over 80% of the total agricultural workforce and is one of the major stakeholders in rural development. Currently this group is largely invisible in policy and decision-making, agricultural and rural development plans &amp; programmes, science and research activities, accessing agricultural banks and credit institutions nor does it have any visible representation in civil society organisations and groups. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that this is majorly due to high illiteracy levels and lack of skills in sustainable agricultural &amp; enterprise. And this is the narrative that this project aims to change. This programme aims at equip the group members through adult literacy programme and entrepreneurial skills training to actively participate in the entire rural development process. Hence, eliminating poverty, zero hunger, strengthening labour standards and human rights, and strengthening of structures, promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development and food security. With these tools, the group members and their respective communities will be able to adopt and practice climate smart agriculture (climate sensitive production technologies and usage of appropriate inputs that would conform to prevailing agro-ecological conditions) and entertain an idea of developing the rural areas through an increase in production and productivity

> Technical Feasibility

Implementing adult literacy and entrepreneurial skills training interventions is a complex process that includes numerous areas for consideration. Mainly adult learners often have great needs in literacy instruction and intervention. They need extensive support due to their life circumstances (newcomers, lack of prior academic success) and the educator (teacher) should have the required knowledge, skills and competencies to handle adult teaching and learning. Positive outcomes for adult learners may lead to improved outcomes such better ways of farming or carrying out one’s duties, job satisfaction, increased income, and family literacy.
The following is the implementation plan and the idea is to start with one province and spread out, depending on the availability of the resources: 
1.	Engaging the major stakeholders especially sponsors
2.	Learner identification &amp; construction of profiles
3.	Identification of educators and signing of contracts 
4.	Teaching &amp; learning methods, approaches and Instructional materials
5.	Instructional time
6.	Teacher preparation and training 
7.	Communication 
8.	Teaching &amp; learning environment &amp; processes

> Anticipated Social Impact

Literacy and sustainable agricultural &amp; enterprise skills are key to achieving social and economic prosperity (rural development). From our findings, over years of engaging small-scale farmers and commercial farmers and their workers, we have come to realise that small-scale farmers and commercial farm workers are a repository of experience, motivation, and resourcefulness but they are majorly illiterate and lack sustainable socio-economical tools. The proposed programme is relevant in that it aims to achieve the following, among others: 
	developing positive attitude and perception towards life and farming 
	increasing the capacity to produce a quality product – intangible and/or tangible
	capability to balance the demand and supply of skills
	attaining high self-esteem and self-confidence to productively engage the employer and other stakeholders
	improvement in soci0-economic life – both at individual and family (community) levels
	strong commitment towards embracing education as one of the major life transformers
	determination and ability to end poverty, dependence syndrome and self-pity
