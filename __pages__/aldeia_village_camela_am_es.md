Aldeia Camela Amões, nestled amidst the Lumbanganda mountain range, spans 40,000 hectares, offering a multifaceted solution to combat poverty in vulnerable contexts. 

The project encompasses housing, education, health, churches, shops, leisure, farmland, livestock, industry, forestry, tourism, and a wildlife reserve. Utilizing the rural setting, the initiative promotes a dignified lifestyle.

The village, featuring red earth blocks produced locally, prioritizes self-sustainable housing over traditional kimbos. Three configurations cater to technicians, local inhabitants, and tourism. Social housing, occupying half a hectare, includes recreational areas and space for vegetable gardens. Residents, part of a housing cooperative, pay for amenities over 40 years through agricultural produce.

Solar panels provide energy, and boreholes supply potable water. The village hosts wild animals and plans for ponds. Recognized at the Global Summit for Trade and Investment in Africa in Washington DC, the project emphasizes social impact by creating productive sectors in rural areas. The village includes a medical center, school, Protestant and Catholic places of worship, and an essential goods store.
