## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Tuzlyn Bayoh & Benson Kandeh

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

14th June 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Natural Resource Management

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How can innovative solutions developed by young people be supported to the market - creating & enhancing diversification  

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Will this new design solve the known pitfalls of the traditional design i.e open hand dug well (easily contaminated & accident prone especially for kids) 

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Likokwing University, Ministry of Water Resources
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To examine solution to see if the new design can solve the known pitfalls of the traditional design i.e open hand dug well (easily contaminated & accident prone especially for kids)  including cost comparison with the Indian MK 2 version which is the most popular design deployed by partners  

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If  this new local design can eliminate the stated problems with the traditional open hand dug well then more communities will be willing to transform their current design into the upgraded one If the solution is cost efficient then there can be a market for the product/service  

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Conduct water tests and user experience information 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Communtiy responses

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

interviews and administer survey questionnaires 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 1

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes it solves the issues with the open dug well and is less costly (less than half of the cost of deploying other wells designs)

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Nil the first well was done at the expense of the community 

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, findings from the first deployment has been shared with programmes staff 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes the solution was incorporated into an active project that had initially planned to drill boreholes and install pumps in 10 communities 

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report. 


## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The innovator has the type of tools that he uses to make drilling simpler and faster - unique process. The solution has an inbuilt filteration system - added value The solution has its limitation as the drilling tools & equipment cannot drill in all areas  The solution seem to follow the pressure pump process

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

access to water testing kits

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Sustainable Local Economic Development Cluster as this team works to promote youth empowerment & employment and fund start-ups with viable solutions

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Communities easy access to safe water
