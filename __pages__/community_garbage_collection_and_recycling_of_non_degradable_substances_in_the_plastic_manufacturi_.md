> Title of the innovation

Community garbage collection and recycling of non degradable substances in the plastic manufacturing industry and connecting the pipes of gasses released during the processing to other less harmful gasses

> Brief description of the innovation

Our communities In the compound have poor environment, most of the compounds are dirt or the land is polluted by the plastics and other non degradable materials that can be collected and converted to other substances in the industry and those that are degradable their life span can be measured as to when they can decay or others be converted into other forms of agriculture manure as the way to clean our environment and save it from land pollution.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will reduce land pollution and careless dumping of bins and litres in our compound making it dangerous as disease occurring ground.

> Technical Feasibility

First of all in this regard to achieve this all,we need tracks two or three that can be collecting garbage and find the dump site and in those dump site there is also a need to assign the workers who will be separating degradable from those non degradable substances and after that the degradable can be use or being converted to other agricultural substances while the non can be collected and taken to plastic companies.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can create jobs for those who are to be assigned for garbage collection and the agreement can also be signed between the council and the recycling companies of plastic products

> Name of the Innovator

- 19-35
