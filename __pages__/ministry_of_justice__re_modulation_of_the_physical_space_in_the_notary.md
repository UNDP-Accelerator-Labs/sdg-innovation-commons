## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Ministry of Justice: re-modulation of the physical space in the Notary
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand how the physical space impact the way that public service is delivered inside the Notary service in the Ministry of Justice in Bissau.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In the beginning of 2021, Lab embarked on a journey to explore further the challenges faced in the Ministry of Justice. It began by exploring the root causes of the lack of service provision in the Notary service, one of the causes or drives presented by users and staff was namely the physical space and the barriers it caused to meeting the needs of users and staff.

> 

From the Collective Intelligence workshops some of the weak signals characterizing the urgency of this challenge were: there is a lot of pressure, of people who come to get a service and they use phrases such as "I have to go to the embassy" which has nothing to do with the staff, the customers don’t understand and sometimes have aggression issues against the staff.  There is no security, so it makes the staff have a problem of their personal safety. There are poor work conditions and people can protect themselves from the violence which is often a problem too / the service has been around for too long, why has not been changed?  The room is cramped and the benches provided for people in line does not meet the standards for social distancing. There is a screen to call numbers, but is out of use as it was never installed properly.  The seats for staff are not comfortable for the long hours they sit around and there are no breaks as staff members its difficult.  The cause is that the problem has gone beyond what the Notary´s capacity, it no longer has the capacity to serve the people in the way which it was originated for.  Demand is too high, dynamism and enthusiasm are definitely present because the employees are young, but the conditions are just not good enough.   The "lack space" is the root cause, we must remodel the space or move us somewhere else.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is bringing an added value through joining hands with those who lives and operates closest to the problem, using new and innovative approaches such as Design Thinking and Collective Intelligence workshops, in order to co-create solutions with staff, users and other relevant stakeholders. It is worth investing in this challenge because MoJ is the first step of a citizens integration into society. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Join us in this journey how co-creation and transformation of physical space, can optimize service delivery.

## Learning questions

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Design Thinking, Collective Intelligence and Co-Creation will be used to structure the process and generate insights about the challenges faced as well as possible solutions in relation to the physical space in the Notary in the Ministry of Justice in Bissau. System thinking will be used to understand the underlaying drives of the challenge and visual thinking and mapping will be used as a supportive tool when engaging with different stakeholder. The value that these will add to our learning question is that we will be able to delve deeper into the challenge, better understanding the complexities as well as designing tests that can generate learning about different aspects of the challenge.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no available data of the experience of the staff and users in the MoJ. If we answer this learning question we might be able to generate learning for how to optimize the service for users and staff.
