## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.       Effective citizen participation takes time. Gathering and consulting citizens is not enough to involve them; it takes time and effort to design and execute meetings in which people and groups are really participants and can materially visualize the impact of their participation.

2.       We proved that people want to participate in long processes of participation, particularly if it comes to issues that impact their daily lives, such as mobility and public spaces.

Cooperation is key to public innovation. Throughout the process, there was a representation of citizens, municipality, subnational government, national government, and UNDP, allowing a solid basis, creating synergies of efforts and knowledge between the different organizations.

4.       The role of the Lab as a learnings articulator. Every time we plan a learning cycle, we state three maxims to guide our path: connect, learn, and share. In this project, the Lab served as an articulator, co-creatively planning the project with Moves, involving, and working together with governments, bringing new voices and methodologies, accompanying and co-designing each step and execution with the people.

5.       Demonstrative pilots serve to test new urban designs but also to sensibilize when it comes to inclusion. Although providing an inclusive urban design was one of the musts at the beginning of the process, it was not so easy to achieve. The process itself, mainly through the citizens voice helped to finally reach a human-centered perspective with inclusion at the core of the design.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One of the strengths of this learning cycle was at the same time one of the bottlenecks of it: the number of institutions involved. It took us some time to identify the best way to coordinate and move forward in the process with every stakeholder involved.

 

Another important challenge was to raise awareness on some of the crucial aspects of any tactical urbanism intervention. Even inside the core team it was sometimes difficult to engage with a human-centered design, conceived by the lens of the citizenship.

 

Another challenge was the involvement of the citizenship. The communication depended on the Municipality and several times many neighbors were not reached. It was a rather limited participation among neighbors.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

During the diagnosis phase, it was necessary to empathize with the neighborhood we were going to intervene. Thus, we tried a mix between quantitative data (geospatial, road casualties) and qualitative data (interviews, participatory observation, citizen-generated data). The mix of methods was crucial to determine the scope and location of the codesign process, which is not necessary the usual approach of urban planning policies. In fact, it helped to merge both perspectives before the actual design of the solution.

 

The co-design process consisted of seven participatory instances in direct contact with citizens. Neighbors, children, activists, and technicians were involved in the process. In each workshop different type of data was generated through surveys, social cartography, user journeys and many other participatory techniques that helped to achieve a design mainly elaborated by the people.

 

Finally, in the evaluation stage sensor data to measure speed, user journeys, direct interviews and surveys are being used to quantitative and qualitative understand the impact of the intervention. This intends to fill the gap on how to communicate the effectiveness of this kind of process and designs, and to guarantee the replicability of the experience.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We designed the challenge approach through design thinking because we wanted to find a solution empathizing with citizens perspectives, assuming that those who best know the challenge are those that tackle it on a daily basis. Participatory design and cocreation were present in the whole process because when urban designs are conceived from the lens of its users, they are most likely to succeed as they feel engaged and motivated with it. The previous methods were key to achieve a human centered design of the intervention, particularly when it comes to sustainability and inclusion. To contemplate vulnerable road users’ perspectives like the ones from pedestrians, cyclists, rollers, children, women and elderly was one of the aims we had and it was possible due to the mentioned methods.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Cyclists, rollers and skaters’ activist groups were involved in the codesign process as we aimed to incorporate their perspective in the urban design.

 

Also, neighbor schools participated in specific workshops designed to gain the children perspective of their urban environment.

 

Finally, neighbor organizations participated in several instances in order to represent the citizen voice.

Movés is a project that promotes an effective transition towards efficient, inclusive and low-emission mobility in Uruguay. It is financed by the Global Environment Facility, implemented by UNDP Uruguay and executed by Ministry of Industry and Mining, Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Housing and Land Planning. They are experts in sustainable mobility and are very interested in exploring experiences of tactical urbanism. Therefore, we created a partnership to work together implementing this experiment.  

 

Sub-national government of Canelones: the state government supported the project, provided the infrastructure, technical expertise and materials needed to execute the intervention. They also allowed the intervention in a public area and actively participated in the coordination of the whole process. The local government also supported operations through human resources.

 

Municipality of Ciudad de la Costa was also key in the whole process as they participated not only by providing materials location and their opinion, but also inviting neighbors to participate in it.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

None of the institutional partners mentioned above were new or unusual to UNDP. However, working all institutions together and horizontally with the citizenship made this partnership special.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Working together with a diversity of institutions and citizen organizations was one of the pros of this frontier challenge. It allows us to think on how to scale this experience and to count with valuable partners in all governance levels.

 

Due to coordination efforts and Lab´s engagement in the whole process it took us more time than it was originally planned. However, directly implement different innovation methods and use new forms of data allowed us to understand the valuable role that the Lab has to play in public innovation process. What is more, it helped to build capabilities inside and outside UNDP and to count whit a first-of-its kind pilot demonstration.
