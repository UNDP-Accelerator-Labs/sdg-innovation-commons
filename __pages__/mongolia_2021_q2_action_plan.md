## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital Literacy and Access (Mongolia)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

UNDP Accelerator Lab Mongolia identified digital transformation as its frontier challenge. We will focus on digital transformation in public services with a specific focus on leaving no one behind and closing the digital divide. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

UNDP Mongolia started the learning journey in systems thinking with the Sensemaking process in 2019, which then gradually transitioned to Transformational Journey the following year. CO completed the process with the establishment of the Accelerator Lab, which came onboard in January 2021. As the result of Transformative Journey, main 2 missions, Rebalanced Economy and Dignified Lives, were identified. To bring about these missions, the CO identified a cycle of desired interventions, such as “Low carbon transition,” “21st century value chains,” and “Digital Transformation”. Global development is moving to digital transformation, and with more than 2/3 of its population consisting of youth with high education obtainment share, there is a great opportunity for Mongolia to join this movement. As such, Mongolian government is committed to becoming a Digital Nation, and the strategy document with 6 main goals was approved in February 2021 by the Cabinet. The E-Mongolia, the main platform of government services, is actively being developed and expanded with around 180 government services integrated. Moreover, a specific program of action is being developed for each of the main goals of the Digital Nation Strategy. Mongolia is experiencing various issues on the digitalization path, including accessibility, infrastructure, human capital, architecture and access to finance. On the other hand, the general population, for whom the whole digitalization process is taking place, do not demonstrate increased awareness, skills and access, suggesting that there could be a sizable digital divide. Digital divide and perceivable low digital literacy further exacerbate perceivable socio-economic divide due to geography, gender, background and income.

> 

With Covid-19 pandemic, digitalization accelerated. With increasing digital services traditionally vulnerable groups are further marginalized.   ·   There is a considerate difference between urban and rural connection level. Only 26% of the rural population is covered with mobile connection as of 2017.   ·   There is only 1 desktop computer per every 5 people as of 2017. This number has been stagnant in the past few years.   ·   Whilst 38% of the households with electricity access in Ulaanbaatar were connected to fixed broadband as of 2016, only 7% of the countryside households have broadband access.   ·   Even though there are 122.3 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, out of which 76.8 are smart phone users as of 2017, almost 37% of the mobile users can not benefit from smart and high-tech services.   ·   41% of baby boomers; 64% of generation X; 95% of generation Z uses social network in Mongolia.   ·   Ability to use ICT equipment was evaluated at 32% as of 2020.   ·   Access of ICT equipment for people with disabilities was 3% as of 2020.

·       Given the rapid expansion of E-Mongolia platform, one would expect less demand for government One Stop Service centers. However, as of March 2020, we were able to observe long queue at the One stop service centers, which at the time of COVID is not desirable. During the observation of the queueing people, there is apparent inability to use digital equipment. The government e-service machine is frequently out of order as people press wrong buttons, causing interruption of the machines. It also seemed that people prefer to go to One Stop Service Centers as they obtain more information by talking to each other and finding solutions to their concerns on the spot. While government is making a lot of efforts to digitalize the services, the supporting activities such as more information, clarifications, behavior change aspects are largely being overlooked. ·       Since the inception of the vaccination campaign, the turn out for vaccine shots has been slow. As of April 5, only 22.4% of adult population received their first dose of vaccination. Given the population of 3 million, this rate is relatively slow. We can observe a lot of misinformation going on social media and the older generation, who are more vulnerable to COVID infection, tend to believe them and delay their visit to vaccination clinic. This inability to identify correct and wrong information, protect their information security is a telling sign that the digital literacy is low.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab Mongolia is actively involved in the development of a program of action to improve digital literacy and access. As part of this process, explorations around digital literacy assessment framework, mapping local solutions around improvement of the digital access and experiments to fill in the digital literacy gaps of the marginalized groups will be tested and documented.  We are aiming to provide new insights, using collective intelligence techniques in order to hear stakeholder’s perspectives in a short amount of time and aggregate those ideas to inform strategic planning.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Using collective intelligence and systems thinking, Accelerator Lab Mongolia is assessing the digital divide in Mongolia. We will incorporate grassroots and innovative solutions to close the digital literacy and access gap among the vulnerable Mongolians.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What aspects of digital transformation create the most gap and exclusion when it comes to digitalized public services and support? a.      Governance: How to create more sustainable digital literacy programs? What mechanisms are hindering/supporting a more equitable, accessible digital literacy?  What existing resources that government can leverage to increase digital literacy and access? b.     Users:  Who are the main vulnerable groups who are left behind? What are the bottlenecks? What do they need when it comes to digital literacy and access? What are the best ways to reach out to them? What could be the ways to ensure their digital connectivity and access? What could be other solutions to reach to them, except for platform? c.      Eco system: Who are the main players and stakeholders in the digitalization eco system? How to bring in private sector as part of the solution?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Using these tools we will learn about specific behaviors of target groups when it comes to digital literacy and access. By understanding where and what kind of gap there is, we can develop targeted intervention.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Extensive qualitative study on user groups are not conducted when assessing the baseline digital literacy and access. This new data will enable us to understand human experience of digital services, which will help us design human centered interventions.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are engaging with CITA on this frontier challenge. As part of the program development we will focus on 2-3 experiments, which will provide results on how to proceed further. Using these experiments, we can easily collaborate with CITA to scale the findings nationwide
