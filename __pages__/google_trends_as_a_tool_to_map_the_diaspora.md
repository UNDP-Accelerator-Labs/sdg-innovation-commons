Google search data could give us some insights on the geographic distribution of citizens who live abroad if we carefully and creatively choose the right queries. Google Trends is a publicly available analytical tool that standardizes search volume by language and location over time. It aggregates billions of instances each day in which someone types a query into a search box. It analyses and visualizes most popular queries in time based on region and language. https://www.rs.undp.org/content/serbia/en/home/blog/2020/mo_e-li-google-pretraga-da-pomogne-u-lociranju-dijaspore-.html
