> Title of the innovation

Am agency that diels with issues that affect both girls and boys

> Brief description of the innovation

In the area I stay in  kaoma, it's a small town and people don't know much about childrens rights, girls get married as early as 15 years old or will get impregnated by an old man. For the boys , there is nothing much to do , except alcohol and drugs . Having an agency will help the community to know and understand most of the patterning to good parenting , I have already started but I really need help , and as the old proverb says " the young trees are the future forest , meaning if we take care of the young ones today, we are securering our future.Haveing  a skills college will help a lot and many other things that can help keep the youths busy , this place has no industries hence no employment for the youths ,I would to start up a recycle industry,

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If I open up a recycling company , it won't only creat job opportunities, but it will also help keep the environment clean, and I will be the only one with this kind of business because we get everything from Lusaka which is very expressive when it comes to transport , on retail, if I start this people won't be need to spend lots of money on transport hence makeing more cost saving.

> Technical Feasibility

I would first get land , and then higher people to pick up all kinds of plastic around the environment , and also have a machine that will shape the plastics garbage into different userble things.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People will get jobs and support their families financially , and will also keep the surroundings clean , instead of have blocked drenedg system because of have a lot of plastic west blocking them . It is relevant because no one is doing this in this province , and they have to get everything from Lusaka  , we have market but the supply is low.hence keep the environment clean.
