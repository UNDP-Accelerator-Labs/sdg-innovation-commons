Most villages in rural Pahang still do not have access to electricity and have to rely on oil lamps for light sources. Some issues faced by the villagers include the high energy spending for electricity but a small return, and environmental and health impact by burning palm kernels. A common electricity source used by the villagers is a battery that can only be used for charging at a limited number of times. Global Peace Foundation (GPF) All-Lights Village solar project is a sustainable solution that combines solar technology with clean water solutions, education, income generation, and public-private partnerships to improve the quality of life of the Indigenous People communities. The initiatives taken include building custom houses to preserve their customs and traditions, introduction to committee building with participation from women and youth, and livelihood skills workshops such as on  food farming.
