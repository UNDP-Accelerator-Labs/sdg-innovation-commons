## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Green Transition - Partnership engagement and portfolio activation 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that important transitions that need to happen are not conceived nor implemented on the systemic level, especially in the context of developing countries, therefore stalling the progress and worsening the sustainable development prospects. In the growth/development phase of our work on circularity and climate the Lab is tackling this challenge on multiple planes, including the establishment of a wide collaboration platform for the transition and activating the green transition portfolio of options at a national scale.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Since 2019, the Lab's primary focus has been on the matters of resource use and the energy transition. This exploration and experimentation led to a circular economy portfolio of interventions developed in 2023, which was the subject of an action plan last year. Due to different national and donor-related circumstances, the CE portfolio quickly grew in size and scope and morphed into an extensive Green Transition portfolio with 4 distinct pillars (decarbonisation and climate, waste, nature protection and circular economy). The Lab team is included in the management and governance arrangements as the "portfolio guardian" with one of the tasks to run and support a system learning group (green portfolio engagement platform bringing together all system stakeholders) as a collective power-brain and a system-take on the portfolio implementation. 




> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?







Change hypotheses: By empowering and inspiring people – policymakers, communities, businesses and entrepreneurs, scientists, innovators – and coming together to re-imagine and test new integrated solutions and policies that demonstrate how to switch from fossil fuels to clean energy production and consumption, eliminate waste and pollution, introduce circular business models, protect and replenish natural resources or nurture sustainable lifestyles in society, we will catalyse rapid, simultaneous and system-level effects that propel the green transition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 





> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Green transition issues are large, complex and urgent in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Green transition requires an approach underpinned by systems thinking and coherence beyond mandates and sectors and the Accelerator Lab is connecting the development ecosystem towards this goal.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How do we best engage with and learn from a variety of stakeholders in the green transition arena? Can we aggregate results rather than just scale? How do we build new capabilities for system transformation “from within”? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



There is an ambitious change hypothesis UNDP is brining to the table of options for the green transition in the country, and new value that is unique to this organisation: the Lab which is equipped with new skills to make this change happen. This here selection of innovation methods will be utilised by the lab and our partners to accelerate the transition and learn about how fast and effective it can be done.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The green transition and decarbonisation require a profound change in human behaviour, consumption and production patterns and policy responses. We hope that new sources of data will inform the platform's decisions on how to accelerate this transition in a difficult development context of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



We are already in the growh phase as a significant portion of our work so far lead to this portfolio of development options.
