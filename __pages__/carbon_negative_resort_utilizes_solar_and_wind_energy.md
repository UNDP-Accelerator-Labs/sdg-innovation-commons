Nukubati Resort in Fiji, is a carbon negative resort that utilizes the clean energy produced by 300 solar panels and four wind generators, which can generate over 50 Kilowatts of electricity every day. Other measures the resort has taken to that contributes to their carbon negative status include using treated rainwater, recycling domestic and grey water, sewerage is tertiary treated utilizing natural bio-cycle systems and the sterilized water is then used on the gardens, growing organic vegetables and fruits, and composting all organic waste. The resort does not have any air conditioners installed (buildings are designed to receive ample sea breeze), nor does it have any swimming pools or jacuzzies.
