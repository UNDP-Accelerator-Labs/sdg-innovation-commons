**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

13 March 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Inclusive Growth

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Food security and health

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can smart household gardens improve food security in rural and township communities

Can smart household gardens improve household income in rural and township communities

Can smart household gardens improve quality and quantity of food in agricultural households

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Institute of Natural Resources
## 
****
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can smart household gardens improve food security in rural and township communities

Can smart household gardens improve household income in rural and township communities

Can smart household gardens improve quality and quantity of food in agricultural households

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If smart household gardens are successful then they can improve food security in rural and township communities

If smart household gardens are successful then they can improve household income in rural and township communities

If smart household gardens are successful, then they can improve quality and quantity of food in agricultural households

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Household interviews and tracking before and after smart gardens. 

Observations within community

Pre and post assessment

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

food security

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Household interviews will be conducted before and after smart gardens to gauge food access/security, household income and quality of food. This will be done after a significant amount of time has passed once the gardens are implemented. 

Observations within community - site visits, focus groups, community liaison

Pre and post assessment

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

10 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
