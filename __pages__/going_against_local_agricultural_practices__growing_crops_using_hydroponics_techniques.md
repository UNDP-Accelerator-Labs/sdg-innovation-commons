- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If hydroponics technology is introduced to progressive farmers then gradually farmers can maintain year round farming 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

A simple enclosure was built to create the required environment for this technology to work and seedlings were transplanted into the unit and allowed to grow and compare results against seedlings grown outside the unit. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters measured: Nutrient Solution; Environmental Conditions; Phenological Response; Maintenance Frequency

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Microcontroller to monitor temperature and humidity; Water Quality Tester to collect data on water purity and nutrient solution

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes after displaying the results of  the experiment Government Partners are showing signs of interest in this technology to work towards moving away from season led farming

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I think the 2021 approach I adopted worked well than 2020 experiment having experts in the specific field examine and contribute to the designing of the experiment and having another CO Lab, Bangladesh share their experiences using the same technology and analyse  results.  

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

1200

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Collaboration with Ministry of Youth Affairs and Ministry of Agriculture +innovator we intend to now establish in a hydroponics farming site 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Collaboration with Ministry of Youth Affairs and Ministry of Agriculture  + innovator we intend to now establish in a hydroponics farming site 

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

There a strong business case within the local context

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Internal delays

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Sustainable Local Economic Development Cluster as this team works to promote youth empowerment & employment and fund start-ups with eco friendly solutions

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

partners as there's a strong potential in this technology to contribute to national efforts to making Sierra Leone more food sufficient migrating from traditional routine.

> What surprised you?

That a student innovator can make it work in Sierra Leone for the first time
