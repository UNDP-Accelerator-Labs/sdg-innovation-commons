The First Aid for All Project has emerged to provide a solution to the problem of first aid information deficiency, which is an important public health problem that concerns the entire society. It was designed to carry out studies to realize the importance of first aid, to create a demand for first aid training and to meet this demand with partnerships of private sector, public institutions and NGO's.
