## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Promoting local connections to strengthen social ties and drive community resilience.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to enable connections among people (in 2 neighborhoods in Mexico City) to strengthen local social ties and contribute to a community's recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

To overcome the challenges that the pandemic has created or heightened, governments should invest in the development of capacities, institutions and infrastructure that allow them to better manage the risks and uncertainties in the face of the crises the world is facing. One of these crises is the lack of social contracts and trust. Among the measures to face this crisis, is the investment in social infrastructure to (re)build community resilience and nurture social capital; both aspects are important for the recovery of communities (https://awayforward.undp.org/). Existing research connects social capital to a community’s reaction and recovery capacity in situations of crisis and natural disasters. For example, Daniel P. Aldrich (Northeastern University) has found through his research that social networks—the horizontal and vertical ties that connect us to others—are our most important defense against disasters. This became even more evident with the pandemic.   It was in this context that the previous learning cycle of the Accelerator Lab Mexico was anchored in the challenge that communities with low deposits of social capital tend to struggle the most when collectively responding and recovering from a crisis –in this case, COVID-19. In that cycle, we explored the levels of social capital in Mexico City, identifying areas with low and high deposits of social capital with an index we created. Additionally, we explored the interplay between social capital and the emergence of citizen initiatives to tackle COVID-19.    In our current cycle, we are building upon our previous challenge in order to test ways to enable connections among people to strengthen social ties and contribute to a community’s recovery from crisis. We are focusing in two neighborhoods of Mexico City –one with low social capital and another one with high social capital, according to the index we generated.    We are implementing this learning cycle with our government partner, the General Coordination of Advisors and International Affairs of Mexico City, who want to promote the economic recovery of vulnerable communities through a hyperlocal approach. Intervening in dynamics at a very local level represents a great opportunity for generating learnings for the recovery of communities. The neighborhood, as a social and economic reality, is the smallest unit in the city, so generating transformations within the neighborhoods can favor the linkage of social, environmental and economic issues, which is necessary for articulating a functional city and strengthening communities around sustainability and well-being.

As of April 2021, Mexico City has accumulated 614,400 positive COVID-19 cases (the highest number in the country) and 30,800 deaths since the pandemic started [1]. In terms of the impact of the pandemic in employment, Mexico City concentrates 39.6% of the formal employment lost nationally in 2020 (i.e. 256,145 formal jobs). This is the equivalent to the formal employment generated in the last 3 years [2]. However, there is a high percentage of informality in Mexico; in 2019, more than half of the population were employed in the informal sector (56.5%) [3]. The negative impact of COVID-19 in the country, and in Mexico City in particular, is high; and it demands multiple efforts and strategies to recover from the crisis.   Research in the aftermath of disasters, including the impact of social capital in the recovery of communities, shows that the pre-existence of social ties has a positive impact in the reaction and recovery. An analysis of 130 coastal cities affected by the 60-foot tsunami in Japan in 2011, showed that it was the social infrastructure, not the physical, that best supported the communities [4]. And although, existing research has mostly focused on the relation between social capital and resilience, and disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis, which leave behind material damages, it points towards the importance of such topics for driving recovery processes in the context of the pandemic.    The presence of social ties enables collective action. However, community participation in Mexico is low. On a national level, less than 9% of the population above 15 years old declares that their community gathers frequently to treat issues of common interest (such as, religious events, organize festivities, solve problems related to public services, organize surveillance in the neighborhood, socialize in a public space) [5]. Moreover, the social capital index generated by the Accelerator Lab Mexico in our previous learning cycle showed that out of the 16 boroughs in Mexico City, almost half have very low and low deposits of social capital.   Lastly, one of the governments policies highlights the importance of implementing actions at a hyperlocal context to strengthen communities. They have identified 333 priority vulnerable neighborhoods in Mexico City where they are establishing community centers called PILARES, which stands for Points of Innovation, Freedom, Art, Education and Knowledge [6].

Since the pandemic hit, there have been multiple signals that show the type of efforts or interactions that emerge when people use their social ties. For example, many citizen initiatives –formal and informal– emerged in Mexico City to tackle the situation and provide help (Accelerator Lab Mexico mapped them in our previous learning cycle). Another example is the surge of Facebook and WhatsApp groups to exchange and/or buy products of many sorts. In some cases, these groups include more than 5,000 members. Some of them have a hyperlocal focus and encourage people to consume in their own neighborhoods to help in their recovery (https://www.facebook.com/groups/290863965126258/?ref=share). Moreover, informal advertisements of products and services have populated the exterior of houses and businesses in various neighborhoods (see photos). The exchange or purchase of products or services demand interaction between people.  We see an opportunity in testing ways to promote interactions that can strengthen social ties and increase trust, ultimately benefiting the resilience and recovery of communities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

On one hand, our challenge requires an agile and rapid response to test interventions that can inform the government’s actions to drive the recovery of communities in the context of COVID-19. The Accelerator Lab is equipped to respond in an agile way. This was specifically relevant to our government partner, the General Coordination of Advisors and International Affairs of Mexico City, who wanted to implement a couple of pilots within the span of 3 months to drive the economic recovery of vulnerable communities through a hyperlocal approach.   On the other hand, another added value that AccLab Mexico is bringing to this collaboration our learnings from our previous learning cycle, which was about the role of social capital in crisis recovery. This allowed us to merge the learning interest of the government (economic recovery) with AccLab’s interest (social capital), creating a more holistic point of view for the challenge we are both interested in addressing. The General Coordination invested resources in this learning cycle, as well as the AccLab, because we found a common ground for learning.   Finally, including codesign sessions and rapid prototyping methodologies has proven useful to identify and adjust scaling and adoption opportunities, since the early stages, by one of our government partners (Points of Innovation, Freedom, Art, Education and Knowledge, PILARES centers).

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How might we promote local connections to strengthen social capital and drive community resilience? AccLab Mexico is testing interventions to answer this question and aid in the COVID-19 recovery of communities in Mexico City.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What type of interventions promote more interactions between people within a community and what characteristics should these interactions have to increase trust?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation enables us to design the interventions taking into account the needs and expectations of members of the community and stakeholders. Design sprints are used to create a website for the intervention. Pilots allow us to test the interventions that ensue from the design process. Finally, by using ethnography we will assess the pilots to inform our learning question.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

In a first step, focus groups and direct interviews yield information about the 2 areas of Mexico City where we are piloting interventions, which allows us to identify commonalities and particularities among them in order to inform the design of the interventions. In a second step, this data gives us information about the impact of the interventions and areas of improvement for future iterations. Finally, tracking data refers to Google Analytics, which will allow us to assess the usage of the website we are piloting.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

In what ways might we overcome the challenges and leverage the opportunities that stem from piloting interventions that seek to promote interactions among people in the COVID-19 context of physical distancing?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation with stakeholders enables us to design the interventions taking into account the constraints of COVID-19 and physical distancing. Pilots allow us to test if the interventions helped to overcome such constraints. Finally, by using ethnography we will assess the pilots to generate recommendations for future improvement.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

In a first step, focus groups and direct interviews yield information about how to design and implement interventions in the context of COVID-19. In a second step, this data gives us information about the impact of the interventions and areas of improvement for future iterations.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we facilitate the transfer and appropriation of the pilots to PILARES (Points of Innovation, Freedom, Art, Education and Knowledge), our local government partner?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation enables us to include PILARES personnel in the design of the interventions, resulting in interventions that are relevant for them and that incorporate their point of view. Ethnography helps us to identify the needs of PILARES and the expectations they have for the pilots, as well as the steps we should follow in order to facilitate their transfer and adoption. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Focus groups and direct interviews produce information for designing relevant interventions for PILARES, as well as a strategy for promoting the adoption and transfer of the pilots for the grow stage.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We have 2 key champions for the grow phase:

(1) The General Coordination of Advisors and International Affairs (CGAAI) of Mexico City, who can leverage their relationship with multiple government ministries to promote the adoption and scalability of the pilots. Additionally, they can leverage their relationship with international organizations and private sector to seek out finance for the grow phase.

(2) PILARES (Points of Innovation, Freedom, Art, Education and Knowledge), who can adopt the pilots in the 2 areas of Mexico City where they are working and scale them to other areas. PILARES are key for the continuation of the pilots in the communities.

Finally, the inhabitants of the communities where we are working and the users of PILARES can benefit from this work.
