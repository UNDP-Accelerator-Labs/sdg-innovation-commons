AMC-1 Reaper | Drone for Precision Agriculture

> Brief description of the innovation

Agriculture is one of the most crucial elements for the sustainability of human civilization. It has been forecast that agricultural consumption would increase by 69% from 2010 to 2050 due to increase in population. The current technological trends in agricultural practices are not suitable for small land holdings that are a norm in developing countries like Zambia.

 As such, meeting future food demands seems like an uphill task for such countries. To stay sustainable, maximize productivity and optimize land spaces, the concepts of advanced farming techniques need to be explored and integrated into agriculture. One such concept is drones with data-gathering equipment for agriculture which is now known as precision agriculture.

In supporting precision farming, the AMC-1 Reaper drone has a wide range of functions from soil and crop field analysis to pesticide spraying. It can do soil health scans, monitor crop health, assist in planning irrigation schedules, apply fertilizers, estimate yield data and provide valuable data for weather analysis. It uses different imaging technologies like hyperspectral, multispectral and thermal that can provide the farmers with time and site-specific information regarding crop health, fungal infections, growth bottlenecks etc.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will play an important role in precision farming, helping agriculture professionals lead the way with sustainable farming practices, while also protecting and increasing profitability.

Given the extensive terrain that requires surveying, AMC-1 offer increased efficiency, allowing famers to capture high-resolution imagery more quickly than alternative methods. Particularly in these volatile market conditions, estimating annual yield can help guide decision-making and manage expectations.

The challenge price will help me grow a business by making it possible to buy the aircraft drone components and get them assembled locally, and also employ others to improve on the software trying to make it an effective approach to sustainable agricultural management that allows farmers to help streamline their operations, using robust data analytics to gain effective insights into their crops.

Farming can have an impact on the environment, given the industry’s reliance on natural resources, the use of drones has been something of a revolution for many, and it is rapidly changing the way farmers operate, the opportunities for cost savings and environmental improvements make it a serious proposition, rather than using tractors and quad bikes, which use petrol and produce harmful emissions, farmers will be turning to drones, which use clean electricity.

> Technical Feasibility

AMC-1 Reaper is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), a quadcopter equipped with various sensors for crop health monitoring, soil analysis, detection of fungal infestation and more, GPS for mapping of yield and crop parameter data within fields and more.

With the Software prototype in simulation testing stage showing over 40% success rate, the following are the features of the AMC-1 Reaper drone…

1. Soil and field analysis: it produces precise 3-D maps for early soil analysis, useful in planning seed planting patterns.

2. Crop spraying: equipped light-detection and ranging, or LiDAR, it can adjust altitude as the topography and geography vary, and thus avoid collisions, it also can scan the ground and spray the correct amount of liquid.

3. Crop monitoring: it provides satellite imagery that offer the most advanced form of crop or livestock monitoring.

4. Irrigation: with the thermal sensors on board, it can identify which parts of a field are dry or need improvements.

5. Health assessment: it’s equipped with a sensor that can identify which plants reflect different amounts of green light and NIR light by scanning a crop using both visible and near-infrared light

> Anticipated Social Impact

The AMC-1 Reaper is an emerging innovation in crop technology that will help to improve agriculture and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals as a result.

The AMC-1 Reaper will change the way farmers manage crops to ensure efficiency of inputs such as water and fertilizer, and it will also maximize productivity, quality, and yield and also minimizing pests, unwanted flooding, and disease. It will allow farmers to constantly monitor crop and livestock conditions by air to quickly find problems that would not become apparent in ground-level spot checks. For example, a farmer might find through time-lapse AMC-1 Reaper drone photography that part of his or her crop is not being properly irrigated.

Compared to the more traditional time and labor-intensive type of farming the AMC-1 Reaper will revolutionize agriculture by offering farmers major cost savings, enhanced efficiency, and more profitability. By quickly surveying vast stretches of farmland, it can map the property, report on crop health, improve spraying accuracy, monitor livestock and irrigation systems, and more. The ability to collect and analyze this data in real time has tangible outcomes for farmers such as better crop yield, fewer resources expended on weeds and herbicides, and overall improved management decisions.
