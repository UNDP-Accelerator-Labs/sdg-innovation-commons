## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Demonstrate Seating Benches Made of Plastic Waste in Public Space
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that if we demonstrate the use of products made from waste in public space, it will raise awareness among people to manage their waste.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

With the growing urbanization and uncertainties, the global crisis and development challenges are ever increasing. In order to tackle these current challenges and reimagine development for the 21st century, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has launched “UNDP Accelerator Lab”. In Nepal, the Accelerator Lab is focusing on two frontier challenges - Youth Unemployment and Unplanned Urbanization. With COVID 19, effects of these challenges have exponentially increased, with urgent needs of actions.

Among the various challenges, the issue of solid waste management is critical in cities and mountain regions due to lack of recycling and upcycling mechanisms. Most of the waste collected are either openly dumped or burnt without proper management. While exploring the existing practices, UNDP has come across with different waste enterprises working on upcycling businesses, most of which are either in nascent stages or are facing difficulties on creating larger and sustainable market.

On the other hand, we have been observing thousands of youths migrating abroad every day for better education and employment opportunities. As per the latest data for 2021, the overall unemployment rate of Nepal was 5.05%, a 0.33% increase from 2020, while youth unemployment rate being 9.50%, a 1.41% increase from 2020. We have also observed youths interested in developing their creative ideas into innovative enterprises and initiating start-ups to test viability of commercialization in terms of waste enterprises. This is the area where UNDP Accelerator Lab has been promoting green jobs, local waste enterprises and start-ups to minimize waste and create livelihood opportunities through circular economy.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Among the various innovative options on transferring waste to resourceful materials, it was found that the benches made from waste plastics are more cost effective and highly durable. In this context, UNDP Accelerator Lab in Nepal is planning to demonstrate this explored option at one of the parks or public open spaces within the Kathmandu Valley to encourage public about the wise use of waste materials and enhance their knowledge and awareness.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Imagine the unimaginable of transferring waste into sturdy benches!

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we aware public on the use of waste to usable products and encourage then on proper management of waste?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation: the products will be designed and co-created together with the enterprises

Prototyping: the designed products will then be prototyped and demonstrated at one of the government allocated public space 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Since these are newly explored products in the context of Nepal, there are not much data and information available. Hence participatory and collective approaches and surveys will be essential to have primary validation on the products and the effect on changing the behavior of the people
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The intervention supported on creating enabling environment for upcycled products. This intervention engaged Lalitpur Metropolitan City (local government), 2 waste enterprises (Blue Waste to Value and Kleanit Upcyclers Private Limited) and community to prototype and promote 22 benches made of plastic waste, diverting 2 tons of plastics from landfill within 2 months and creating revenue equivalent to NPR 200,000 per month for the waste enterprises.
