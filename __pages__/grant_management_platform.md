Grant Management Platform
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that although the CO has been conducting many grant programs for many years, the data of those programs have not been compiled so that the impact reporting of the grant programs was never been made in that manner. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The CO has been implementing and will continue to implement many different grant programmes in different portfolios and it is still expected that more grant programmes are in the pipeline. Until now, most of them have been conducted through email correspondence including SGP. Civic Engagement Project will be conducting a Grant Programme for CSOs with a total budget of 3.5 million USD for projects that are designed to be implemented in partnership with a municipality. The program will be launched in September 2023 and since there will be many applications expected, there is a need for a software to be designed for the needs of the Project and eventually the CO.




> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Since Civic Engagement Project will be conducting a Grant Programme for CSOs with a total budget of 3.5 million USD for projects that are designed to be implemented in partnership with a municipality, this experiment is first urgent since the programm is planned to start in september 2023, second very important because the budget is big and if the test succeeds it will be a model for other grant programs in the CO.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Meetings with grant program managers in the CO were held to try to understand the weaknesses of lacking of a software that can start with the applications, continue with managing the grants and end with reporting. Email correpondences can lead to many errors and missing of data.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



AccLab will first find a software that is capable of providing the requested services. AccLab will also configure the available software for UNDP and project needs. The objective to have a software to be used for all grant programmes in UNDP  - will help to ease the process for project staff that can contribute to efficiency of the staff,  
- will enable data integration so that different grant programs' data can be collected and integrated into a single holistic report. 
- can minimize these errors by automating data collection, calculations, and validations. 
- can provide real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities, allowing the organization to have up-to-date information on project progress, achievements, and challenges. 
- can generate comprehensive reports and data visualizations, making it easier to analyze project outcomes, impact, and lessons learned.
Overall, it is expected that a software for managing and reporting on development projects and grants can significantly enhance the efficiency, accuracy, transparency, and measuring the impact of the CO's grant management activities and contribute to SDG reporting. This program will be tested in civic engagement project but it is expected that other grant programmes will also be managed with this software in the future so that the overall efficiency of grant management in CO will increase.




> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

After making a comprehensive market research and also evaluating the option of developing a stand alone software for UNDP, it was decided that the Enquire software that belongs to Tactiv company answers all the needs of CO in terms of grant management. There will be a procurement of annual usage of the platform but the company together with AccLab will configure the system for UNDP needs especially in terms of impact reporting.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What is the need of the portfolios in the CO to better manage grants? Is it possible to make reporting of these grant programs compiled in one platform? Will using a software configured for CO needs increase the efficiency of the staff?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



AccLab will pilot the software that they designed together with the software provider in one of the grant schemes in CO. If it succeeds then it will be introduced to all portfolios and anyone will be able to use the same software for the upcoming grant programs.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



It was asked to global ICT office whether UNDP has a corporate grant management tool. The grant managers were interviewed. There is a need to learn the UNDP s impact reporting needs to better configure the new pilot system.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



AccLab will pilot the software that they designed together with the software provider in one of the grant schemes in CO. If it succeeds then it will be introduced to all portfolios and anyone will be able to use the same software for the upcoming grant programs.
