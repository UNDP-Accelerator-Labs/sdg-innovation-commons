## Overall goal

Monitor the presence of an invasive alien species (IAS) in Argentina, the red-bellied squirrel Callosciurus erythraeus. 
## Specific goals

Update this species distribution and compare it with previous studies to evaluate its expansion. 

Understand the invasion process of an IAS. 

Identify priority areas to provide environmental education, and implement prevention measures, or other handling techniques for the species. 

Popularize the importance of citizen responsibility and engagement in the knowledge, information dissemination, and prevention of biological invasions, its relation to the ownership of exotic pets, and the illegal trade of introduced wild species. 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens participate in reporting squirrel sightings, indicating their location as precisely as possible, and, optionally, sharing photos of squirrels or any evidence showing they are at a site (nests, eaten fruit, or bark stripping). Records must be uploaded to the digital platform ArgentiNat from a computer or to the app INaturalist using a mobile phone.
