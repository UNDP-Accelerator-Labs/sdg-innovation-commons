## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Community waste management system
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that only 30% of household is contracted to city waste collection and that people sees waste as a burden

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The lack of awareness raising on waste management and segregation, the lack of efficient waste collection and treatment, the unequal access to waste collection network and the high waste collection fee contribute to the fact that only 30% of household in Vientiane Capital is contracted to waste collection service. At the same time, open burning and public littering are still common. Resulting on health issues, pollution issue and tarnish the image of the city. Recently the only landfill of the city burnt and create a toxic 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

We know that the only landfill to stock the waste is full and that is a source hazardous air pollution as it has partly burnt 2 times in the part 5 years (2018 and 2022). We see the urgency to reduce waste and segregate waste to reduce open burning and improved the quality of living of the community. From the Air quality station at the UN-House in 2021 ,165 days in a year, the air quality were unhealthy to sensitive population and 100 days in a year, the air quality were unhealthy to everyone.

VCOMS, the local authorities that manage the collection of the waste is unfunded and under-equipped to reach 100% of the households. VCOMS recently received electrical collection trucks from development partners to increase their reach but limited actions are done to increase the interest of the communities to properly manage their waste or to reduce the waste that ends up at the sub-standard landfill or littered.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

While other stakeholders are working on improved the waste treatment facility and the waste collection reach, the Accelerator Lab has the network experience of working with the community to propose a new community waste management system based on the indigenous knowledge (ethnography study) and existing urban fabric and usage, and available local solutions to buy recycled waste and product to generate biogas and liquid fertilizer from organic waste. The Lab is best position to carry this experimentation thanks to previous mapping of this issue and good understanding of the stakeholders  and thanks to the experience from the Accelerator Lab network, especially from Vietnam (design of waste bin) and The Philippines (Ethnography study).

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP Accelerator Lab working with the community to define a sustainable circular waste management system transforming waste to wealth through human centered design waste bin and biogas system.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Is behavioral change possible with the introduction of a profitable, efficient and community-organized waste management system

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnography scanning to identify key persons within the community to be involved in the experimentation Human Centered Design to co-create a waste bin that are easy to use for the community to segregate recyclable waste Smart Cities technology with sensor and products that innovate the way of practive System thinking by tackling different component of the existing/failing system to change the system.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The experimentation above will create new source of measurable data that can contribute to quantify the impact (kg of waste recycle, kg of organic waste composted, income generated from sells)
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

major risk related to the reluctence from the community to engage to the system change experimentation
