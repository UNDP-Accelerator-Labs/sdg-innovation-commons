> Brief description of the innovation

A Low-Cost Ventilator is a machine that act as bellows to move air in and out of a patient's lungs. The respiratory therapist and doctor set the ventilator to control how often it pushes air into a patient's lungs and how much air they get.

A patient may  be fitted with a mask to get air from the ventilator into their lungs. Or they may need a breathing tube if their breathing problem is more serious.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The low-cost ventilator machine, will take over the huge and expensive mechanical ventilators which most developing countries are unable to purchase and equip their hospitals to combat COVID-19. 
Therefore, by introducing the low-cost ventilator machines, many countries will adopt and purchase the low-cost ventilator because they are affordable, portable, and easy to maintain. This will generate income for me and many youths who will be empowered in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of the low-cost ventilators.
The low-cost ventilators will mainly be used in hospitals and in transport systems such as ambulances and MEDEVAC air transport etc. In some cases, they can be used at home, if the illness is long term and the caregivers at home receive training and have adequate nursing and other resources in the home. 
The challenge prize will help establish a manufacturing company and grow the business because the product will be produced locally. This will increasingly help fight the spread of COVID-19 locally and globally.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation design provides a compact system design capable of supporting motor acceleration and deceleration up to ±200 kRPM/s, which is a key requirement in many ventilator/respirator applications. The design supports a number of offboard C2000 controllers including the TMS320F28027F, enabling a low-cost, sensor-less field oriented control (FOC). In addition, the design supports a wide input voltage range (6-28 V) capable of supporting both regulated line and battery power. To drive the air blower and valves, this design uses the DRV8323RS smart gate driver and DRV8847 motor driver, respectively.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Specific to the present COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate the following scenarios in which a low-cost ventilator could be safely used to provide respiratory support:

A deteriorating COVID-19 patient, who is short of breath &amp; hypoxic; hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency means they are not breathing well enough to adequately oxygenate their blood. Clinicians at this point can initiate respiratory support.

Ventilated patients required to leave the ICU for imaging or procedures can be supported with the low-cost ventilator, unless determined that the patient requires support outside its range.
A multidisciplinary team consisting of a physician, critical care nurse, and respiratory therapist should be available to monitor ventilated patients at all times. Additionally, a clinical lab capable of timely reporting of blood gases and other common ICU laboratory markers should be available to enable the clinical team to make appropriate decisions and adjustments.
