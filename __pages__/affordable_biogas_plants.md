> Description of the solution

To facilitate clean cooking, Grameen Shakti is a social enterprise that introduced its Biogas Program in 2005 offering the installment of plants that turn organic waste into biogas. Biogas is therefore a clean cooking fuel, the residue can be used as a high-quality fertilizer and it reduces pollution. Biogas is a popular solution in rural areas due to the low cost of set-up and the abundance of organic waste materials.  So far, the company has installed more than 36,000 biogas plants all over Bangladesh. Grameen Shakti offers a hybrid payment model that incorporates features of microfinance and an in-house credit model, resulting in a more affordable biogas plant.
