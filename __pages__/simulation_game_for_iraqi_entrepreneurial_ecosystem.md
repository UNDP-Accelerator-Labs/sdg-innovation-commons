Many actors in the business ecosystem are not aware of the role and interests of other stakeholders, especially young people seeking support to start their own business. On the other hand, traditional training methods addressing the local business ecosystem are limited and not very effective. 
What?
The Simulation Game is designed to be a training tool to enhance the understanding of the business ecosystem in Iraq. it can be used as standalone training activity or as supporting tool to workshops addressing business or entrepreneurship. 
How?
It is a fun way of role-play that would let each participant play a role in the ecosystem and interact with other stakeholders based on the interests of their party. The more the engage and achieve the objectives of the character they are playing, the more points and cash they gain in the simulation game. 
Who?
The game is designed mainly for young people willing to learn more about how to interact with the stakeholders of the ecosystem to start their own business. However, the cam can be played by other stakeholders such as government and companies (especially those mandated to support youth projects). Also, this game can be used as a tool to mix young individuals and institutions to build common ground and enhance communication.
