Knowledge Transfer Africa is an agriculture knowledge hub. Its flagship initiative is known as eMkambo – is an interactive mobile and web-based platform for agriculture that collects market information from 10 provinces in Zimbabwe through its network of contributors. This information is shared with various stakeholders in the food supply chain and reports generated inform development work in the agricultural sector.
