> Title of the innovation

Community Television and Tourism for education and entertainment in local communities

> Brief description of the innovation

After a good research to set up a viable business which can thrive in Zambia, we concluded that the majority people lack information and entertainment; hence their economic growth rate is very minimal. People lack facilities to help them reach a high level of economic development. The exposure to the daily fluctuations of our local currency is very low which makes them unable to clearly define the price mechanisms of various commodities and services. Therefore, the directors of this project of Kuyema television station are passionate about informing, educating and innovating the youths in the catchment area of either rufunsa, luangwa-feira or Zambezi district. The role the station will play will be defined by the viewers' need for information, innovation and access to modern technological and material resources which are essential for development in rural and peri-urban regions. The project seeks to serve the local communities with ethical content which will gain the admiration and support of the viewers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

To generate income, this project seeks to concentrate much on the top ten industries and businesses that actively purchase airspace for advertising and promotion of their goods and services. This will reduce the cost of doing business and increase the profits. Our target market is composed of 3 main groups; high growth sectors like individuals, families and industries, independent artists and performers. This project will help keep the youths and communities informed on various issues surrounding the nation and will reduce the illiteracy levels in the rural catchment areas.

> Technical Feasibility

After a good research, we concluded that this business can be well sustained by diversifying in the hospitality industry and promotion of community tourism. The project will implement its operations in phases and will partner with major news agencies and media houses like ZANIS and those in the print media, also the ministries responsible for local tourism and art.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The role the station will play in the improvement of the lives of the youths will be to inform, and educate them and also give them exposure to the world around them so that they can improve on their living standards as well as household income. This station will serve the community with ethical content which will be fr the admiration and support of the viewers. It will seek to increase the advertising budget and mix local news content and sport.
