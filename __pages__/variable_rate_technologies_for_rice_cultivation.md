In the rice production sector, the seed application system is used to provide data which has been collected through sensors and satellites on land levels (like the surface of land) where seeds are planted. This is helpful as there are differences in land levels which can affect the quality and quantity of rice produced.    By using a farming software to identify the conditions and land levels of each land area, farmers can identify and calculate the optimum amount of seeds needed to be planted on an uneven ground to produce just as many germinated seeds as on even land areas. This enables optimum planting of paddy plant.  Another important step for an optimum harvest is the nurturing process, which is related to how paddy plants are fertilised. Data about soil fertility from the fertiliser application system can help farmers and other users make more informed decisions on the amount of fertiliser required at a given area.   The application of variable rate technologies can save labour costs up to 50% and reduce the use of chemical fertilisers by 25%, limiting its impact on the environment.
