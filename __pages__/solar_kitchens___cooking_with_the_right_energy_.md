> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Solar Kitchens - Cooking with the right energy!
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



UNDP has been facing challenges with resource mobilization. Traditional donor environment is saturated and new alternatives need to be explored. Angola CO is launching it's first Crowdfunding Campaign to support energy access and food processing in rural areas.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Development sector is facing challenges in financing. Traditional donor ecosystem and bilateral funds are difficult to tap into and new alternatives should be explored. The Angola CO is hoping to scale-up an initiative previously piloted in the provinces of Huíla and Benguela using internal TRAC 2 funds which is the installation of solar kitchens in rural areas. This model of kitchens allows communities to process agriculture products and increase their income. To enable this the CO is using Crowdfunding to establish new kitchens.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

No specific evidence to include. However, many articles about the difficulties in resource mobilization within the UN system have been written. Population with access to electricity is below 30% and remains below 10% in rural areas. 83% of the rural villages do not have any sourceof electricity. Low literacy level in rural area 41,1% and capacity building in modern techniques for transforming agricultural products.

## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



If the experiment and pilot works as expected, the CO is already thinking of other campaigns to be launched either for scaling-up to more solar kitchens or another campaign already pre-designed for another challenge. We are counting on our partners to keep supporting in the growth stage and we will also expand the partners network and increase local government engagement.
