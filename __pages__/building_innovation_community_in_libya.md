Our challenge is connecting the innovation community in Libya to work on many challenges facing the country.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We intend to build an innovation community that can help AccLab in tackling challenges, identify the innovation gap, promote the Lab methods seek solutions that can be scaled up.
