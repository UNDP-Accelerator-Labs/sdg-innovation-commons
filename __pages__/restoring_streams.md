> Type of the Solution

Innovative

> Description of the solution

In Seoul, South Korea, an effort was done to restore the Cheonggyecheon stream that runs through the city and the community replaced the 5.8 km of elevated expressway covering the stream with a mixed-use waterfront corridor. The waterfront corridor reduces the urban heat island effect with temperatures along the stream 3.3¬∞ to 5.9¬∞C cooler than on a parallel road 4-7 blocks away.
