## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Javier Brolo and María Inés Castañeda



> On date (Day/Month/Year)

June 12th, 2021



> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Knowledge management



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to base decisions and behaviors on existing knowledge



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What makes it easier for decisions and behaviors to be informed by existing knowledge?



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

UNDP, Centro de Voluntariado Guatemalteco (CVG)


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn how to transfer the capacity to map solutions to volunteer organizations, and what are the needs being attended by solutions mapped by members of these volunteer organizations.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we share solution mapping methods to volunteer organizations, then we will be able to learn faster what are the development needs and how they are being attended at the local level



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We conducted a workshop with volunteer organizations in which we addressed the following topics: what is an innovation; what are UNDP's principles for accelerating development; the importance of addressing cognitive biases; what is solution ion mapping; and how a "solution" provides information about a need and how the world works. One of the highlighted exercises included showing a picture of children painting a mural, and asking what the solution was, what challenge was it addressing, and why it was effective. Then, we asked participants to conduct a solution mapping exercise in their neighborhoods and share the results.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each participant in the workshop



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We collected data using a shared document and a solution mapping template. This was citizen generated data which they collected by direct observation in the field. 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

About a week.



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

We conducted this training workshop remotely. We needed computers, internet access, a videoconference app, we use Mural for sharing the contents and activities, we use google for creating shared documents, we needed two facilitators, and the coordination to invite participants. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven (with exceptions)



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We did not have a comparison group, only compared before and after. However, we were testing to see if an approach was viable and capable of yielding results, rather than measuring the size of impact. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

About a week.



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00 additional costs. 



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This exercise was followed with another one to transfer capacity to identify week signals of change. 



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We were aiming to scale transfer of capacity within the organizations and other institutions.



> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment led to partnerships
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We have learned that the workshop materials used were able to increase the capacity of participants to map solutions. In particular, the exercise showing the picture of a mural was an effective way that solutions can be interpreted depending on different views of the world. Through the practice of the exercise, we learned that some needs about participants included waste, nutrition, reforestation, providing shelter, organizing the community, reducing inequalities, providing energy, among many others.



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

We needed to overcome the challenge of transferring capacity in a virtual environment. We still have the challenge of making this a sustained effort. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All the programmatic areas would benefit in understanding from the perspective of people, what are the needs that people are trying to address and what is possible to do with available resources and capacity to build from it.



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Also, UNDP's counterparts will

benefit from this increase capacity to sense, and to incorporate citizen

science in the effort of learning what is already working. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We only had one shot to conduct the workshop, although iterations can help improve the knowledge sharing



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Focus on encouraging deeper insights. Prompt the explanation of solutions asking what the need is being solved, and why do we think the solution is adequate to solve the problem. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This solution is a methodology that can be applied to any SDG, although is particularly useful for SDG's linked to social challenges such as reduce poverty, inequality, health, and less applicable to challenges such as production of goods. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense has defined the methodologies used in the workshops. 



> What surprised you?

It's surprising that solutions are multidimensional, due to the needs found, like poverty, inequalities, health, among many others.
