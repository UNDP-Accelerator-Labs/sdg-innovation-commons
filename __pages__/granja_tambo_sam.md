> Description

Pork and beef products, in addition to those derived from milk, are the main pillars of the initiative. But it also includes the elaboration of products (preserves, syrups, polished fruits) with what the garden generates, which is for self-consumption (and raises the quality of the nutrition of the children of the family) and allows the sale of the surplus (lettuce, chard) on a small scale.
