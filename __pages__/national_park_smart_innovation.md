National Park Smart Innovation

> Brief description of the innovation

National park smart innovation is a connected system of information which can help park employees perform many of their daily tasks more efficiently. For instance, using apps such as Smart Earth Network, in which travelers can share data and log, for example, animal sightings or discoveries of invasive species, park rangers would be able to monitor animals and make sure vulnerable species are protected.
This innovation can offer campers and visitors life-saving information, such as real-time alerts about severe weather developments in their area.
