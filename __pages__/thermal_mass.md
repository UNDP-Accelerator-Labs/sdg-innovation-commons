> Description of the solution

In building design, thermal mass is a property of the mass of a building that enables it to store heat and provide inertia against temperature fluctuations. It is sometimes known as the thermal flywheel effect. It can be used to even out variations in internal and external conditions, absorbing heat as temperatures rise and releasing it as they fall. An example is a trombe wall placed in front of a south-facing window will absorb solar radiation and then slowly release it into the enclosed space.
