## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Women's financial inclusion laboratory
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that women in Bolivia do not have similar access and use of financial services. While banks have rules and requeriments that could represent barriers for women's financial inclusion, startups and SMES could improve chances for women to financial inclusion through digital and other innovative services. We want to explore that fact.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Eventhough digital finance services widened opportunities to access and use financial products, women's financial inclusion is still a challenge, especially for vulnerable groups and entrepreneurs. In a previous learning process we learnt about women's personal, familiar and business barriers to access to finance. We also discovered that it is also necessary to explore gender approach of institutions that could improve financial inclusión because If these institutions (like new startups) do not consider women's financial inclusion, they could widen the gender gap  

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to a studio led by UN WOMEN in Bolivia (2021) only 20% of women access to finance and there is a 36 point-gender gap. Besides, only 30% of saving accounts are women's accounts. Regarding to the loans the gender gap can raise to 47% in big loans. Only communal bank (a kind of microfinancing) has a high participation of women, but interest are the highest ones of the financial ecosystem.  For the side of startups, there are 20 startups mapped fintech according to the TIC Mapping in Bolivia  (2022) that could help for women's financial inclusion.
