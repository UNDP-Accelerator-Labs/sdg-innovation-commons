Our biodegradable bags are made by a unique, technical process which combines a renewable resource - cassava starch - with a fossil fuel. When disposed of, the starch degrades naturally within just a few months and produces bacteria which begins to directly attack the fossil polymer chains, drastically reducing degradation from hundreds of years to about 5 years.
