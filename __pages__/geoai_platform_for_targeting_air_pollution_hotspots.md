## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.More than 47000 brick kilns that are hotspots of air pollution and vulnerable labor are mapped across Indo-gangetic plains. Accurate geo-coordinates of these industries are provided by this platform from space and with open-access. Creating accurate geo-intelligence for the first time in India.   2.Brick kilns are classified into environmentally complaint and non-complaint ones using AI. AI algorithms detected 46% non-compliant brick kilns in Bihar and 96% non-compliance in Odisha.   3.THREE state regulatory agencies have adopted this technology – Bihar State Pollution Control Board, Odisha State Pollution Control Board, Chhattisgarh Labor Department. They have co-invested to implement this platform by conducting field inspections across states using GeoAI platform.         (After field inspections, the regulatory agencies will issue closure notices to non-compliant brick kilns.)   4. UNDP Accelerator Lab relied on citizen science efforts from digital volunteers  to generate  training and validation data for AI algorithms in order to   improve their accuracy. The volunteers were sourced via the United Nations Volunteers online network called VFORCE. Each volunteer was given target to classify 250-300 satellite images. With active participation of officials from BSPCB and the University of Nottingham, the volunteers were trained on identifying specific features of brick kilns for segregation as compliant and non-compliant. With active facilitation and training, volunteers as young as 13 years were able to classify more than 2500 kilns within a week. The citizen science data was fed into GeoAI platform for large scale classification of brick kilns across Bihar.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There were delays in ground truthing of data through field inspections due to COVID. This time was instead utilised by the team to train the Pollution control board officials to use the platform

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

 By generating targeted geo-intelligence (generated through satellite data, machine learning and citizen science), we are tackling challenges faced by environmental regulators to address large number of sources of air pollution spread across India.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We have used both structured and unstructured data coming in from sensors, surveys, satellite data, and mobile data, socioeconomic data, administrative data, and open data across our portfolio of solutions. We have also created data partnerships and collaboratives to tap into some of the data sources.  We are adding lot of new value to the air pollution sector and providing new intelligence through some of these alternative, unconventional datasets.   The GeoAI platform demonstrated how environmental non-compliance can be detected from space using artificial intelligence. It significantly reduces the humongous task and investments required to regulate each and every industrial unit in India. For instance, the challenge of monitoring about 8,000 brick kilns in Bihar was brought down to less than 4,000. It is a novel approach for improving regulatory governance in India. The GeoAI platform brings together coordinated action from diverse stakeholders – regulators, government agencies, civil society, and volunteer groups to tackle the complexity around brick kilns.
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Technical collaboration & data partnership for GeoAI platform: The research paper ‘Slavery from Space’  from the Rights Lab, University of Nottingham showcased a novel approach of using geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence to detect the exact locations of brick kilns using satellite imagery. After the research identified 47,000 precise locations of brick kilns, we connected with the University and now have a technical and data collaboration.  AccLab has repurposed their research for air pollution and extended the research to classify brick kilns based on the environmental (non) compliance using AI algorithms and citizen science. This data is now part of the back-end of our technology platform (app+web-based) which is now being used by state environmental regulators for state wide implementation.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We are partnering with Bihar State Pollution Control Board to roll out the GeoAI platform in their state. This agency is the key environment regulator for monitoring air pollution in the state of Bihar https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/mou-inked-to-check-pollution-through-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/80773918.cms
