## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Preventing and responding to gender-based violence and femicides  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that violence against women and girls lacks justice and repair policies and practices. Families are revictimized by the judicial system and only 37% of judicialized cases have received sentence. Families have remained unheard, dealing with their loss on their own and looking for own social justice.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Historically, GBV and femicides are high and continuously increasing in Ecuador, with underreported data that fails to capture the extent of the problem as well as a slow and inefficient judicial system. Ecuador, like the rest of the world, suffered the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, which stressed inequalities, setting women as the most affected population. Violence against women, already high before the pandemic, has dramatically increased, while women have been restricted to co-exist with their aggressors at an unprecedented scale, limiting their options to seek aid and support.  Caregiving, the arrangements of daily life in isolation and the aggressor’s presence can increase tensions, conflicts and physical or psychological violence against women. In 2020, according to official data, the number of women victims of intentional homicide was 164, of which 78 were classified as femicides, the highest number since 2017. As for the justice system, only 37% of cases have been prosecuted since 2014. The rest of the causes are still under investigation, others have been shelved, criminal action prescribed, the defendants were dismissed or declared innocent. This leaves families and communities in search of social justice on their own. Grieving and mourning needs also justice.

Due to the considerable sub-registry of femicides in Ecuador, CSO’s and feminist grassroots organizations play a key role in raising awareness and keeping track of non-reported femicides as well as cases officially classified as violent deaths. In 2017, the Alliance for the Monitoring and Mapping of Femicides was founded, where official data is complemented with CSO information, shelter data and information from the media, becoming the most cited national source on femicide.  CSO’s have compiled a list of support services for GBV during the pandemic and have set a communication strategy to reach more women. The Human Rights Secretariat, the Government’s institution that heads GBV prevention and response policies is concerned with the current situation and has been working closely with the National Police to facilitate GBV reporting, including escorting services for victims. To address these issues, UNFPA, UN Women and UNDP have launched the EU-funded “Spotlight” initiative in 2021, which the Accelerator Lab will support.  http://www.fundacionaldea.org/noticias-aldea/a3kb8defsspm69swg7ft3el2pxjy2b   https://www.ethnodata.org/es-es/salas-1/  Data treats feminicides as numbers and there´´ is little qualitative data that narrates the consequences of feminicides on families and communities, the barriers to proper grieving due to lack of justice. No data talks about impunitiy and alternative forms of social justice. For this reason, social cartography will be used with families, victims of feminicides, who they, themselves, will be providing inputs to OSM, to track memory of the victim, social justice mechanisms, and injustice routes.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Accelerator Lab brings in fresh innovative tools and perspectives that haven’t been applied before to address GBV. We will add value by employing social cartography as a memorial tool to remember femicide victims. It is the families themselves who will take ownership of the tool, walk together, remember their victims, trace memorial routes on OSM, make paths of injustice visible and identify alternative social justice mechanisms that respond to impunity. While collecting data, families are actually participating in a repair process and accessing to a platform of visibility and voice amplification.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Situated action: family victims of feminicide in Ecuador employ social cartography to build memory, show the paths of injustice and identify alternative social justice mechanisms that they have invented to break impunity.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the routes of injustice that families face in their feminicide cases? What alternatives of social justice do communities create? What contributions do they bring? Can social cartography as a memorial tool for femicide secondary victims contribute to GBV repair families and communities?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

It is the families themselves who will take ownership of the tool, walk together, remember their victims, trace memorial routes on OSM, make paths of injustice visible and identify alternative social justice mechanisms that respond to impunity. While collecting data, families are actually participating in a repair process and accessing to a platform of visibility and voice amplification.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data treats feminicides as numbers and there´´ is little qualitative data that narrates the consequences of feminicides on families and communities, the barriers to proper grieving due to lack of justice. No data talks about impunitiy and alternative forms of social justice. For this reason, social cartography will be used with families, victims of feminicides, who they, themselves, will be providing inputs to OSM, to track memory of the victim, social justice mechanisms, and injustice routes.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We expect civil society and the families of femicide victims to benefit from our work as a memorial reparation process but also society at large from a higher degree of awareness of the effects of the growing GBV during the pandemic.  It will not be necessary to transfer the tool or result to an interested party, because from the beginning they own the process and the tool. Families, will probably share the result with their social media, it will be seen by several actors, and probably contribute to understand the problem better.
