## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Our journey on digital transformation of the public sector has opened our eyes to the following key insights:

- Many government ministries and entities are using digital tools to improve their services delivery. But, they working in silo and, therefore, there no synergy around a national vision in terms of digital transformation;

- The penetration rate of digital technologies are low compared to our neighbors in RBLAC;

- The private sector shows openness to digital technologies. 

- Universities (both private and public) are adopting the digital technologies. Some students start developing digital solutions to local problems.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Our digital transformation effort is still ongoing. We are working with government to set-up a steering committee to facilitate the elaboration of an inclusive digital strategy for Haiti.
## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Digital technologies are still under-used in Haiti, and we don't have many sources to leverage for our work. We have dug in the literature and, then, we managed to map the main stakeholders to organize a consultative workshop. Our work allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of digital ecosystem in Haiti with its main drivers.
