Electricity access is a challenge in the rural areas of Bangladesh, making it difficult to set up multimedia class rooms in such areas. This high tech solar powered low cost multimedia solution consisting of a single board computer (capable of storing any type of digital content) and a high resolution monitor (allowing teachers to project any content) is addressing this challenge in the remotest parts of Bangladesh.
