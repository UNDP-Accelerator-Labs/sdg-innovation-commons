> Title of the innovation

IMPROVING PRE-SCHOOL, PRIMARY SCHOOL &amp; SECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEMS WITH THE VIEW OF HAVING AS MANY SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATES AS POSSIBLE.

> Brief description of the innovation

THIS INNOVATION IS ALL ABOUT INCREASING NUMBERS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATES IN MY COMMUNITY. WHICH CAN BE ATTAINABLE BY BUILDING AS MANY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AS POSSIBLE [MORE THAN 100] TO ACCOMMODATE A LARGE POPULATION. SUCH INNOVATION WILL MAKE EDUCATION READILY AVAILABLE, AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO MANY PEOPLE THEREBY REDUCING ILLITERACY LEVELS, NUMBER OF DRUG ABUSERS, TEENAGE PREGNANCIES AND NUMBER OF CRIMINALS. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNEMPLOYED TEACHERS. 
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH WILL BE BUILT, WILL BE PRIVATE AND REGISTERED UNDER MINISTRY OF EDUCATION BUT INDEPENDENT IN OPERATION. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON GOVERNMENT WHICH ALSO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING FOR GOVERNMENT OWNED SCHOOLS. FURTHERMORE, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WILL BE IN THE FORM OF TUITION CENTRES AND SMALL SCHOOLS WITH QUALIFIED TEACHERS OF HIGH STANDARDS. I, PERSONALLY, HAVE ATTENDED A TUITION CENTRE WHICH PROVIDED HIGH QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAN THE TEACHINGS WHICH I RECEIVED FROM SOME TEACHERS AT SCHOOL. 
A SMALL SCHOOL OR TUITION CENTRE ACCOMMODATES ONLY A SMALL POPULATION OF PUPILS AND SO TEACHERS HAVE MUCH TIME TO ATTEND TO EACH AND EVERY PUPIL. THEREFORE, THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AMONGST PUPILS IS VERY HIGH. WHEN THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF PUPILS IS HIGH MANY PUPILS WILL BE OBTAINING GOOD GRADES AND AS I BELIEVE "HAVING GOOD GRADES AT SCHOOL ARE A BUILDING BLOCK OF A LITERATE ZAMBIAN."  IN ADDITION, SMALL POPULATION OF PUPILS IS A GOOD IDEA IN THIS COVID-19 ERA. THUS, THERE WILL BE NO OVERCROWDING IN THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AS COMPARED TO GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS THEREBY AVOIDING CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS WHERE NOT NECESSARY.
I ASSURE YOU THAT WHEN THIS INNOVATION IS PUT INTO PRACTICAL MY COMMUNITY WHICH HAS HIGH LEVELS OF ILLITERACY WILL SURELY IMPROVE AND AT LARGE ZAMBIA WILL DEVELOP. THE LITERACY LEVEL WILL BE INCREASED FROM 86.75% T0 90%, TEENAGE PREGNANCIES WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES WILL BE REDUCED AND UNEMPLOYED TEACHERS WILL BE EMPLOYMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF WAITING FOR GOVERNMENT TO EMPLOY THEM. ABOVE ALL, MY COMMUNITY WILL HAVE MORE GRADE 12 GRADUATES LIKE NEVER BEFORE IN HISTORY.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

MY INNOVATION WILL GENERATE INCOME FOR UNEMPLOYED QUALIFIED TEACHERS WAITING FOR GOVERNMENT ADMISSION. THIS INCOME WILL BE GENERATED FROM A SMALL POPULATION OF PUPILS AT EACH SMALL SCHOOL OR TUITION CENTRE WHO WILL BE PAYING AN AFFORDLE AMOUNT OF SCHOOL FEES. THEREFORE, TEACHER UNEMPLOYMENT AND HIGH ILLITERACY LEVELS WILL BE A LONG GONE STORY.

MARKET TARGET IS MY COMMUNITY, WHERE WE HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF ILLITERACY. THIS CHALLENGE PRIZE WILL INCREASE LITERACY LEVELS THEREBY HAVING MANY PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS IN MY SOCIETY WHICH INTURN CONTRIBUTE TO ZAMBIAS DEVELOPMENT.

THE MANY VALUE ADDITION OF THE INNOVATION ON ENVIRONMENT IS INCREASED LITERATE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT IS OCCUPIED BY LITERATE PEOPLE IT IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF HENCE IT WON'T BE AN HARMFUL ENVIRONMENT TO LIVE IN.

> Technical Feasibility

MY INNOVATION IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH AND EVERY PART OF MY COMMUNITY HAS A PRE-SCHOOL, PRIMARY SCHOOL, SECONDARY SCHOOL AND A READ &amp; WRITING SCHOOL FOR ILLITERATE ADULTS. ALL THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS  HAVING MANY TEACHERS TO ACCOMMODATE THE POPULATION OF PUPILS AT EACH SCHOOL, HAVING GOOD SANITATION, LIBRARIES AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.

FOR A START THIS INNOVATION IS ONLY CATERING A POPULATION OF MY COMMUNITY WHICH I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF EXTENDED TO ALL PARTS OF ZAMBIA ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS WHERE SCHOOLS ARE NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE. SEEING MY COMMUNITY DEVELOP IS MY WISH. I STRONGLY FEEL THIS INNOVATION WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE LITERACY LEVELS IN ZAMBIA. I PLAN TO START THIS INNOVATION IN MY RESIDENTIAL AREA THOUGH I AM NOT EVEN A QUALIFIED TEACHER BUT JUST A SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATE BECAUSE IT SADDENS ME SEEING A PERSON WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW READ AND WRITE.

> Anticipated Social Impact

"EDUCATION IS A KEY TO SUCCESS" YES, IT IS AND I BELIEVE. WHEN A PERSON HAS AN EDUCATIONAL MIND HE/SHE WILL KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THINGS PROPERLY, WILL KNOW A WAY OF DOING THINGS PERFECTLY, WILL KNOW HOW TO BUDGET THINGS NICELY AND WILL KNOW MANY PRODUCTIVE WAYS OF DOING THINGS. THIS INNOVATION WILL CHANGE SOMEONE'S FUTURE, IMPROVE SOMEONE'S LIVE, IMPROVE SOMEONE'S BUSINESS SKILLS AND AT LARGE IMPROVE MANY ASPECTS OF SOMEONE'S LIFESTYLE. 

I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS INNOVATION IS VERY RELEVANT LOOKING AT THE LEVEL OF ILLITERACY IN MY COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, IF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INCREASED MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WILL AT LEAST BE OCCUPIED WITH SCHOOL THINGS AT THE EXPENSE OF ABUSING DRUGS AND ENGAGING IN OTHER ANTI-SOCIAL ACTIVITIES.

AS A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN OF ZAMBIA AND RESPONSIBLE MEMBER OF MY COMMUNITY MY WISH IS SEEING LEVELS OF ILLITERACY COMPLETELY DIMINISHED.
