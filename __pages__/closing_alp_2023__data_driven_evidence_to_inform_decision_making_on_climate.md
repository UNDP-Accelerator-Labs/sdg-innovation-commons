## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Key institutional stakeholders (Ministry of Environment and municipalities) recognize the lack and need of having high resolution and more frequent geolocated insights to complement their decision making processes

2. Data driven methods (feasibility analysis in ArcGIS Pro) based on open and municipal-level data have shown promising results and high utility for different teams in the Ministry of Environment.

3. Open mapping tools (like Open Data Kit - ODK) and citizen science have shown positive results on the design and development of data collection instruments. Main challenges include engaging a critical mass of data collectors (institutional, volunteers, communities) and integration to other data analysis and visualization tools.

4. The strategy for incrementing institutional data capacities (existing infrastructure and technical staff knowledge) has proven to be partially effective. It is necessary to re-think a new approach incorporating other key players like academia (for software development) and private sector (for sustainable business models).

5. Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) has emerged as a promising avenue to overcome the key challenges identified, making data-driven solutions somehow independent from government institutional capacities, and rather as a supply of new services where institutions can 'consume' and contribute to data-driven approaches.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The feasibility analysis method and related data sources is currently being incorporated into the National Information System for Climate Change.

A open mapping tool was utilized by the Ministry of Environment to collect information in 100+ municipalities (30%+) nationwide.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The lack of geolocated municipal data was a gap jointly identified with the Ministry of Environment. Therefore relevant efforts were dedicated in integrating existing data, and estimating and collecting missing data.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The methods used helped validating the utility of data-driven insights for key institutional stakeholders, and involuntarily have shown key associated challenges to overcome for scaling, and potential avenues to follow.
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge. 


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the partner:

Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN, by its acronym in Spanish)


</div>



<div class="group">


> What sector does your partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

Collaborated with three technical teams with the support of the vice-minister, in jointly integrating relevant data sources, testing data analysis methods, and co-designing data collection tools. This being a novel approach than the traditional programmatic project implementation.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

Through a non-financial agreement (Statement of Intent) signed with HOT in 2023, we jointly co-designed and implemented several data collection tools and run workshops for increasing capacities of institutional and UNDP personnel.

Through a cost-recovery collaboration, we jointly developed a proof-of-concept, including the integration of new geolocated data, the development and testing of a data analysis method, the deployment of a dashboard for visualizing results, and the delivery to key institutional stakeholders.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By bringing different data analysis and collection expertise, we were able to produce proof-of-concepts in a more agile way, while untapping key challenges for scaling that were difficult to anticipate.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
