Overall goal: Contribute to the transition to sustainable development through the co-production of knowledge aimed at localizing the SDGs. Specific goals: Diagnose the existing socioeconomic and institutional situation to localize the SDGs. Develop a localization plan for the SDGs. Incorporate Education for Sustainable Development in the curriculum of Colegio Superior 42 (CS42). Build a communications strategy to engage society around the SDGs.

Description of citizen participation  Teaching staff, civil servants and social organizations participate in workshops where records are produced. The workshops will basically comprise two types depending on their participants. Type I workshops consist of researchers and municipal professionals. Type II workshops consist of civil society participants, professionals, stakeholders, specialists, and other participants deemed appropriate for better process development and promotion. In both workshops, people in charge of coordinating the project prepare a work agenda with the topics to be discussed, considering the problems that will be addressed, the hypothesis and the knowledge that they intend to process and discuss from a local perspective. The workshops are interactive and written and visual records are obtained for later use in reports and publications. In addition, in both cases, surveys are conducted to establish the starting points (baselines) of the project, involving high school and college teachers, municipal officials, and representatives of local organizations and institutions.
