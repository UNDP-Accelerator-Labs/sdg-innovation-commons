## Title

Working together towards an uncertain future: Supporting the National Innovation Policy of Dominican Republic
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to advice the DR government with designing the country’s first national innovation policy, through an inclusive, agile and widely participatory, whole-of-society approach, and to be delivered within a tight time span. Specifically, we will provide agile methods, articulate knowledge transfer schemes, and advice on best practices across UNDP’s global network of expertise.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

For decades, the DR has been lagging behind in most global innovation measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for innovation and agile government became a salient topic of conversation across political and policymaking circles. Yet, despite the evident needed, the country did not have a high-level innovation strategy in place. In 2021, the Dominican government created the Innovation Cabinet, an inter-ministerial coordination committee with the main mandate of crafting the National Innovation Policy. The presidential decree divided the cabinet’s work around five themes: 1) governance, 2) human capital, 3) investment and partnerships, 4) culture and citizenship, and 5) energy transition and sustainability.   The DR’s presidency invited UNDP Dominican Republic to accompany this initiative and contribute with our global experience in the design of this critical policy. Together, the UNDP Strategic Innovation Unit, Acceleration Lab and our national specialists have accompanied the process with methodological tools and technical assistance, aligned with the principles of our new strategic plan, which promotes innovation for supporting countries to achieve structural transformations, build resilience and leave no one behind. The experience has been an example of how the combination of UNDP's local and global knowledge is an instrument at the service of the countries where we operate.

The Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks world economies according to their innovation capabilities. Consisting of roughly 80 indicators, grouped into innovation inputs and outputs, the GII aims to capture the multi-dimensional facets of innovation.   Dominican Republic ranks 93rd among the 132 economies featured in the Global Innovation Index 2021.The relationship between income levels (GDP per capita) and innovation performance (GII score) is the expected innovation performance and in our case relative to GDP, Dominican Republic’s performance is below expectations for its level of development.   Innovation Ecosystem according the UNDP Digital Development Compas index https://www.digitaldevelopmentcompass.o rg/country/DOM   Innovation Ecosystem 2.22 86% Data Availability Availability of scientists and engineers 3.03 World Bank: World Development Indicators Banking Ecosystem size1.58 IMF/The Global Economy: Bank assets to GDP - Country rankings Country, Industry, Skill Migration Data (Country)2.59 World Bank/LinkedIn: Digital Data For Development Country, Industry, Skill Migration Data (Industry)2.58 World Bank/LinkedIn: Digital Data For Development Country, Industry, Skill Migration Data (Skill)4.59 World Bank/LinkedIn: Digital Data For Development Digital Work Ecosystem size1.99 The Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute: Digital Platform Economy Index International industrial applications by origin (Hague System)2.1 WIPO: Intellectual Property Statistics International industrial designs by origin (Hague System)1.99 Source Data Unavailable   International patent applications by origin (PCT System)3 WIPO: Intellectual Property Statistics Mobile app creation/bn PPP$ GDP1 Global Innovation Index/App Annie Intelligence: Mobile app creation/bn PPP$ GDP Patents by origin/bn PPP$ GDP 1.04 Global Innovation Index/WIPO: Patents by origin/bn PPP$ GDP Scientific and technical articles/bn PPP$ GDP1.11 Global Innovation Index/Clarivate, Web of Science: Scientific and technical articles/bn PPP$ GDP

Through interviews with key stakeholders, and in the intervention design process itself: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l6OabMk=/?share_link_id=188654077529


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator lab’s approach to the policy design process was to encompass a wide range of stakeholders through a mix of methods: ·         Integrative role: we sought to benchmark on the best practices in innovation policy, though UNDP’s connections with governments and partner institutions in the Latin American and Caribbean region.   ·         Focus on inclusion and participation of people / society as a whole, making sure as many voices as possible across all socioeconomic strata were herd during the design process   ·         Participatory work methodologies based on human-centered design.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

“UNDP supports the DR government’s effort to place innovation at the forefront of policymaking and achieve systemic change in the Dominican Republic”

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We need to understand the government team’s capabilities as well as their readiness to take on the responsibility of designing the policy.   We need to know the different actors and problems perceived in the present ecosystem, and the future visual.   We need to know the different plans, strategies and programs in process regarding innovation in the country.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

·         Agile: for the structure, organization, and management of our agile project management challenge, including training sessions with the governance team at the beginning and during the process.   ·         Design Thinking / Human Centered Design / Co-creation: For the design of the work plan and its different activities: capacity transfer sessions, work and delivery sessions, and matching process. ·         Ethnography: training in qualitative methods, to work on the following products: survey with the diaspora in NY, and participatory process in person at universities in the country.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There little systematized information available on innovation in the DR. In addition, deeper problems with institutional capacities in collecting, storing and generating value from data might be worth addressing prior to the issue of data gaps.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Each of the four initial working groups (1) governance, 2) human capital, 3) investment and partnerships, 4) culture and citizenship), plus the fifth group added later (5 energy transition and sustainability), offer great opportunities to contribute to the 2030 Agenda in the country. The National Innovation Policy 2030 of the Dominican Republic is vital for the promotion of different sectors, and together with other development policies can be a great enabler and example of how to co-create with people at the center.   The subsequent stage would be the accompaniment of public policy actions that impede the current system, accelerating the transition to the future state.
