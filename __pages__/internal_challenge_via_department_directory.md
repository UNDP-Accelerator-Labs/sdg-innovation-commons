Internal Challenge via Department Directory
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that communication within the CO is weak, which in its turn make internal relationships and work flows difficult.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In the beginning of 2021 the RR gave us and Internal Challenge to explore the relationship between Programme and Operations and well as national and international staff in the CO as he had sensed inner tensions within the office. Our challenge became to explore if there were any issues and propose possible solutions of how to improve the internal relationships. Our team responded to the challenge by taking on a Design Thinking process where we set out on a journey to interview all staff in the CO and co creating solutions together with them.   From our synthesis the main outcomes where: As response to the initial learning questions exploring the relationship between Programme /Operations and national/international staff, we found that:   - The relationship between Programme and Operations can be improved - There are not much tension between National and international staff, but differences in work conditions can create jealousy In addition to the initial challenges that were given to us, we found three emerging challenges who all affected the initial questions.  -Lack of communication is affecting negatively the relationship between colleagues and staff doesn't understand the work of their colleagues.  - There are no physical or virtual meeting spaces for colleagues to interact, understand each other and overcome barriers  - Differences in work conditions between national and international staff is creating jealousy and tension between colleagues Our main focus is "lack of communication within the CO", which is being caused/ driven by the fact that colleagues don’t share their work enough/ or in a format that can transcend information efficiently. Cultural and language barriers is also a cause for the situation as the office is international and colleagues has expressed their need to have greater access to language courses. The pandemic situation is adding to the fact that it is hard to communicate and interact and the physical space of the office (long corridors, small isolated offices and no meeting places) doesn’t provide spaces to interact. Everyone in the CO is involved, and the situation leads to unawareness of each other’s work leading to uniformed decisions, double work as colleagues work on the same thing without knowing it, missed opportunities for synergies and collaborations, lack of team spirit and decreased efficiency.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value that the Accelerator Lab is bringing to this challenge is the ability to bring a human centred perspective and co create solutions together with colleagues, who operate closest to the challenge/problem. The lab brings the unique ability to test fast, try and retry to see what works and does not work.  Focusing on this challenge can hopefully bring more understanding and efficiency inside the CO, ultimately improving the way UNDP is seen by external partners and the population.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we display the role of our colleagues in the office? How might we overcome barriers created by COVID-19? How might we identify the hierarchy of the CO? How might we facilitate communication between colleagues?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We have been using Design thinking as a way of approaching this complex challenge. Participatory Design, Co-Creation and Collective Intelligence was part of the process when identifying and brainstorming possible solutions. These innovation methods will continue to play a big role as we are moving into the Testing phase where we will continue to evaluate and co create ways of improving our prototypes. Additionally, we have used visual thinking & mapping in order to map each colleague in a visual manner to facilitate the barriers to created by COVID-19 where namely staff could not come into the office and interact as usual. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There were a big data gap before we started as no data collection was made on the topic. The methods above will help us produce data to make better informed decisions and helps us address the soft side and the human centred angle of the challenge.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

HR (national and global) because they have a focus on the well being of the staff, the UNDP Global Team and United Nations University. With that being said, the country office has already onboarded these initial tests and are incorporated into their communication strategy.
