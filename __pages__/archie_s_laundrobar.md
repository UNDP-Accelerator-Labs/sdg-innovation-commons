> Brief description of the innovation

ARCHIE'S LAUNDROBAR is an innovation initiative from an entrepreneurial sense so to speak. Its a start-up business I implemented on the 8th of May 2021 in Kabwata. Some call it boughetto as it brought the bougie to the ghetto meaning the upping of standard simply.  It is to comprise of two parts being a bar/restaurant and Laundromat. The idea is to have clients wait for their laundry as they have a meal and or drink. I managed to implement phase 1 being the restaurant/bar and yet to implement phase 2 the laundromat.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Not only have i created employment opportunities but further created a value chain which allows me and others around me to grow for example the 28 year old farmer I purchase vegetables from on a weekly basis and the 30 year old whose disinfectant services I continue to employ on a monthly basis; these and many others who eventually also end up plowing into others and thus this value chain affects the livelihoods of many thus speaking to SDGs like Decent Work and Economic Growth in a nutshell.
The Restaurant side of the business allowed me to hire a chef and three assistants. The food industry if handled well is a lucrative business which connects to the agricultural sector. I purchase vegetables, mealie meal, relish, cooking oil almost on a fortnightly basis and this allows farmers and middlemen being owners of stores/stands to grow equally. The bar side has seen me employing a Manager, 2 bartenders and 2 waiters however, the recent hard economic times forced me to let go of some of my workers as it proved to be unsustainable in the long run. I'm praying that with the political change a more inclusive and sustainable business environment will grow.

> Technical Feasibility

Initially Archie's Laundrobar was supposed to have a restaurant/bar and laundromat running side by side however, due to lack of funding I was only able to implement phase 1 being the restaurant/bar. Phase 1 had me tapping into all my savings and working extra jobs to get it off the ground running as it was not financially viable to get a loan at the time due to high interest rates.
I targeted Kabwata which can be described a a low-middle income area with low to middle-income earners who have buying power for affordably priced goods and services. After doing thorough market research it proved to be a viable business idea that could be built on especially if invested in.
Having only managed to get phase 1 off the ground I decided that phase 2 being the laundromat would grow off phase 1 and gave this the space of a year to do so. However, the journey so far proved tumultuous as Covid Restrictions came in and brought business to a halt for almost 2 months. I had to think outside the box and got myself aligned to AfriDelivery and Tigmoo to allow the business to continue running amidst the challenges being experienced. 
My long term plan is to open an entire chain store all round Zambia and I would employ the same business model being market research and remaining flexible to change and open to innovation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I received over 60 job applications and in the week I advertised for the positions of Bartender(2), Chef(4), Waiter(3) and Cleaner(1) when i needed only 10 positions to be filled. To date my email is still receiving applications from candidates who are desperately in need of jobs. If I could I would employ more I would and thus it is for this reason that i apply for funding to allow my innovation not to end just in Kabwata but open up even more chain restaurants all around Lusaka and eventually outside of Lusaka. Like KFC and McDonald's I would like to create a food chain restaurant that contributes to the Gross Domestic Product of Zambia.
The few persons I managed to employ may not be considered to be in the rich or wealthy bracket however, they are grateful for what they get at the end of the month, as this sustains them and their families. I have not begun to break even as yet and as such have had to work extra jobs to pay rentals and salaries but its a challenge i will overcome and will not throw in the towel as i believe as a single mother I can make an impact in Zambia and 10 employees may seem like a drop in the ocean but it begins with 1 step.
As earlier stated the growth doesn't end with myself but the links created in supply (purchase) chain have allowed me to add value addition to related businesses that are owned by young entrepreneurs like myself.
