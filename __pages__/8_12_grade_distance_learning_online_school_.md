> Title of the innovation

8-12 Grade Distance Learning(Online School)

> Brief description of the innovation

Replacing trading learning with affordable online learning from grade 8 to 12 for students who can not attend traditional-based learning due to disabilities or personal preference. This platform has already proved to work for Higher learning students all over the world who attain degrees and master's degrees via distance learning, why not bring this highly convenient initiative to the population that will find it favorable, in high schools, to solve problems of time, distance, and cost.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This platform could provide educators with jobs and income. As you well know the cost of school physical property is a factor that makes education costs high, this issue would be resolved as physical space would be replaced by a cheaper online workspace, that has lower maintenance costs. Our target market would be students between 8 and 12 grades who are already quite savvy with using online platforms. The challenge prize would be used to develop the platform, this would also help contract our very first teachers.

> Technical Feasibility

At the moment we have no prototype but have the knowledge and skill, of experienced IT software developers from ZCAS. Graduated with Honors.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With Covid and after Covid notions of remote work and remote learning will continue to exist in a nonstandard way that is slowly being standardized, our use case actors or end-users will be those that will want to continue to learn online, of course, this is a trend we believe will grow over time and we would want to be the first with your support. This platform will provide education for those that cannot travel to the school because of disability or location, and or can not afford expensive traditional school due to overheads that come with operating a traditional school that is passed on to the students.
