Share A Plate, Reduce the Waste initiative: Neighbor

> Brief description of the innovation

The Share A Plate, Reduce the waste initiative is aimed at contributing to the fight against world hunger by developing a comfortable, secure and easy to access medium used by communities for sharing resources with each other. This proposal not only promotes efficiency in food management at household level but is also a platform that can be used engage different communities in solving common problems and promoting positive change. Modern day challenges sometimes require modern solutions and, in this case, - Neighbor: which is a mobile application that allows for community member the share food and/or non-food resources that would have otherwise gone to waste.   
The mission of this initiative is to ensure distribution of excess and/or donated food to the people in need of it by allowing for community and local organization’s participation in the design of the application. This helps create stronger community relationships, reduce wastage of resources, promote reuse (non-food resources), and connects its members to their needs with the help from within these communities.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The foundational concept of this initiative is not revenue generation but to provide ease and improved efficiency in the grassroot management of resources which helps gain value for the whole community that chooses to participate in the initiative. We hope to execute this program not in the interest of business profits but local community development and enriching all participants with knowledge on the importance of this initiative and chance to build networks.      
With that being said, the project initiative will seek partnerships with local organizations and provide advertisements space in line the initiative’s core purpose in order to sustain its operations and impact to the communities.

> Technical Feasibility

Note that everything shared through this proposed application is completely free to the recipients with no strings attached and the design of the Neighbor Mobile Application is in such a way that it allows its user to see the description and location of what is available. The application will have the option communicate with other members of your community and organizations participating on how collecting shared resources. 
This initiative will also partner with local society organization to help facilitate drop-offs and pick-ups to their local communities and the application design will allow interested parties to donate what they feel most comfortable with.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Aside from the more obvious benefits to this proposal, I believe implementing it will spark more creative solutions that address specific community challenges and it will be a great way to get the youths involved in positive change advocacy and   promote climate action through civic engagement.
