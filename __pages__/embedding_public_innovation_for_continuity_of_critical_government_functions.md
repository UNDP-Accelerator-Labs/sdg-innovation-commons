Embedding Public innovation for Continuity of Critical Government Functions

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that how might we provide avenues for digitizing public services through open innovation and public private partnership to ensure continuity of critical services during and post the COIVD-19 pandemic.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

-        In Ethiopia, the first COVID case was confirmed on 9th March 2020 in Ethiopia. The pandemic is now more than a health crisis affecting the macro-economy, businesses, and livelihoods of people significantly. The impact is presumed to be significant in developing countries like Ethiopia, whose economy is volatile and predominantly informal, despite steady and strong growth over the past several years.  Using the accelerator lab as a means, UNDP embarked on finding local solutions by engaging and working with the technology and innovation industry.

-        Remote work and full and partial lockdowns are essential ways of fighting the spread of COVID 19 however they are challenges to the services the public sector provides especially when those services require physical presence. In Ethiopia, majority of government services are provided in person, even sometimes needing multiple trips as we discovered through our exploration exercises. Recognizing the need to digitize, many government institutions are in the early stages of building digital portals and connecting government agencies to execute e-services portals. But this initiative became much more critical since the onset of the pandemic when institutions needed to reduce the number of citizens that came to their premises.

-        Recognizing this need, the country office partnered up with the Civil Service Commission to identify 34 institutions that are providing critical services, train them in business continuity procedure and provided equipment and tools like zoom license to support the immediate needs for the transition to remote work. Parallelly, however, the accelerator lab wanted to look at innovative and long-term local solutions the institution can use to address their digitization challenges.

Digital Ethiopia 2025 strategy

·       Ethiopian government in its digital strategy, prioritized digitization of government and public services as internet coverage is increasing at annual rate of 45%.  There is also an increased mobile subscription (60% in 2017). However, the government services are predominantly handled via manual operations.

·       Currently only 50[AT1]  are available across six institutions. Misalignment between institutions, poor infrastructure connectivity, and limited digital skills are some of the challenges hindering full rollout of E-Services on the government’s existing portal.

·       Ethiopia only collected 40% of the targeted Tax revenues with one of the challenges being a lack of integrated data on business operations, and cumbersome filing, payment, and compliances processes.

·       E-readiness assessment

·       In an evaluation of 42 ministries and government institutions assessed for readiness to provide e-services based on status of IT infrastructure, success of previous e-service projects and the staff's IT skills, 27 (64%) were found to be medium or high in their readiness to provide e-services.

what are these 50? [AT1]

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

-        The lab is better positioned to identify innovative solutions that address the needs we identified through our problem definition and identification exercises with the government institutions. Because we closely work with the innovation ecosystem, we offer the unique value of mapping existing solutions in the tech/ digital space that we have worked with previously. In addition, we can bring a systemic view and go beyond just identifying the solutions but also connecting stakeholders thorough unusual partnerships, providing continuous technical support and lining up growth and scale opportunities.

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Prototyping and Co-creation is allowing the winning solution and the government institutions to test and co-design the solutions in ways that best fit both the citizen’s and the institution's needs.

Human Centered Design is used to make sure the proposed solution is addressing the issues it set out to solve in ways that serve the purpose. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Government services public satisfaction data is not easily accessible, while digitizing of government services could embed these types of data that will be used for product redesigning and iterative testing. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This process will identify and test innovative solution that will allow government institutions to continue providing critical services during the pandemic and beyond.  It will create a connection between the public and private sector to allow government institutions to provide services efficiently while supporting private technology sector grow.  The solution can then be adapted and refined with the government institution that participated on the sensemaking and problem defining process of the challenge. Because the solution is geared towards movement institutions the Ministry of Innovation and Technology will play a big role in mainstreaming not just the solutions but also the concept of involving the private sector in growing government technologies.
