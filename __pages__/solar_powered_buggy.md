Buggy powered by solar panels was built during MCO as petrol delivery into the rural areas were limited and scarce. Transport of goods from urban to villages were also disrupted and the buggy helps to transport between neighborhood. The four solar batteries provide 1000aH and can last for 3 days without recharging.
