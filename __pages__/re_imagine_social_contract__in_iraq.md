Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq is examining the weak social contract in Iraq and supporting the UNDP country office to re-imagine social contract in the country through taking part of Deep Demonstration Initiative and utilizing portfolio approach and the AccLab localized knowledge and network. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The UNDP CO in Iraq conducted “Re-Imagining Social Contract in Iraq” research in 2021 and seeks to identify ways in which to re-think and transform social contract in the country, working in partnership with stakeholders. The research main findings include:  Research participants identified corruption as the main issue in Iraq and saw it as ingrained in the political system. Focus group participants and survey respondents thought that addressing corruption REIMAGINING THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IN IRAQ Page 4 should be the most important priority for the Government. They found that the most significant impediments to political participation was corruption and its deep links to the current governance system. Focus group participants also reported facing daily struggles to access services due to corruption as it is cutting across all layers of Iraq’s social fabric. Addressing this would have a positive effect on the social contract and other key issues identified in this paper.  Research participants made it clear that they have lost faith in the political process. Elections were seen as potential drivers of change but voting was not viewed as influencing change. Both focus group and survey participants felt unrepresented by the muhasasa system and associated elections with fraud and corruption. Trust in politics and state institutions was low. Overall, there was a clear desire to move from identity-based to issue-based politics. Gender plays a key role in shaping grievances and demands.  Gender dimensions were prominent across all core grievances and issues identified in this paper. Men and women generally saw issues differently. Women offered very clear understandings of how tackling one issue would have positive repercussions for others—for example, by linking measures against corruption to better service provision, greater security and a fairer political process. They demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of what needs to change and how to feel societal and gender norms prevent their active participation in politics. Personal security is in decline according to participants. Perceptions of security and core issues related to it varied depending on gender, community and location. Nevertheless, both focus group and survey participants saw their personal security as declining. The main issues were unregulated weapons, unfair representation in the security forces, the continued power of non-state actors, discrimination and harassment, and poor control over borders. People also felt threatened by the State and denounced restrictions on freedom of expression, especially those expressing dissent and/or participating in protests and demonstrations.  Expectations of the Government are very high. People highlighted that they expect the Government to provide subsidized services and a guaranteed welfare system as well as public sector employment and representation in the political system. Yet they also agreed that they lack civic education and a complete understanding of what their rights and duties are under the social contract. Citizens are key agents of change. Both focus group and survey participants described themselves as agents of change. Most survey respondents agreed they should educate themselves on what they can do to initiate change, and indicated a lack of civic education and awareness of rights and responsibilities in terms of the State and fellow citizens. As one of the groups most affected by Iraq’s current situation, youth were seen as major change agents. Yet there was also a widespread perception that they lack the skills and experience needed to effectively participate in political processes.  With the economic situation steadily worsening, creating employment needs to be part of a reimagined social contract. Grievances and discontent over Iraq’s reliance on oil revenue are not new nor are demands to diversify the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative additional impact. The lack of job opportunities, especially for youth, was a major concern and frustration driving the 2019 protests. Focus group and survey participants stressed that wealth and opportunities must be distributed more equally.
