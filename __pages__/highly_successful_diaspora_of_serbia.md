"Highly successful diaspora of Serbia" solution is a database of highly successful Serbian diaspora, their characteristics and potentials for the needs of responsible actors, ie decision-makers, then researchers and all those who care about the diaspora and their ties with Serbia. The intention is to use the data available on the Internet within various business and scientific databases in order to better understand the phenomenon of the outmigration of highly educated people from the country and the potential they can offer to the motherland if lasting partnership is established.
