> Brief description of the innovation

Fashionable shoes and slippers which are made with Chitenge material.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

According to my primary data I received from the most consumers, I am very confidently it will generate an income for me as well as others.
This innovation will support mainly young entrepreneurs who could want to start their own businesses, as well as marketers.
My main targeted market are: marketers, Wholesales, as well as street vendors. This will be possible through advertisement of our products, on TV, RADIO and many other services.
The winning of prize will not only help in the growth of the business but also help to end poverty among the youths as well as women. As it will provide decent employments, economic growth and help to achieve equality.
Preservation of cultural values at the same time recognize quality and fashionable shoes and slippers.

> Technical Feasibility

Chitenge shoes and slippers theses are foot wear which are designed with Chitenge material out side on top of the slipper, for shoes are covered with a Chitenge outside.
This prototype as already got the attention to most customers, and have sold about 50 pairs in the first month. 
I carried a survey and ask if there was anything to improve on, but mostly answers I got were positive to most consumers, though I still believe there is room to modernise this prototype and sale at a low but profitable price.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation is relevant to the market as it is not only provide decent work for youths and women, but it also support the fashion industry as well as to preserve the African Culture.
In this error industries are looking for new solutions every day to keep up the competition on the market therefore I strongly believe this innovation will stand the test of time and supported on the market.
