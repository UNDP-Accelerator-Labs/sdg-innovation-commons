> Brief description of the innovation

LETSDOGOOD is an online platform (mobile app and website) that enables people in Zambia to connect and share food, clothing, household items and capital for small businesses. 
At #LetsDogood, we want to strengthen the sense of community and build a Zambia that is equal – where people share what they have instead of throwing away. Our platforms give people an opportunity share with whomever and whenever they want. Further, it also dignifies that are lacking to connect to resources and pick what they need when they need it. In short, the platforms make sharing and receiving easy.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Private sector and non-governmental organisations invest funds in documenting their sustainability or corporate social responsibility efforts. With all the photos, stories and documentaries, the government and public still do not have a clearer understanding of activities and impact. 
In response, the LetsDoGood website and app will provide these partners a visibility and advertising platform. At the end of every, the public will rate the best project or most responsibility company, the entity will be awarded a certificate. 
Additionally, through the donation crowd funding service provided to small medium enterprises through, the platform will collect a 15% administration fee. 
The challenge prize will support the official launch as well as the offline and online marketing of the platform.
The value addition of this innovation on the environment is anchored on creating understanding on social and environmental challenges Zambia is facing. The website has a change makers page and awareness campaign banner. Through these features, we will share stories of community heroes as well as run free awareness campaigns in partnerships with government, donors, civil society organisations and others. Focus will be on various issues including climate change topics like renewable energy, recycling plastic, access to clean water, waste, and agriculture.

> Technical Feasibility

The technology used to create the #LetsDoGood website is JavaScript. Flutter was used to create the #LetsDoGood app. The app works on android and iOS. Users can create an account that allows them to share and receive. User data and posts are stored on a highly secure database (google firebase). User data is only viewed by select personal of Ideate innovations. However, images of shared items and usernames are shared with the community. 
Additionally, all posts on the website and app are on a first come first serve basis and internet connection is required to use the app. 
Implementation Plan 
1.	Assemble Governance Team that will ensure accountability and success of the platform. 
2.	Testing –involves User Experience,  Device and Platform testing. Both the website and app have been tested on different devices with the app on various android devices with different screens. Functional tests are still being done with all app buttons, and ongoing performance tests with Google and Apple. Security tests are ongoing. 
3.	Launch - October 2021 the platform will be officially Go-live at sharing and receiving event with key stake holders. Activations will be in Lusaka. Online promotion will be on Google Adsense and social media.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The LETSDOGOOD website and app are designed to respond to NOW problems and while working towards sustainability. When a user is hungry, we CONNECT them to free food shared by individuals, restaurants, or supermarkets. When a student needs an outfit for a job interview, a couple needs a suit or wedding dress, bed or utensils, we make that happen too. Also, we recognize that small businesses often lack access to funding or get loans with unsustainable interest rates. The donation crowdfunding service will enable SMEs to continue trading and grow in turn, contribute to the nation’s economic growth. Further, when our user has excess and immediately wants to share with people outside their family unit or an orphanage, the platform is a solution because it makes connects people to make sharing and receiving easy

To this end, the anticipated impact will be a more empathetic, practical, and connected community anchored on the spirit of Ubuntu.
