> Title of the innovation

Water and sanitation measurements technologies.

> Brief description of the innovation

-promote good hygiene habit through education.
-proper hand washing with soap and water can reduce diarrhea cases by up to 35%.
-implementing rainwater harvesting systems collect and store rain water for drinking or recharging underground aquifer.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector continues to face increasing pressures, especially due to the impacts of climate change, governments in the developing world will need to increase the sector’s resilience and sustainability. Innovation and technology have a vital role to play in scarcity and safety, water efficiency, utility operations, monitoring and treatment and data and analytics.

> Technical Feasibility

-community chlorine marker.
-A drinkable book.
-water generating bill boards.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1.Improve sanitation facilities by providing toilets and latrines that flush into a sewer or safe enclosure.
2.Promote good hygiene habits through education. Proper hand washing with soap and water can reduce diarrhea cases by up to 35 percent.
3.Implement rainwater harvesting systems to collect and store rainwater for drinking or recharging underground aquifers. Build wells to extract groundwater from underground aquifers.
4.Provide home water-treatment capability through the use of filters, solar disinfection, or flocculants, to make drinking water safe.
5.Promote low-cost solutions, such as chlorine tablets or plastic bottles that can be exposed to sunlight, to improve water quality.
