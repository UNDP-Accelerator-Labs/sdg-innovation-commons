## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. There was a spike in online job search during the 2nd wave of the pandemic. 2. Due to nation wide lockdown and international travel bans, undergraduate students seeking abroad education are taking a gap year and entering the national job market for the first time. 3. The use of innovative and effective promotion about the platform proved to be crucial, we launched series of informal discussion with potential user base and also used new online communication channels such as Clubhouse for mass outreach. 4. It is important to create an active network of job providers so we can keep track of the market needs trend and skill requirements. 5. The success of this experiment heavily depends on the up-take from the local level.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There was a lack of coordination and support from the local level. Due to the job rotation of the IT manager in the municipality the project got delayed and re-orientation process of the new recruit took a long time.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We wanted to quantify our quantitative data with qualitative insights thus we used a mix of both technical and non technical methods to collect data. This approach helped us in getting access to new demographics and also identify the best practices to reach out to them.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

AI was at the heart of our solution as it helped us streamline the internal operations of the portal and saved time in terms of job matching. Behavioral Insights helped us in understanding the motivation and intent of our user base and social media analysis helped us in keeping track of our communications activities and if we were able to convert social media hits into actual job matches. 
## Partners
