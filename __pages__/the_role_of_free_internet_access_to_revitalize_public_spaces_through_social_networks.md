## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Víctor A. Tablas

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

20/12/2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Free access to wifi in public spaces - Inclusive digitalization

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

The learning opportunities around this frontier challenge are many, so for this portfolio of experiments, 4 specific areas will be emphasized about public access to the internet: (1) revitalization of public spaces, (2) opportunities for MSMEs, (3) efficiencies for users and (4) social cohesion. This portfolio of experiments tests a total of 10 hypotheses about these areas and this experiment falls in the first mentioned area.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

The Internet and broadband technologies as facilitators of citizen services are becoming increasingly important for development. In particular, internet connectivity, understood as adequately fast broadband and the ownership of access devices, affects the exercise of the rights to health, education and work, and the lack of it can lead to an increase in inequalities. Wi-Fi network providers and experts have also speculated on social benefits, such as building communities, promoting social cohesion, stimulating democracy, and revitalizing and repopulating parks, squares, and other public spaces. One of the most recent examples of connectivity installation in public spaces in El Salvador is that of Balboa Park, which in 2022 has had access for the first time to a 100 Mbps Wi-Fi network. In particular, the learning opportunities around this frontier challenge are many, so&nbsp; learning will be emphasized for 4 specific areas: (1) revitalization of public spaces, (2) opportunities, (3) efficiencies for users and (4) social cohesion. In this context, how can these resources be used in the best way to arouse the interest of potential visitors to public spaces?

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The objective of the experiment is to test whether advertising free internet in Balboa Park is an amenity that generates positive reactions among potential visitors who circulate on social networks (Facebook). Likewise, it is intended to test which message variant generates more reactions among the audiences of the ISTU social networks.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis A: If free access to Wi-Fi in public parks is promoted through Meta Ads, then the effectiveness of the park's promotion on social networks is increased.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

One of the most accurate way to prove whats generates better results in digital platforms lies in the use of A/B/n tests, a type of controlled experiment that takes place online to learn how different elements of the publications affect the reactions they generate between the and the users. A five variant randomized test has been setup in ISTU Meta Account to promote public wi-fi in Balboa Park through different messages and the same image.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Facebook Social media account users in El Salvador

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Meta for Business provides data about costs per view

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity has a low risk

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Hypothesis: If free access to Wi-Fi in public parks is promoted through Facebook Meta Ads, then the effectiveness of the park's promotion on social networks is increased from the control condition.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 1,445

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This experiment is connected to synthetic control experiment to compare the number of visitors of the intervened public park against the 11 other parks without internet connection, to test if advertising the internet in Balboa Park and the the whole 12 park network with the same amount of budget allocated to each public space produces more visits in the next 4 four weeks after advertising is completed.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The lessons generated here are expected to serve as an input for scaling up strategies that work for public policy tools such as the Digital Social Connectivity Program in El Salvador, with a strong component financed by the Inter-American Development Bank to install connectivity and digital infrastructure, as well as for its second component focused on increasing digital skills and competencies. In addition, it is expected that these lessons can be used as Research and Development inputs for components in projects carried out by UNDP on sustainable tourism, the generation of business opportunities and inclusive digitization.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity.&nbsp;**

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

&nbsp;

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Coordination between the national authority and the digital marketing agency hired to produce the arts, to get from proposals to approval.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Peace Building Fund projects working at UNDP in historic memory places to use A/B/n test to obtain insights about what produces more reactions in their indented population groups.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Salvadoran Institute of Tourism and the Secretary of Innovation in El Salvador. The first because this is the first national park with public access to internet, which is a small scale test to implement connectivity efforts in the other 12 parks in El Salvador. The second because during the next few years it will be implementing the Social Connectivity Program in El Salvador, so the results of this portfolio of experiments will be offered as insights to enhance further connectivity efforts in the country.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Conduct a social media plan to determine the approximate number of interactions the A/B/n test will be obtained under different budgets. In this case the digital agency suggested that a total of USD 784 would produce around 1.2 million views. Around 100,000 views per park and for the intervened space approximately 20,000 views per variant (A, B, C, D, E). This sample size is very useful to conduct the pairwise comparisons not only against the control condition but between competing variants and detect very small effects.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely, any development challenge can take advantage of large datasets generated through social networks to obtain insights about what works best to produce reactions among specific population targets online, so the effectiveness of actions and messages can be known in short time and using small budgets.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense 25%, Explore 25%

> What surprised you?

How low cost these type of randomized experiments can be when taken through online means.
