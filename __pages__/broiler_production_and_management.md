> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Broiler production is a more returning and profit making business in Zambia today and it's production attracts a large sector of customers. I have been in this business for 14 years producing not less 115'000 broilers per placement of six batches per year, that is working under a private sector. The manure out of the house is a source nutrients to hot culture farmers lessening soil acidification.

> Technical Feasibility

There's need to build poultry houses, get to finding a suitable and consistent supplier of chicks like hybrid, marketing mostly is available. Subject to placement, implements for production like, feeders, drinkers must be available with a proper number at given standard.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will create jobs, the production innovation will add to the country's food basket, the manure from the houses will be used in organic farming farms which is in turn is a safer way to fend off chemical usage in most hot culture products.
