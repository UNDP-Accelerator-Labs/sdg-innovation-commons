This system is powered by a solar panel and battery. The system has a submissive pump, a reservoir tank and pipes. The solar panel and batteries power the submissive pump which pulls the water from the reservoir/source and pumps it through the pipes. The system is also designed with an automatic switching system which is programmed with a mobile phone with a range of over 5000 miles away, this means that the farmer can be at his or her home and irrigate their farm.
