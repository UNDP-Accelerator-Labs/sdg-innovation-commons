> Brief description of the innovation

The Project is an Education enhancing Access for a Zambian child which target the street kids and the less privileged in the community. This will be done by the contribution from all the stakeholders in the community by skill or money of just K50. The contribution will be put in a business venture cause it will be treated as the last coins that will come. Thereafter, the growth of the business increases the number of pupils benefiting  and also create work/job for community hence achieving economic growth.  
Additionally, the student beneficiaries will be skilled from classroom as well as practical work. 
This has been seen happen from Kabwe and now in solwezi where I started with only 1 this year now we have 7 pupils and additional of 1 worker.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1. The creation of more business investments under/attached to this will increase more income that will help grow the number for beneficiaries and workers.
2. The project will improve the education sector by providing more of the practical skills and close mentorship from the career figures they want to be.
3. The project improves the sector by utilizing the untapped resources(street kids) and diverting into a useful economic tool. Additionally, it will train the students to innovate than just to beg. That’s why the practical and exposure will be the key.
4. The target are the youths, the challenge will help me grow the number and district/provinces where the community can benefit. Besides, the challenge will increase the speed of our growth. And will help acquire even more knowledge of how we communicate to the world. 
5. The challenge will bring exposure not only at provincial level but also at country level, where few workers and pupil beneficiaries will travel abroad on education tour to firms and industries where they can get more exposed to improving education, agriculture, industrial and economic sector.
6. There will be sustainable environmental development, the economic growth and the increase of the greens. Increase vegetation and trees.

> Technical Feasibility

We will be implementing a SPIDER-WEB Re-cycle economy-benefit plan. This is a plan that will receive a dollar, human resource input, produce more and give to the economy. 

Well, when the contributions are collected the sum of money is ventured into business, every business turn over/profit will be reinvested in the business, and more so as to have produce more except for a 30% to be saved for future expansion or future unforeseen circumstances. 

The more production will have the more will have to increase the workers, and more we have to collect the street kids from streets to create them into a better powerhouse youth for economy. 

Business venture—— School children——Develop more skill —— more Jobs—— Increase Economy.

KEY NOTE: To you the partners and UNPD panel. If my project will not make it to the final, please be kind enough to just email me of how I will score and where I need to improve more. Why? I want to reach a level we’re will be sponsoring 2000 kids in secondary schools and 500 tertiary students in a year and create more than 1000 every year. So please be kind enough to just send the scores and an advise. emmanuelmungu23@gmail.com
