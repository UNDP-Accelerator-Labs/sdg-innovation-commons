> Title of the innovation

CASHEW PROCESSING AND PACKAGING MACHINE-Western province has 16 districts and cashew plantation and production was enhanced in 11 districts and hence the production output from both the old and new trees has increased .However, it is worth noting that the processors of cashew nuts are only found in Mongu leaving the other districts such as senanga without Buyers and processors. This Innovation concept will be buying cashew from the 7400 cashew farmers and processes it thus alleviating poverty and enhance job creation among the rural poor,

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is about creation of employment and increased incomes to the 7400 farmers who are involved into cashew nut production. it is worth noting that of all 11 districts where cashew nuts are grown, the processors and buyers are only found in Mongu District hence creating a serious marketing challenges for the farmers.
it is for this reason that our company wants to start buying cashew nuts from the farmers and start processing it and the by product will be sold for  feed making. 
The buyers of the cashew nut product includes the following, Shoprite,  choopies ,Local hotels and restaurants.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation is targeting the 7400 farmers of which 50 % are woman and 35% are youths. The organization will not only provide the market for the farmers in senanga but also  from the neighboring districts such as siona,shesheke, shangombo and others.
How it will work;
a) it will be buying the cashew nuts from the camps in the districts at the bulking centers established by the Cashew infrastructures Development project
b) it shall be processing the cashew nuts for some farmers or farmer group at a small fee.
c) The waste products from the kernels shall be sold to feed makers as a cake for feed processing, thus there is no environmental threats on climate change as there is no pollution to the environment.
it is worth noting that this business undertaking will reduce the pressure on the environment  caused by the charcoal burners as it is the major source of income thus causing serious deforestation.
d)There shall be value chain actors engaged locally thus boosting the local economic activities, For example the Transporters, Local hotels and restaurants ,roadside stockers and hawkers and on the larger scale the supermarkets such as Shoprite, choppers ,north mead supermarket, Pik N Pay,, and many other outlets in Lusaka and outside Zambia. 
e) The organization will also stock and bulk operating as both a processors and a bulker for off takers.1 Kg of raw cashew nut is ZMK 8.00 per Kg but when its processed its ZMK 150.00 per kg

> Technical Feasibility

This project is designed in such a way that once the processing machine such as the shelter is procured and the financing of the purchasing of raw cashew then the exercise commences.
The operational place for processing is there although, it is rented.
And in terms of the implementation plan refer below.
-purchasing of the Processing Equipment, the cashew nut Sheller.
-October -December-is the purchasing of the raw materials
-November -processing and packaging of cashew nuts
-November, December -Marketing ad Distribution of cashew to Shoprite,Choopers,  Norhtmead ,Lodges etc
N.B 30 Woman will be employed and 25 youths  directly and 2000 indirectly.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Western province poverty levels is around 80% and most of these are youths and women whose livelihood is mostly subsistence Agriculture. This value addition innovation will create 2055 jobs,30 Woman will be employed and 25 youths  directly and 2000 indirectly. It is worth noting that the transporters are part of the value chain actors and Agro shops for input suppliers such as pesticides for cashew nuts.
As the lives of small scale farmers improves ,there shall be less pressure on deforestation caused by charcoal burning which is the major activity here in senanga.
