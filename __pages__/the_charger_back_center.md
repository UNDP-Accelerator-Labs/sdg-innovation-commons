My name is Alpha Ibrahima Diallo, I deliver battery recharging services for traders in the port of Kamsar. It is true that for my age it can seem difficult to reconcile but as we can well mean it, the work ennobled and makes it possible to avoid certain derogatory situations especially for us of which most of the families have modest incomes. Here is in a few lines my experience in this battery recharging business.

Being a member of a modest family, I must always help my parents find a way that can be a relief for them with regard to the expenses related to the maintenance of my brothers and me. Thus, I hurry every afternoon to reach the port of Kamsar where the population is quite dynamic and made up of saleswomen, fish fishermen but also resourceful people like me. I run a battery recharging business there that serves as a safe haven for the phones of the above types of people.

To avoid the theft and / or loss of phones, I use a ticket coupling system, each with the number corresponding to that provided by the carrier of the phone. during the collection, he has the obligation to present it to me with the cost of the service, against which I deliver the telephone.

One of the reasons why many customers frequent me is that I provide them with a possibility of charging even in the event of a power cut from the sector and to do so, I use a 5 Kva motor (Tiger) for assure it.
