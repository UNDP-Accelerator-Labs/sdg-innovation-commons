The crowdfunding campaign was officially launched on 17 August 2023 in partnership with the Great Ethiopian Run (GER). The GER is a globally renowned road race organiser that comes into this crowdfunding campaign with a strong track-record in outreach around partnering with UNDP and
the rest of the UN to promote the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fundraise for local worthy causes. The Rebuild Her Business campaign will benefit from the “Running for Cause” charity initiative linked with the annual 10k race held in November 2023.

The Ethiopian Diaspora Trust Fund (EDTF) is an organization that creates a powerful connection between those in need in Ethiopia with the diaspora. Over the past 5 year, the fund has mobilized more than 7 million dollars from the Ethiopian diaspora around the world to support projects and dedicate a crisis relief to support the most vulnerable Ethiopians. Seeing the strategic alignment with Rebuild Her Business , EDTF has promoted the campaign with the diaspora community pledged to support 100 women through the Rebuild Her Business campaign with a $50,000 donation. The partnership is not only to support these women but to lay down a foundation for the future work with UNDP in the peace support projects.
