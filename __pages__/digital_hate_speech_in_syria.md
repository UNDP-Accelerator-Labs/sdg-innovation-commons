> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



“Our challenge is that digital hate speech in Syria has deeply permeated social media and online platforms, exacerbating sectarian, ethnic, political, gender-based, and area-based divisions. This widespread digital hate speech poses significant barriers to social cohesion, reconciliation, and peacebuilding efforts in the post-Regime era, making it a critical obstacle to the country’s recovery and the establishment of a stable, inclusive society.”



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The background of the challenge of digital hate speech in Syria is deeply rooted in the country’s recent history and the dynamics of its prolonged conflict. Here’s a detailed breakdown:



History and Drivers:

 • Conflict Onset: Digital hate speech in Syria gained momentum with the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, which began as part of the Arab Spring. This period marked a shift from peaceful protests to a violent civil war exacerbated by ethnic, religious, and political divisions.

 • Use of Digital Platforms: Various factions, including the Syrian government, opposition groups, extremist entities, and external influencers, have utilized social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to disseminate hate speech. These platforms became digital battlegrounds where competing narratives and inflammatory rhetoric targeted specific groups based on religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, gender, and geographic origin.



Contributing Factors:

 • Sectarian and Ethnic Divides: The conflict heightened existing sectarian and ethnic tensions, which were then amplified online. Digital platforms have been used to spread false narratives and incite violence, particularly targeting Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Kurdish, and Turkmen communities.

 • Political Manipulation: Digital spaces have also been exploited to attack political opposition, label dissenters as traitors or foreign agents, and manipulate public opinion.

 • Technological Proliferation: The widespread access to internet and social media in Syria, despite infrastructure challenges, has facilitated the rapid spread of hate speech.



Stakeholders Involved:

 • State Actors and Opposition: Both the Syrian government and various opposition factions have been involved in propagating digital hate speech.

 • Extremist Groups: Entities like ISIS have used digital platforms for recruitment and spreading their extremist ideologies.

 • International Actors: External countries and organizations have sometimes contributed to the spread of digital hate through support of various factions within Syria.

 • Tech Companies: Platforms that host user-generated content have been key venues for the dissemination of hate speech but also have a role in its moderation.



Current Situation:

 • Digital hate speech continues to be pervasive across Syria, with new narratives emerging in the post-Assad transitional phase. This speech remains a potent tool for social manipulation, contributing to ongoing instability and hindering peacebuilding efforts.



Undesired Effects:

 • Social Fragmentation: Hate speech has deepened the divisions within Syrian society, making reconciliation more challenging.

 • Violence and Displacement: Incitements to violence through digital hate speech have led to physical violence and displacement of communities.

 • Hindered Recovery and Governance: The pervasive nature of hate speech undermines efforts at governance and stabilization, as it continues to polarize the populace and disrupt efforts at building inclusive political and social systems.

Shifts in Narrative Post-Conflict: Observations of the digital landscape show a shift in hate speech narratives following the hypothetical fall of the Assad regime. This includes a transition from targeting opposition figures to vilifying former regime loyalists, indicating a volatile and shifting digital environment that can rapidly adapt to political changes, perpetuating cycles of hate and mistrust.



Emerging Trends in Digital Platforms: Weak signals include the adaptation of hate speech tactics, such as the use of memes, localized slang, and coded language on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, making it more challenging to moderate and detect. The sophistication of these methods shows an evolving challenge that requires equally sophisticated responses.



Community Responses and Resilience: Qualitative data from community feedback, as observed in digital forums and local responses, indicates varying degrees of resilience to hate speech. In some areas, community-led initiatives have started to push back against hate narratives, which serves as both a sign of hope and a call to support these grassroots efforts more robustly.
