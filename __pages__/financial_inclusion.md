New People at the table: Including Communities and informal business in an alternative Financial System


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge is focused on exploring financial inclusion and alternative financing modalities for development projects on community level. Can we combine them both , and can Islamic Finance be a possible mechanism methodology and framework to achieve this? 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Somali financial sector gradually come out from the informal style of functioning to a more formalized regulatory systems with the Central Bank of Somalia being established in 2009. Although Somalia has  no central monetary authority for upwards of 15 years between the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 and the subsequent re-establishment of the Central Bank of Somalia in 2009, the nation's payment system is actually fairly advanced due primarily to the widespread existence of private money transfer operators (MTO) that have acted as informal banking networks, while in the last couple of years, commercial banks are now playing an important role in the development of the nation’s payment system.

The present financial system comprises of Central bank (including in Somaliland), commercial banks, microfinance institutions (MFIs), money transfer businesses (MTBs), and mobile network operators (MNOs) providing mobile money services.

The financial system currently is dominated by Money Transfer Operators (MTO) and Mobile money networks, the penetration of the commercial banking is limited. only about 15 percent of the population as per 2017 data has a bank account, and less than 5 percent of people with bank accounts are active users(UNIDO). The situation for rural communities and people in different social segments are even worse in terms of them benefiting from access to any financial instruments.
