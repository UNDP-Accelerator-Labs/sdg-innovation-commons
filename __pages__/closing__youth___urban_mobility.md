## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Urban mobility is one of the many challenges youths are facing but not the priority. 2. Youth involvement in urban mobility is a result of a bigger challenge of unemployment. 3. Youth programming is chaotic with partners duplicating efforts and youth feeling that lack of robust M& E in youth programming contributes to lack of favourable outcomes. 4. Rural and urban settings predispose the youth to different challenges which demands innovation in creation and delivery of youth projects so that key challenges are addressed; one size fits all progamming needs to be re-evaluated.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Limited commitment from Ministry of Youth made it challenging to share learnings  Challenges with understanding the collective intelligence tools among partners resulted in misunderstanding the aim of the workshops and failure to translate findings into action.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose primary data because it provided most updated information in terms of existing youth programmes, attitude of the youth & stewards towards existing programmes, impact or lack of it, and solutions that the youth have, to make changes to existing challenges.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective intelligence and sensemaking helped us to bring together diverse groups of people from the youth, gatekeepers to program implementers therefore understanding the system from multiple angles.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Public Affairs Committee (PAC): jointly identified youth and gatekeepers to attend workshops. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Universities-LUANAR, Kuhes, MUST, UNIMA identify students to participate in the youth collective intelligence sessions, learn the approaches and share knowledge with their institutions.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

National youth council of Malawi (NYCOM)-jointly identified youth and gatekeepers to attend workshops   Ministry of Youth: provided technical expertise to guide the workshops so that the align to existing policies and frameworks.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

NYCOM: They are not a core part of Ministries and Departments that usually work with UNDP.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Working with NYCOM enabled us to reach youths that could otherwise not have been reached- we were able to combine youth from both rural and urban setting and representing different socio-economic backgrounds.
