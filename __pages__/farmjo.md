## Solution holder: Elham Al-taie, Na’ayem Al-mnasseer, Yahya Ali

An agricultural application and website to enrich farms through technology and support farmers by marketing their products and networking them with major markets and stores without cost, which increases production and increases income for farms. We also provide services, including insurance and delivery of agricultural supplies to farmers, in order to save time, effort and cost. Renting modern agricultural machinery with IOT technology, and to solve the water problem after the dams dried up, we added aquaponic cultivation, hydroponics, in order to rationalize water and increase production, noting that water production is twice the traditional production, and we started with hydroponics (in the research area).
