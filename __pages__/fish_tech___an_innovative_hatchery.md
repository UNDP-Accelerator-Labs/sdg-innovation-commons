About 0.42 million people are involved in shrimp post larvae collection along the estuaries and coastline of the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh recently Golda and Bolda shrimp have been been branded and the demand is rising. Traditional method in many hatcheries is mostly collecting brood from natural source followed by no testing in the lab. During a recent visit accelerator lab made to FishTech hatchery in Patuakhali, an innovative hatchery solution was identified that could be beneficial in large scale. These mechanisms involved lab testing, water quality testing, micro-scoping observation, pcr lab. They are also the first to introduce Zero feed in Bangladesh for rearing Golda shrimp.   Creating Specific Pathogen Tolerant Variety (SPT) Fish: Because of virus infestation, 82 hatcheries in Bangladesh were shut down. It was advised from the authority to create Specific Pathogen Tolerant Variety (SPF). However, SPF cannot be created in the first try, and requires the mother fish to go through the domestication process. So, Fishtech (BD) Limited started the domestication process.  A research pond was required to start the process. Availability of pond and opposition created by the pond owners delayed the whole process as the idea of bringing fish from 4-5 rivers was opposed. The fish must be parent fish, which needs to be cross bred to create F1, F2, F3, F4 generation of fish. The F4 generation becomes Specific Pathogen Tolerant Variety (SPT). The was in collaboration with WinRock and World Fish. Virus identification was done by Bangladesh Fish Research Center and Bagherhat Shrimp Center. Last year (2021) F1 generation was created with fish collected from 4 different rivers. They pla to start netting the F2 generation.
