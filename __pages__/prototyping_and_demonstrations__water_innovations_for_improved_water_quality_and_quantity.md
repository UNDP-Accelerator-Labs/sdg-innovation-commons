## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

13 March 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Inclusive Growth

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Water Security, small business development

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can local water innovations improve water quality and quantity

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Water Research Commission of South Africa
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

If local water innovations are developed and tested, then their state of readiness for commercial adoption can be improved. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

1. Can local water innovations improve water quality and water quantity

2. Can local water innovations be transformed into small businesses

> What is the object being tested?

7 local water innovations, ranging from those that can identify new groundwater sources, to those treating waste water and groundwater, and those optimising water use in aquaculture systems. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?

From August 2020 to August 2021. 

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

The technologies were assessed for technical functionality. As such no direct users were incorporated into the tests, however technical water experts were commissioned to objectivity assess the technology.   Data collection was done through laboratory analyses, machine learning, physical observation, comparison against known results and gold standard methods, 

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the resources required for this experiment?

Technical experts were required to assess innovations. Water experts advised on experimental designs. Financial resources were provided by UNDP and Dept of Science and Innovation.

## Review
**This section includes observations by peer reviewers**

> Reviewer's name

Not Available
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> What were the key results?

7 innovation were field tested - some of them have received scaling support. please refer to attached image for more information. 

> What were the key insights of this experiment?

Throughout the technology evaluation process, extensive knowledge and lessons were surfaced. This included techniques to improve experimental designs and logistical arrangements, how to manage partnerships as well as external influences, and how these can impact product development. To capture and share the rich knowledge emanating from the Water Innovation Challenge with other innovators and development practitioners, UNDP, together with WRC, Isle Utilities, Bosch Capital and Bosch Projects partnered to produce the UNDP-WRC Entrepreneurship Training Guide. The guide, developed with extensive inputs from the innovators about their experiences, seeks to provide early-stage entrepreneurs with business development support and assist developmental institutions better shape future innovation challenges to achieve greater impact. The guide also served as training material during a follow-up workshop for the seven innovators, where they were provided with expert guidance on how to move their businesses to the next developmental stage.  https://www.za.undp.org/content/south_africa/en/home/library/undp-wrc-entrepreneurship-training-guide.html 

> Any observations about the methodology?

Observations and learnings are captured here: https://www.za.undp.org/content/south_africa/en/home/library/undp-wrc-entrepreneurship-training-guide.html A workshop with the 7 innovators was also undertaken to share lessons learned and methods for improvement with them

> What was the total time it took to implement

1 year - experiments - 5 months for knowledge sharing product on lessons learned. 

> What was the approximate total budget used for the experiment (in US dollars)

$170 000 USD for the experiment and $30 000 USD for the knowledge product
