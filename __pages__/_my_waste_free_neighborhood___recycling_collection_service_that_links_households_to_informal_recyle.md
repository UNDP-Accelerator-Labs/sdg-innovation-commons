> Description

For this community recycling pilot (Mi Barrio sin Residuos), we connected a waste picker collective with households, protytping a regular weekly schedule of routes and household "clients" for members of the waste picker collective. The main effect we observed is that this interaction increased trust between them. This, in turn, opened interesting opportunities for knowledge transfer and growth, particularly, by further exploring how to establish and maintain engagement between participatory neighborhood institutions, such as neighbor’s commissions, and waste picker collectives.
