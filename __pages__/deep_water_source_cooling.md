> Type of the Solution

Innovative

> Description of the solution

It is a system in which cool water is pumped from a five-kilometer depth in Lake Ontario to participating office buildings and through metal coils. Fans blow the coils, into the buildings climate-control systems, reducing their energy demands. Although mostly used in cooler climates, it is also being explored in warmer areas.

> Other Notes

 Enwave Energy Corporation - The district cooling system of Toronto has a cooling power of 59,000 tons (207 MW). The system currently has enough capacity to cool 40,000,000 square feet (3,700,000 m¬≤) of office space.
