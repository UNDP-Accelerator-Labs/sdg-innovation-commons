## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to foster social cohesion along the Dominican Republic-Haiti border in order to promote peace dialogues and social inclusion actions, bringing a social innovation lens into the Dialogue Roundtables, civil society, authorities, and target populations to encourage dialogue and peace between the two nations. Our challenge is to explore conflict factors and areas of collaborative work where peace catalysts can be generated. Through different methodologies of collective intelligence and design thinking, the implementation of a social innovation lab in the border area on issues related to Human Rights, Gender Equality, Decent Work, and Decent Employment will allow for mapping, exploring, and experiencing emerging and relevant topics for border communities, assuming the challenge of catalyzing dialogue Roundtables and multidimensional actions for peace.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Dominican Republic and the Republic of Haiti share the island of Hispaniola, or Santo Domingo, in the Caribbean archipelago's center. Despite their close geographical proximity, the two countries have taken very different paths regarding human development, state organization, language, culture, and economic and social development. These distinctions are especially noticeable between border communities. Sporadic political and social dialogue differentiated socioeconomic relations, and a lack of operational spaces for conflict prevention and functional cohesion promotion have marked binational relations. However, economic, and socio-cultural interdependence is evident, given that Haiti is one of the Dominican Republic's main trading partners, with nearly 500,000 Haitian migrants living and working there. &nbsp; There are initiatives underway to improve binational cooperation and dialogue. On the one hand, at the national level, the ministries of foreign affairs and thematic ministries, via the Haitian-Dominican Bilateral Mixed Commission (CMBHD). The Commission was established in 1979 and relaunched in 1996 under a new institutional framework chaired by Foreign Ministers and with participation from the public and private sectors. Thus, the CMB is the instrument that channels political dialogue and guides partnership relations between the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It is the cornerstone of the two countries' highest-level cooperation mechanism. However, technical capacity, human and financial resources, and political support differ significantly between the CMB secretariats in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. &nbsp; In this context, UNDP and IOM are implementing the project "Strengthening Binational Dialogue between Haiti and the Dominican Republic to Promote Social Cohesion in the Border Area," with financial support from the General Secretariat's Peacebuilding Fund (PBF), with the primary goal of creating spaces for dialogue between the two nations as well as concrete actions for social inclusion in border area territories. One of the proposals outlined in the PBF project is establishing a social innovation lab pilot in the municipality of Dajabón.

Our AccLab has conducted qualitative research in Dajabón, one of the Dominican Republic's border and Haiti's municipalities. Our findings indicate that 1) the influence of contamination on the Massacre binational border river is caused by the people who live on the riverbank. 2) The socio-geopolitical issues of the binational market, a market of greater economic incidence of the municipality of Dajabon (Dominican Republic) and Ounaminthe (Haiti), ends up being a factor of high environmental and public space drift in the environment for both municipalities in both nations. 3) The natural capital is an essential socioeconomic dimension for the livelihood of the border’s inhabitants of both countries, especially the Massacre River, an asset of great value for life, production and economic sustainability. 4) The binational market requires management regulations to guarantee a dignified experience for migrant traders and clients from both countries. 5) The commercial activities of the binational market are one of the primary sources of contamination of the Massacre River. &nbsp;&nbsp; https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOUHOHJs=/ Link to the definition of the challenge through sensemaking.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our ultimate goal is to learn what can be effective in addressing identified binational social problems to generate social cohesion through the Lab’s building capacities by creating a social innovation lab in the field to identify social issues (including economic, political, environmental, etc.), develop new solution proposals, test their feasibility, and evaluate the results by the community.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Massacre River at the DR/Haiti border crosspoint in Dajabon is a significant water source for the northwestern region. A binational produce market operates at the crosspoint, increasing the negative environmental footprint on the river. The Social Innovation Lab is addressing collective solutions to plastic pollution and deficient SWM in the border area.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How could we ensure synergy between market governance, traders, customers, and the Massacre River in order to improve the experience and long-term value chain of the binational market and the Massacre River, thereby creating a sense of belonging and social cohesion between the two municipalities through essential factors that affect each other?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These methods allow us to obtain an understanding of the problem from and from the people, in order to build ideas for experimentation that people can appropriate and be part of, generating cohesion from the research and analysis of the situation, to provide knowledge as a whole rather than extraction.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We require information regarding the flow and movement of people in the binational market, as well as products suitable for sale, commercialization, and traceability. We also need data on waste generation from the market and waste that reaches the Masacre River, as well as data on environmental damage to the Masacre River, its factors, and the frequency of tree felling. This data will assist us in generating social cohesion through environmental awareness and experiencing data-driven behavioral changes.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This learning cycle is being worked on with IOM and the Peace Building Funds (PBF). If the experiments and methodologies are successful, they could be used to generate guidelines for social cohesion through innovation and experimentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
