Jack Oyugi, founded Biofit Agritech, a company that harnesses the invasive water hyacinth and converts it into an animal food supplement. The invasive weed which first appeared in Africa in the early 1900s made its way to Lake Victoria where it has closed off fishing routes and provided a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes.

The water hyacinth is steam boiled, dried, crushed and fermented to make a powder, which is then mixed with minerals and energy-rich materials like maize bran to make an affordable feed sold at a fraction of the price of soya feed. The byproducts from making the feed can also be sold as fertilizers. The company employs the fishermen as harvesters as they can no longer fish because the hyacinth levels are so high.
