> Title of the innovation

Kumwitu , meaning home in Mambwe.

> Brief description of the innovation

Kumwitu is a word I came up with, meaning home in Mambwe. I would love to venture into agriculture, to be able to grow local foods such as, beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, ground nuts, soya beans, different types of vegetables and be able to rare chickens. I would love to own a farm in kabwe, being the center of central province and be able to help the locals in fighting child malnutrition which is very common there due to lack of affordable and well balanced meals.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Running a farm would mean me hiring farm worker to help with it's operation, and with what we will grow and sell, we will be able to put our selves on a salary. That income would give us un opportunity to provide for our families. Our produce will be supplied to the locals at an affordable price to also give them an opportunity to cell and make profit out of there business, thereby improving their lives.

> Technical Feasibility

This is something i have just been thinking of and wanting to do, I don't have much knowledge about agriculture but would really love to learn, research and become a good and big agriculturist. I don't have any income to start up my dream yet, but hoping to see my self achieve it some day.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My plan is to be able to empower the people I will work with through teaching them on how to save and different life skills.be able to start up their own business of interest. I plan to do this by keeping 40% of their monthly income for a period of 1 year,  then at the end of the year sit down with them and  help them start their own business. There after help them grow their business through continuous teaching and evaluation.
