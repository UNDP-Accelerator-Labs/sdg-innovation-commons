The concept of AgroPhotovoltaic (AgroPV or Solar Farming) utilises the unused space under large-scale PV arrays for agricultural purpose. As such, the construction cost is negligible or at minimum due to the optimisation of existing infrastructure of PV farms. In AgroPV farms, PV arrays for electricity production are installed directly above crop covering. PV facilities can protect the plants from severe weather patterns such as drought and storm. 

The installation of the Retractable Drying and Planting Rack for AgroPhotovoltaics Farm can provide the following benefits:
- no additional cost for PV structure
- monetary surplus for the unused land
- low cost with high grade materials
- easy installation and operation
- green innovation with Nexus Integration
