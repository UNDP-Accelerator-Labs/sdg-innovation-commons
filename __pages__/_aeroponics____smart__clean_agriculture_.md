> Brief description of the innovation

"Aeroponics"- Smart, Clean Agriculture! Is an innovation which utilizes the use of a smart, resource efficient, easy and clean soilless agriculture system called aeroponics.  Aeroponics is a system of farming where the crops are grown in containers, the roots of the growing crops are not supported by anygrowth medium, they are simple suspended in air. The crop's  growth is supported by a nutrient solution supplied directly to their root zone. Despite the fact that the innovation is not native to Zambia, it's adoption by our farmers and home garderners, especially those in urban areas with poor soil fertility, limited water supply and limited bare land to be used for crop growth will be a massive advantage. Through this innovation, they will be able to produce crops all year round, this is so because the aeroponics systems of agriculture is set up in such a way that planting does not depend on the presence of rain, it can be set up any where in any season of the year. This innovation will definitely assure it's users;  improved crop growth, quality and yield.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We are going to be selling a fixed aeroponics kit which both commercial and home garderners can easily assemble and use for their crop growth. The kit will also include fertilizer programs for different crops to help our customers start up correctly and maintain good crop growth. We are also going to be offering aeroponics farming consultations. Income wi therefore be generated from the profits we will be making as we deliver the aeroponics kit and Consultation services to our customers .
Our target market will be all kinds of Farmers and crop growers interested in adopting the aeroponics technique. Specifically; home gardeners as well as commercial and small scale farmers.
The use of this innovation will result into reduced environmental pollution die to reduced dependence on synthetic chemicals for pest and disease control on plants. And, due to the all year round growth of crops, there will be an increase in carbon sequestration by plants. The innovation is therefore one important strategy of adopting to and mitigating climate change.

> Technical Feasibility

Our basic aeroponics system which will be a buildup of the current prototype shown in this application, will consist of; plastic containers to be used as the crop's growth chamber, a nutrient solution to be supplied onto the crop's root zone , water pipes through which the nutrient solution will be passing, a pressure pump to help supply pressure to the nutrient solution as it moves through the pipes, sprayer nozzles/ sprinkler heads which will be connected to the pipes and thus help in the direct delivery of the nutrients and water to the crop  roots and lastly, a nutrient reservoir and recycle container to help recycle and store the nutrient solution, for efficient use of nutrients and water .
The first step towards the implementation of our innovation will be done by carrying out a training or call for awareness to our potential customers, educating them about the aeroponics system of agriculture and it's benefits to man , the environment and the nation at large. From there we will supply our aeroponics kits directly and indirectly  to our customers through agro shops and we will work with NGOs and the ministry of agriculture which will help us in creating more awareness about the innovation with the aim if increasing household and small scale farmers use of the innovation

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is the prayer of every Crop producer to have a stress free crop growth and most importantly improved and increased crop quality and yield.  The use of aeroponics technology by farmers here in Zambia will most definitely result into an increased crop yield which will also result into increas d income / profit when ever the produce is sold. The better the quality of the produce , the more the revenue one is expected to have after sells. Further more, this innovation will also improve the health of the people consuming the produce, in that, crops produced through the system have high nutrient content due to the direct access of nutrients and water by the plant roots through the nutrient solution.
Considering the unpredictable climate change, challenges with conventional agriculture and reduction in arable land, agriculture crop production has been negatively  affected resulting into instability if food supply and availability on the market . This has as a result affected the pricing of food on the market. The use of this innovation will help bring about an increase in food availability on the market, which will positively affect food pricing , making it easier for all households to afford buying food. Hence improving food security both at house hold and national level.
