Digitally Enabled Livelihoods Portfolio
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

We take on the challenge of supporting green MSMEs to make their boldest digital move, and at the same time touch on digital inclusion, alternative finance, misinformation, future of the work skills and mobile-enabled financial inclusion and assistive tech. We action-research how the digital transformation works in underserved and low-literacy settings (Digital Inclusion), how mobile could present countless opportunities to reverse growing inequalities and foster green growth (Mobile Money and Assistive Tech) and how to repair and rebuild to better the value chains damaged by the pandemic or the underlying inability to compete (Future-Proofing Jobs and Grassroots-driven Regeneration).

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

MSMEs and cooperatives, which contribute most to Morocco’s GDP and generate most of the livelihoods, have been the hardest hit by COVID-19 crisis because of their higher levels of vulnerability and lower resilience of the most vulnerable population. UNDP Morocco is currently supporting hundreds of micro-enterprises with digital skills and tools and has learnt how they struggle to survive and access markets opportunities, let alone to make their much-needed transition to more climate-resilient and digital economy structures. According to ILO (October 2020) long term inactivity is rising faster than unemployment making it much hard to restore most of the lost jobs than to reemploy unemployed people. Energizing the local economy requires much more than a cut-and-paste approach to digital transformation, it  is about developing new opportunities for small businesses to create future-proof jobs and most importantly to co-design bottom-up solutions. The pandemic has shed a harsh light on the digital divide: people living in remote rural areas, vulnerable groups, and those with low socioeconomic status generally have less or no access to information technologies. Evidence shows that people living in the lower spectrum of income tend to spend more to meet their basic needs since low-income families are faced with much less choices and often have to borrow to make ends meet. Digital inclusion could help reverse this tendency.   The European Union accounts for more than 58% of Moroccan exports, 59% of the stock of Foreign Direct Investment FDI, 70% of tourism receipts, and 69% of remittances from Moroccans living abroad (MRE). The The Moroccan economy is therefore extremely intertwined with the EU economy and underwent many ripple effects as a result of the European economic contraction. Some of the latter are already being felt, including the slow down in agriculture (aggravated by two consecutive years of drought), tourism, handicrafts, food processing, automotive, and textile industries. The informal sector, which officially contributes about 20% of Morocco’s GDP[1] and employs more than 2.273 million people, has been particularly hard hit. Mass layoffs and closures started just a few weeks into the crisis. Most micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) were caught unprepared and financially fragile, without the necessary skills to adapt their business model to the new circumstances. Although the socio-economic impact is still unfolding, figures already indicate that more than 300,000 Moroccan companies registered with the National Social Security Fund (CNSS, Caisse nationale de sécurité sociale) stopped their activities during the lockdown period which resulted in more than 900,000 registered employees claiming compensation. A recent study by "Info Risk" revealed a significant decline, by up to 40 percent, in the transactions of MSMEs with 10 or fewer employees. MSMEs have been struggling with extremely reduced liquidity, disrupted supply chains, and lending challenges. To bounce back stronger, they will need to re-imagine their business models and find their place and role in the new normal.  In that transformation, embracing new technologies and going digital can help make small businesses in the informal economy more efficient.   [1] https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/07/covid-19-to-add-as-many-as-150-million-extreme-poor-by-2021 [2] according to a recent study by the Confédération Générale des Enterprises du Maroc CGEM [3] National Survey High Commission for the HCP 2013-2014 Plan

According to the latest ILO report in 29 janvier 2021, the risk of job loss in the informal sector in Morocco is very high because of its vulnerability to shocks. The informal economy workforce, with at least 4.3 million people, represents almost 39% of the employed labor force. It is mainly used in local activities. In addition to agricultural production and part of artisanal fishing, informal jobs are concentrated in processing, marketing of food products, local catering, art and service crafts, building trades, trade. , repair, road transport and personal services. The economic units accommodating this labor force are fragile and assessed at their dis-aggregation in the event of a drop in activity and income due to the decrease in demand. The informal economy has not received specific aid aimed at safeguarding its productive potential. The shock of the confinement on the income of the self-employed was severe in urban areas, including 38% 19.

During COVID-19, Moroccan have had to rapidly adapt to new realities where – attending school, working, socializing and shopping in different ways. Most of these new ways rely on digital technologies to create new value and models. Even though digital payments, digital skills and doing business online are distinctively lagging in Morocco, grassroots innovations such as Cash on delivery models have seen a huge spike along with Instagram/WhatsApp based shopping orders that have been quickly mushrooming in unexpected places. GSMA latest Innovation Landscape Research in December 2020 featured Morocco as one of the 33 countries in Africa and Asia where no locally developed solutions could be identified. Although, there seem to be nothing happening yet in this space, we read this research with a lot of interest and followed through, since then, Its finding as a weak signal for addressing the need for locally relevant digital ATs that meet the range of needs of people with disabilities in Morocco.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Challenges (and Some Solutions) in Creating a   The pandemic has been surfacing preexisting inequalities and even more so exposes the widening digital divide in Morocco. The economic downturn has uprooted local business models and caused a multidimensional shock on MSMEs and informal subsistence businesses whose disappearing incomes are trapping them back into bleak living conditions. And if digital transformation seems inevitable for a regenerative recovery, untangling its complexity and its many facets require us to venture into uncharted territories. For instance, some of our specific main goals are to: 1. Discover strategies for halting and reversing the ever-increasing digital divide from an economic development lever. 2. Understand how Mobile Money offerings and taxation are integrated to impact behavioral responses of women microentrepreneurs. 3. Strengthen the ecosystem, not only individual MSMEs and create linkages with academia, UN sister agencies and research bodies. We use a large range of state-of-the-art tools, some of which are: behavioral insights, foresight, rapid ethnography, citizen science, digital ledger technologies and system thinking analyses.

We are trying to create a network of digital ambassadors and further understand the challenges of MSMEs while providing opportunities for local enthusiastic nerds who support to overcome the digital divide. The tasks of the Digital Ambassadors are derived from the concrete needs on site to be able to actively shape the digital transformation at a granular level. They engage with vulnerable groups at a deep and empathetic level. Vulnerable groups may have had fewer opportunities to use digital technologies and develop basic skills for any number of reasons, such as cost, age, social norms and expectations, physical ability, awareness, geography, level of education, or language spoken
