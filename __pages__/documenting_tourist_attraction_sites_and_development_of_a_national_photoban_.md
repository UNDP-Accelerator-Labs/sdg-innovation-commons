## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Documenting Tourist Attraction Sites and Development of a National Photobank
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that many heritage sites and other tourist attraction sites have not been documented and marketed to promote both domestic and international tourism as well to attract investment for sustainable tourism 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Lesotho's tourism impediments include infrastructure inadequacy, low levels of tourism collaborations and investment. It is also notable that the sector lacks proper legal framework and natural resources governance including heritage sites as well as protected areas.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The AccLab wishes to document tourist attraction sites with specific focus to those that have not been explored. Documenting these sites will open new avenues of economic activities and further work as a platform for building new tourism products and services in these areas. This documentation will also assist in the promotion of domestic travel and assist the Lesotho’s tourism sector recover from the adverse effect of COVID-19.

With the awareness of scenic views that exist within communities, it is believed that tourism will be seen as an income generating sector. Communities will appreciate the attraction sites in their neighborhoods as they receive more visitors due to the exposure they receive.
