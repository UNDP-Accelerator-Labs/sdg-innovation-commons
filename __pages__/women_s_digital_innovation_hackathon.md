Technology is becoming increasingly ingrained in people’s daily lives, with 90% of future jobs requiring digital skills. Despite its potential to empower women, technology careers are enmeshed with existing gender inequality, hindering women’s participation in the production, management, and use of technology. In this context, in line with UNDP Accelerator Lab’s Mission of reducing the Gender Digital Divide and increase female representation in the Bangladesh’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Space, an all-women digital hackathon was organized in July 2021. The Accelerator Lab’s women’s digital innovation hackathon aimed to promote ICT skills and innovation to female students and young professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of social problems, that can be piloted within the Accelerator lab network to address key development challenges of Bangladesh. While it was organized as a competition, the aim was to offer encouragement and learning opportunities to the participants. The Hackathon had two Challenge Tracks: Digital Transformation & Smart City. There was 200+ applications submitted. The top 3 teams of each Hack received funding to grow their innovative solutions after the event, with the Gold award being worth $1500 USD plus scholarships to Edx’s professional certificate series in deep learning and fintech, silver award being $1000 USD and Bronze award being $500 USD. All participants will receive scholarships to University of Helsinki and Reaktor’s “Elements of AI” online course. The Hackathon was carried out partnerships with Women in Digital, UNLEASH Innovation Lab, Reaktor, University of Helsinki, and UltraHack.
