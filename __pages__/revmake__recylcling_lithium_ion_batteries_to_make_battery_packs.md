> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Steven Kavuma.

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

Kawala Kampala Mobile +256 774540865 Email: steven.revmake@gmail.com

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

No

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Repurposing lithium-ion batteries to make energy pack that stores energy. It addresses the problem of poor disposal of batteries that affect the environment and the limited access to energy. &nbsp; They make portable battery packs and power banks from recycled lithium-ion batteries.

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback
Unable to obtain end-user feedback link

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The Power bank can charge phones for upto 2weeks while the Laptop Power Back can charge the laptop up 5days

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Collecting the used Lithium-ion batteries from the landfills is complicated since there's no systemic way of dispossing off tech-related gadgets that are nolonger working.
