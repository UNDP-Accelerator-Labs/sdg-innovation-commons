> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

This solution consists of a solar water heater that can be built with traditional materials that are available at any hardware store or sanitary house. It is possible to assemble it in the course of a morning by following the instructions in the simple technology manual written by the work team. The water heater heats up to 80 liters of water per day and costs about a third of the value of a commercial water heater, which runs on gas. Although it does not have the same efficiency, it is an economical alternative to provide a family with hot water that is not suitable for drinking. “They are low-cost solar collectors with simple technology. The fundamental aspect is that anyone can assemble them, and thus they do not have to spend 12 or 15 thousand pesos on a water heater from the market”.

The water heater heats up to 80 liters of water per day and costs about a third of the value of a commercial water heater, which runs on gas. Although it does not have the same efficiency, it is an economical alternative to provide a family with hot water that is not suitable for drinking. “They are low-cost solar collectors with simple technology. The fundamental aspect is that anyone can assemble them, and thus they do not have to spend 12 or 15 thousand pesos on a water heater from the market”. These devices can provide energy to 4 or 5 people.
