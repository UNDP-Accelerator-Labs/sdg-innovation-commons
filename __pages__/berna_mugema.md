## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

What is the most appropriate tariff to encourage conversion to electric cooking by large biomass consumption institutions like hospitals

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF institutions had access to affordable robust energy saving solutions, THEN their consumption of biomass/wood fuel would significantly reduce and trigger a reversal in the rate of deforestation

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

In this experiment, we will measure the energy consumption in terms of biomass for the unit as well as the carbon emissions, the time taken to prepare meals and the associated costs to form a baseline.
we will then create a temporary kitchen for continuity of activities
We will isolate the unit and give it is own power supply and metering units
we will then partially demolish , reconstruct and retrofit the kitchen with electric equipment
We will install monitoring units to ensure we can monitor power consumption
we will get an approval for a test cooking tariff that will be applied

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

energy consumption

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data on the consumption of biomass will be collected by observation, interviews and past financial records,
Data on electricity consumption will be collecting using specialized monitoring equipment.
Observation and in depth interviews will also be conducted.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 1

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
