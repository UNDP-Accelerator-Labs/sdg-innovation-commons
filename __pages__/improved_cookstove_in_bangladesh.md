In Bangladesh, as a source of cooking fuel, wood is used which is leading to deforestation. 1991 to 2011 the use of wood reduced only 9.47%  (Source: socio economic census, BBS)


In this scenario, Social Assistance & Rehabilitation for the Physically Vulnerable (SARPV)'s Improved Cook Stove (ICS) is helping reduce the use of fuel wood that is savings many trees.
