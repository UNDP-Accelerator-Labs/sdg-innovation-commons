## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

- Government changes disrupts learning cycles and knowledge built.
- The citizens perceptions of public space use and needs were understood from the exploration phase.
- There is no global maintenance of public spaces from either government or public, which leads to deterioration of the same.
- Consolidation of solutions and outputs were difficult to put together due to the number of Ministries and partners involved - causing significant delays. 
- There is no consolidated agreement on the use of the space which means it ended up being used for economic activity, illicit gambling and growing of crops. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

This learning cycle began with exploring the existing public spaces in Guinea-Bissau namely 3: Green Space, Jardim da Alfandega and Airport. Our findings were presented to the Bissau Council and solutions were proposed. After testing, the results were also presented with aims of bringing together the different interested Ministries and parties to implement the solutions as a form of scale up. Although a solution was not consolidated amongst those involved, the Bissau Council conducted elaborate building works in the Airport and the Jardim da Alfandega, both of which they garnered results from our exploration and testing.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



- Interviews: To obtain the in depth opinions formulated by the users of the public spaces. 


There was no available data in this realm of public spaces. 


> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- Collective Intelligence: To have a collective perception that citizens and institutions have in relation to the public spaces. 
- Design Thinking: To ensure that the process was user-led, based on their experiences and use of the public spaces to ensure sustainability. 


They are both effective methods to sense, explore and test what the population feels and experiences in relation to the public spaces.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

If it were not for the innovative methodologies engaged in this learning cycle we would not have a true perception of the citizens experience of using the space in order to be able to synthesize and come up with solutions and test that were later adopted by the Bissau Council and applied in different locations for betterment of public space and usage in Bissau. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
