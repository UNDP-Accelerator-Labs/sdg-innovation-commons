> Description of the solution

Hospitals need to prepare for a large influx of patients during heat events, which exceed typical daily admission rates. Thye may also have to change their layouts so that those patients most threatened by heat are accomodated in coolerparts of the building. For example, in a hospital in Ahmedabad, India, the maternity ward was on the fourth and reportedly, hottest floor. After a heatwave in May 2021, the ward was relocated to the ground floor where it is much cooler. Analysis of this shift indicates that it had  a protective effect with fewer heat-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Carondelet Health Network - In a state like Arizona, a large hospital group consisting of several hospitals can split the cost of having equipment on the ready. 
Arrange contract service agreements with the regional utility provider for all the hospitals oversees. For the facilities, regional utility provide can electively switch to generator mode to mitigate brownouts until the grid is stabilized. Such an arrangement ultimately benefits the health care system, the community served and the utility provider. In doing so, we remove some load from the grid and this helps the provider sustain the electrical network and keep everyone‚Äôs air conditioners on.
