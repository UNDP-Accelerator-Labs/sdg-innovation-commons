Nailde Lopes, used her knowledge of food and experience as a doctor to create a business which focusses on health eating of clients of the national hospital Simão Mendes. The canteen works in collaboration with the doctors of the hospital, to produce meals that correspond with the symptoms/conditions of the patients. Nailde was the winner of the Accelerator Lab entrepreneurship competition, and some of the feedback she got was that she should work on developing her business, especially on working with a nutritionist and going beyond providing generic meals.
