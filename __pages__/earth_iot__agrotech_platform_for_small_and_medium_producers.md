Earth-IoT is an agrotech platform that allows farmers to track their harvest, save on production inputs and share information with agricultural and financial advisors for easy access. Unlike other foreign companies in the sector, the platform is designed to be inclusive of small and medium-sized producers, not just large producers, being cheaper and using simpler language, in addition to allowing access to recommendations and personalized follow-up.
