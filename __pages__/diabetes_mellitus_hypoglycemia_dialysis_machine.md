> Title of the innovation

Diabetes Mellitus Hypoglycemia Dialysis Machine

> Brief description of the innovation

This machine can replace insulin used by Diabetic patients. It can remove excess glucose from a Diabetic patient by the simple process of diffusion and transfer it to a patient with less glucose which is the Hypoglycemic patient. The above image shows the theoretical model of the machine, I would like to introduce this machine in hospitals here in Zambia and the world at large.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We have a lot of Diabetic patients in Zambia and the World at large, this machine can generate a lot of income for my country and I as it can be more effective than the current methods being used to treat Diabetic patients. It cannot only generate income for my country and I because I need man power but it would also improve the well being of the people. This machine would not pollute the environment in any way but it would recycle all the unwanted glucose from the Diabetic patients. According to the information I have gathered from my former Biology teachers and health personnel's this machine wouldn't have any side effects if
handled properly.

> Technical Feasibility

This machine is designed like the kidney dialysis machine except for its function, the kidney machine removes urea while this machine will be able to remove excess glucose using the same concept. The machine will have dialysis fluid which will comprise of all micro buffers, nutrients, water and glucose in their right proportions, as the blood of the Diabetic patient passes through the semi permeable membrane tube the excess glucose diffuses into the dialysis fluid. Through the dialysis fluid the excess glucose in transported to the other chamber, as the blood of the Hypoglycemic patient passes through the semi permeable membrane tube it absorbs the excess glucose through diffusion and the process continues until the fluid and the blood of both patients equalises or become isotonic. As the blood of the two patients passes through the tube anticoagulants are applied and as the blood goes back to their bodies it passes through the air trapper to avoid air embolism in the lungs of the patients.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This machine can greatly improve the lives of Diabetic patients especially those in critical condition such as coma as it removes the excess glucose causing harm to their bodies direct from the blood which more effective.
