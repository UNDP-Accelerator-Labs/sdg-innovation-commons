> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

the costs can range between $1000 and $1200

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

It is currently at testing phase and has been used by the user for about 5 years now with success

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

So far the solution has so far been by one homestead, but the plan was to diffuse it to one other community when COVID 19 hit and all plans were halted. The solution has received positive feedback from the user as she has been using it consistently for the past 5 years. it has reduced the need for her to collect fuel wood as she lives alone and can nolonger walk long distances.&nbsp;

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

No calculations to estimate this have been undertaken. However, 75% of Swazis in rural areas are dependent of wood energy for cooking, and this technology, if widely diffused, can result in major reduction in the dependence on wood fuel use. the costs saved would not only be in monetary terms but would have to take into account the time savings for women, who often have to walk long distances and spend hours collecting this energy source.&nbsp;&nbsp;

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

The are no known cross border bottlenecks that can affect the diffusion of this solution. However, locally, one organisation (The Renewable Energy Association of Eswatini) that has tried to pilot the solution on a larger scale has reported some challenges in doing so. These include&nbsp;
