Territorial brand for Chernobyl recovering areas 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to promote the development the Chernobyl territories using new narratives and storytelling to change the societal perceptions of the regions. We focus on making these regions attractive for investors, SMEs and bankable projects as well as supporting development of local human potential.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



 Support for the territories of Belarus affected by the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is one of the priorities of the work of the UN country team. The importance of the development of the Chernobyl regions is enshrined in the Resolution of the UN General Assembly of December 16, 2019 on cooperation to mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.

Since 1986, international organizations, donors, the private sector, and civil society organizations have supported the restoration of the affected areas and the population living in these territories. During this time, with the support of UN agencies in Belarus, more than 80 large-scale projects and programs for restoration and development were implemented for a total amount of more than 70 million US dollars. Only the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), over the past five years, together with national and international partners, has implemented 68 initiatives in the affected areas worth about 5.85 million US dollars.

The development of economic potential contributes to the effective restoration of the Chernobyl territories. Positioning the region, which help remove the stigma of "affected" and "unsafe" territory, will allow local business entities (including social entrepreneurs) to enter new markets for their products.

In May 2023, the Lab conducted an exploratory mission to the Brahin and Khoiniki districts. Findings include: 

1.Local SMEs and executive committees confirmed the importance and necessity of debiasing the Chernobyl’s regions production. Negative perception of products on internal and external markets hinders entrepreneurship development and negatively effects on sustainability. According to the local community, holding an information campaign that will demonstrate the quality, safety, traditions of the region's products will contribute to addressing these challenges;

2. Bragin and Khoiniki executive committees are interested and ready to implement initiatives on  destigmatization of Chernobyl regions’s producs. Piloting new mechanisms will strengthen the local business initiative and create conditions for the local export.

3. Local authorities and Republican Association of wheelchair users noted the effectiveness and crucial role of UNDP’s support for vulnerable groups in the Chernobyl regions. Involvement of PWD and other vulnerable groups (rural women, elderly people, youth) to economic activities and entrepreneurship  ensures their access to sustainable livelihoods.
