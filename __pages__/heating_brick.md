Heating brick

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Every day, between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. in winter, Casavalle has low voltage. If you want to plug something in, the thermal keys get off. This is because there are many people who are hanging from the electric lines.

 

Even garbage trucks often do not pass because the cables are low, and that is because people hang from the line. It is a vicious cycle of poverty.

 

5 teenagers from Casavalle (a very low-income neighborhood in Montevideo) decided to create something that could help everyone. They created a heating system using wind energy with materials that are easily accessible. Fan propellers, washing machine pumps and fire bricks. The energy comes from the wind that makes the fan blades spin rapidly; behind the paddles the washing machine pump is connected. This washing machine pump can be removed from any that is in disuse. A cable is connected from the pump that transmits the energy to a shielded resistance (it is found inside the electric jugs). Finally, the resistance is embedded within a firebrick.

The idea is that the brick is part of the structure of the house and that all this installation goes outside the houses, because today there is a risk in precarious houses that the resistances above the bricks set everything on fire.

 

Whit this brick, the house can be heat in a very cheap way and accessible.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

1- The cold of the winter in precarious houses.  
2-People  hanging from the electric lines.
3- Garbage trucks often do not pass

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

The energy and the disposition of the people who live in the neighborhood that wants to find solutions is very great.
