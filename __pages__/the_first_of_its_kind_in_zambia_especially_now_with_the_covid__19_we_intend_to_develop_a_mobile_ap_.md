> Brief description of the innovation

We intend to develop a mobile application to enable us deliver these services online. The Keycon concept primary goal is to enable citizen seek medical advice by calling a Doctor and consult without leaving the comfort of their homes or offices.  
Call –A -Doctor will be an App-based membership that will provides the peace of mind that you will always have access to a doctor when you need one, 24/7. Members will access home visits, telephone advice or clinic appointments quickly and easily. Call –A -Doctor will look after individuals, families and organisations.
Doctor Video appointments will be a great way to speak to a doctor about any healthcare concern without having to attend a clinic or GP surgery.
Our doctors will speak to you via our app using your mobile phone camera, much like a video call.

Keycon Health Solutions (KHS) offers a carefully selected range of healthcare products and services to complement clinic services. We intend to develop a mobile application to enable us deliver these services online. 
The Keycon concept primary goal is to enable citizen seek medical advice by calling a Doctor and consult without leaving the comfort of their homes or offices.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Membership fees
Membership provides you with medical cover when you need it, with a rapid and efficient route to the top hospitals and medical experts when required and with cost-effective healthcare either at home or in clinic.  

Calling a Doctor membership will cost K2,500 per year, a fraction of the cost of private medical insurance.
