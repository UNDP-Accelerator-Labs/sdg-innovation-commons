INCREASING PRODUCTION FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH MINI MILLING PLANT

> Brief description of the innovation

MOST SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN ZAMBIA ARE FOUND IN THE RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND I AM PRIVILEGED TO BE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS 40 KM AWAY FROM THE BOMA AND AFTER IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES WHICH SMALL SCALE FARMERS FACE, WE HAVE PLANS TO BE IN AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING BUSINESS VENTURE THAT WILL INCLUDE INNOVATION ACTIVITIES IN MINI MILLING PLANT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES OF ZAMBIA, WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED LOCAL AND NATIONAL CLIENT BASE. THE MINI PLANT SHALL DELIVER PROCUREMENT AND MILLING OF GRAIN PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION, LIVESTOCK AND FISH FARMING CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO INTEND TO OFFER CONSULTANCY AND ADVISORY SERVICES ON AGRICULTURE AND METEORLOGICAL INFORMATION RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND SMART AGRICULTURE TO LOCAL FARMERS. 
TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL AND NATIONAL BUSINESS EXPANSION AMBITION, WE HAVE REGISTERED WITH PACRA ( REGISTRATION NUMBER: 320190009279) AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION INVESTMENT IN THIS BUSINESS BY INSTALLING A MINI MILLING PLANT COMPRISING A HAMMER MILL, MAIZE DEHAULLER AND A SUNFLOWER/SOYBEAN OIL PROCEESSING MACHINE WHICH WE BELIEVE IT WIL INCREASE PRODUCTION FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS. LATER WE ARE ALSO INTENDING TO CONSTRUCT A STANDARD FISH POND. 
AS FOR NOW, START-UP FUNDING IS SOUGHT PRINCIPALLY TO PROVIDE INNOVATION WORKING CAPITAL FOR MINI MILLING PLANT FOR LOCAL RURAL COMMUNITY EXPANSION PROJECT AT MILLION VILLAGE, CHIEF LUEMBE - NYIMBA DISTRICT, EASTERN PROVINCE WHICH WE BELIEVE IT WILL ENABLE US TO DEVELOP THE AGRICULTURE AND METEOROLOGICAL (Agro-Met) BUSINESS DELIVERY CAPABILITIES, AND ACCESS NEW LOCAL AND NATIONAL BASED MARKETS. 
THIS INNOVATION EXPANSION PROJECT WILL INVOLVE US IN WORKING CLOSELY WITH SPECIALIST NATIONAL SALES, MARKETING AND agro-Met CONSULTANTS TO UNDERTAKE COMPHREHENSIVE MARKET RESEARCH AND BUILD SUCCESSFUL DOMESTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH RETAILERS AND PARTNERS. WE SHALL ALSO INVEST IN MARKETING ACTIVITY IN NEW MARKETS WHEN THE BUSINESS GROWS.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1. INCOME GENERATION
a). THROUGH MAIZE MEAL, GRITS AND BRAN CHARGES 
b). THROUGH SUNFLOWER, GROUNDNUTS AND SOYBEANS COOKING OIL CHARGES
c).  THROUGH SUNFLOWER, GROUNDNUTS AND SOYBEANS CAKE CHARGES.
d).  THIS INNOVATION WILL ASSIST IN IMPROVING OPERATIONS OF EXISTING BUSINESS THROUGH THE BY-PRODUCTS (CAKES) THAT WILL BE USED TO MAKE FISH, CHICKEN AND ANIMAL FEEDS OR ORGANIC FERTILIZER FOR GARDERNING  
2. TARGET MARKET/POTENTIAL OFFTAKERS
a). LOCAL FARMERS
b). HOUSEHOLDS
c). RESTAURANTS AND CANTEENS
d). ANIMAL FEED MILLING PLANTS
e). STUDENTS
f). ANIMAL FEED BUSINESSES
g). EVERYBODY IN OUR TARGET LOCATION
3. HOW WILL THE CHALLENGE PRIZE GOING TO HELP THE BUSINESS GROW
THIS WILL HELP BUSINESS THROUGH THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND FEATURES OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY THAT WILL INCLUDE PACKAGING OF PRODUCTS IN DIFFERENT SIZES THAT WILL MEET EACH CUSTOMER'S DEMAND. IT IS ALSO GOING TO HELP THE BUSINESS GROW THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF NEW EQUIPMENT FOR ANIMAL FEEDS MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION OF STANDARD FISH POND AS THE BUSINESS GROWS
4. THE VALUE ADDITION OF THE INNOVATION ON ENVIRONMENT
OUR BUILDING DESIGN AND STRUCTURE FOR MACHINERY IS OF ECO-EFFICIENCY ON ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE ADDITION. THE RAW MATERIAL TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION ARE ALL ENVIRONMENTAL USER FRIENDLY AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BALANCE OXYGEN LEVEL IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHILE FIXING NITROGEN IN THE SOIL

> Technical Feasibility

AFTER SEEING THE MANY CHALLENGES WHICH THE RURAL COMMUNINITY, WHO ARE MAINLY SMALL SCALE FARMERS GO THROUGH WHEN ACCESSING THE BASIC NEEDS OUT OF THEIR HARD WORK, FOR EXAMPLE AFTER HARVESTING SUNFLOWER OR MAIZE, BIG COMPANIES WILL BUY AND TAKE THE PRODUCE FOR PROCESSING OUT OF LOCALITY AND LATER IF POSSIBLE THAT FINISHED PRODUCT GOES BACK TO THE RURAL COMMUNITIES, THEY COME AT A VERY HIGH COST AND IN SHORT SUPPLY. SOMETIMES THEY NEVER COME BACK, HENCE LEAVING A VACUUM OF THE MUCH NEEDED NUTRITION PRODUCT IN THE COMMUNITY. ARISING FROM THIS AND LOOKING AT THE LIFE CYCLE OF A BUTTERFLY, WHERE AT EACH STAGE THERE IS LIFE AND FROM THAT I DESIGNED MY INNOVATION BEARING IN MIND THAT MOST RURAL PARTS OF ZAMBIA THE MAIN INDUSTRY IS THE AGRICULTURE SECTION AND  SOME OF THE  RAW MATERIALS IF WELL IMPLEMENTED WITHIN ITS LOCALITY CAN HELP TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY.
LET US CONSIDER THE FOUR STAGES OF A BUTTERFLY;
First Stage: EGG,  LET US IMAGIN THE BEGGINING OF RAIN SEASON AND SMALL SCALE FARMERS ARE EQUIPED WITH INPUTS SUPPORT PROGRAM (seed and fertilizer).
Second Stage: CATERPILLAR, LET US IMAGIN WITH FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS, GOOD MANAGEMENT AND GOOD OUTPUT, THE SMALL SCALE FARMERS WILL SUPPLY THE RAW MATERIAL (maize, groundnuts, sunflower/soybeans etc) TO LOCAL INNOVATION PROJECT FOR PROCESSING.
Third Stage: PUPA, LET US IMAGIN THE INNOVATION PROJECT (mini-milling plant), WITH WELL MANAGEMENT AND RIGHT EQUIPMENT PUT IN PLACE, THE SUPPLIED RAW MATERIAL WILL BE PROCESSED INTO FINISHED READY TO USE PRODUCTS WITHIN THE LOCALITY AND THE BY-PRODUCTS CAN BE SUPPLIED TO OTHER EXISTING BUSINESS FOR FURTHER PROCESSING
Fourth Stage: ADULT, BOOM! THIS WILL BE A MARKET AND SUPPLY CHAIN OF FINISHED PRODUCTS TO SUPPLEMENT THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITIES FOR GOOD HEALTH LIVING. THIS MAY ALSO REDUCE DISTANCES IN SEARCH OF THE BASIC COMMODITIES.
PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1. PROPOSED INVESTMENT FOR MINI-MILLING PLANT
a). PURCHASE OF HAMMER HILL AND CLEANING ACCESSORIES.......US$3,250
b). PURCHASE OF MAIZE DEHULLER AND CLEANING ACCESSORIES.............US$2,600
c). PURCHASE OF SUNFLOWER/SOYBEANS OIL EXPELLER MACHINE.............US$7,000
d). TRANSPORTATION OF EQUIPMENT AND BUILDING MATERIAL.........US$500
e). WHEN THE BUSINESS GROWS, CONTRUCTION OF STANDARD FISH POND
2. TIME SCALE
SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, ACTIVITIES WILL BE AS FOLLOWS;
a). BUSINESS NAME REGISTRATION.........................DONE 
b). SITE SELECTION AND AWARENESS .......................... DONE
c). PURCHASE OF HAMMER HILL ......................... APRIL, 2022
d). CONSTRUCTION OF EQUIPMENT STORAGE HOUSE.........NEARING COMPLETION 
e). PURCHASE OF MAIZE DEHULLER AND CLEANING ACCESSARIES........ APRIL, 2022
f). PURCHASE OF SUNFLOWER/SOYBEANS OIL EXPELLER MACHINE......APRIL, 2022
g). TRANSPORTATION OF MACHINERY AND BUILDING MATERIAL........... MAY, 2022
h). INSTALLATION OF MINI MILLING PLANT EQUIPMENT................... JUNE, 2022
i). TESTING PRODUCTION QUALITY AND OFFICIAL OPENING........... JULY, 2022

> Anticipated Social Impact

a) CREATES JOB OPPORTUNITIES
b) PROMOTES MORE WOMEN AND YOUTHS TO ENGAGE IN AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS BY GROWING MORE SUNFLOWER/SOYBEANS, GROUNDNUTS AND MAIZE AS THESE WILL BE OUR MAIN RAW MATERIAL FOR PRODUCTION
c) IT WILL ADD NUTRITION VALUE TO PEOPLE'S DIET AS COOKING OIL WILL BE WITHIN THIER REACH, HENCE PROMOTES GOOD HEALTH
d) SAVES TRANPORT COSTS IN SEARCH OF THE COMMODITY.
THE RELEVANCE OF THE PROPOSED INNOVATION TO THE CURRENT MARKET ARE THAT AS LONG AS THE EARTH EXISTS, THERE WILL BE ALWAYS THOSE WHO DEMAND GRAIN FLOUR AND SEEDS OIL FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND FEEDS FOR ANIMALS. IT ALSO PROMOTE UN SDG AND THE BY-PRODUCTS CAN ALSO BE USED FOR ORGANIC FARMING AND AQUACULTURE FISH FARMING, THEREFORE WE NEED TO MOVE IN QUICKLY AND INSTALL ALL THE NECESSARY MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT TO KEEP ABREAST OF COMPETITORS
