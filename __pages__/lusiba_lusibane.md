Lusiba Lusibane is a poetry inspired intervention. The platform is used to educate, empower and revive poetry in the art industry in the kingdom. This intervention also provides poetry learning sessions to different communities. 
Some poetry shows are hosted with the intent to raise money to support neighborhood care points and local organizations that support orphan and vulnerable children.
