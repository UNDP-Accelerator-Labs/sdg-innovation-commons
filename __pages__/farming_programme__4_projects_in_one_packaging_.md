FARMING PROGRAMME (4 projects in one packaging)

> Brief description of the innovation

Programme as it is combination of projects:  Land already available in kapiri mposhi about 100 hectares where l already made adam of water with a target:first project is on Crop faming target is tomato mass production throughout the year. Second Make fish pond for fish faming and supply fish to mulungushi university and boarding schools in central province:  Live stock faming target is Cattle, goat and sheep to supply to mulungushi university and boarding schools in central: third is chicken raring portly faming target is village both layers and boilers: Fourth is Orange and lemon fruits.

The combination of these projects will be complementing each other in regards to input resources, manure from cows, goats and chicken will used in tomatoe and fruit plants  production, chicken manure and tomatoe remains for fish food. Required cost of capital is Zmk3, 000, 000 to Zmk5,000,000 which the funding needed.
Expected returns of  k150,000  per month after 1 year of production.
