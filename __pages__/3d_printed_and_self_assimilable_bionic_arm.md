A bionic arm developed by teenagers that costs only 250$ for the parts that are needed and can be assembled by anyone in one hour. They do not charge for labor or shipping nor get profit from it. The concept is to allow people from developing countries, especially for children in growth to have the ability to afford this product because the cheapest traditional bionic arm costs about 7000$. The bionic arm also has the ability to adjust to the growth of the hand for children.
