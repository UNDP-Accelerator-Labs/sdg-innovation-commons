Café of Innovation and Ideas: Boosting Economic Diversification through Technology and Strategic Foresight 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that Libya's economy is heavily reliant on oil, accounting for approximately 95% of government revenues, which exposes the country to significant risks from market volatility. Additionally, the high unemployment rate, particularly among youth, underscores the urgent need for economic diversification and the creation of alternative opportunities. We face the challenge of fostering a collaborative environment that leverages technology and strategic foresight to drive innovation and economic diversification and growth, while also ensuring that diverse perspectives are included to reshape Libya's economic future. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The issue of oil dependence is longstanding, the current approach to addressing it through innovative strategies and collective intelligence represents a new innovative effort to redefine Libya's economic future.  

The urgency for economic diversification is no longer seen as a luxury but as a critical necessity for sustainable development and economic stability. 

Key stakeholders involved in addressing this challenge include government officials from various ministries, industry leaders, academics, technology entrepreneurs, and civil society representatives. These groups are essential for fostering dialogue and collaboration to identify innovative solutions for economic diversification. 

The current situation in Libya reflects a critical juncture where the need for economic transformation is recognized, but the path forward requires innovative approaches. The workshop organized by the UNDP Accelerator Lab aims to harness collective intelligence and foresight tools to envision a diversified economy. However, the existing reliance on oil continues to produce undesired effects, such as high unemployment, limited economic resilience, and a lack of investment in alternative sectors. This situation perpetuates social inequalities and stifles innovation, making it imperative to shift towards a more sustainable and diversified economic model.

The challenge is underscored by several official data sources that highlight the critical need for economic diversification in Libya: 

African Development Bank Report: The latest annual report (aeo_2024_-_country_notes.pdf) identifies Libya’s over-reliance on oil, contributing 97% of government revenues, as a significant vulnerability. It also notes high unemployment rates, particularly among youth, as a pressing issue requiring urgent policy intervention. 

World Bank Data: Key indicators from the World Bank reflect the disproportionate contribution of oil to GDP and the limited diversification across other sectors, demonstrating a lack of economic resilience to external shocks like fluctuating oil prices. 

UNDP Human Development Report (2023-2024): This report highlights Libya's development challenges, emphasizing the need for inclusive economic growth and investment in non-oil sectors to address inequalities and drive sustainable development. 

Youth Unemployment Statistics: Data from Libya’s Ministry of Labor and International Labor Organization (ILO) shows that youth unemployment exceeds 30%, a figure far above regional averages, underscoring the urgency of creating alternative livelihoods.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Innovative Foresight Methodologies: The Accelerator Lab specializes in applying foresight tools, such as the Three Horizons model, to strategic planning. This approach allows stakeholders to envision multiple future scenarios and develop long-term strategies that are adaptable to changing circumstances. By equipping participants with practical skills in foresight, we empower them to anticipate economic challenges and opportunities, fostering a proactive rather than reactive mindset. 

Prototyping Technique and Scalability Possibility 

The Accelerator Lab can utilize prototyping techniques to develop and test innovative solutions in real-world contexts. This approach allows stakeholders to create small-scale models of initiatives, such as pilot projects in renewable energy, e-commerce, or technology incubators. The iterative nature of prototyping enables stakeholders to gather feedback, refine their strategies, and evaluate the feasibility of scaling successful projects. 

Scalability is essential for achieving widespread impact. By collaborating with the Ministry of Economy and other governmental stakeholders, the Accelerator Lab can ensure that successful prototypes align with national policies. This co-creation fosters ownership and commitment from government entities, facilitating the integration of innovative solutions into broader economic strategies. 

Co-Creation with Governmental Stakeholders 

Engaging the Ministry of Economy and other governmental stakeholders in the co-creation process is vital for ensuring that proposed solutions are both innovative and practical within the existing regulatory framework. Involving these stakeholders from the beginning allows the Accelerator Lab to leverage their expertise and resources, enhancing the effectiveness of initiatives. 

This collaborative approach can lead to the development of sector-specific strategic frameworks that guide the implementation of successful prototypes across various industries. For instance, a pilot project in renewable energy could evolve into a national program that promotes investment and innovation, supported by appropriate policy incentives. 

Capacity Building for Sustainable Impact: Our focus on capacity building and knowledge transfer ensures that the skills and insights gained during the workshop extend beyond the immediate event. By producing accessible educational resources, such as tailored videos on the Three Horizons model, we facilitate broader awareness and scalability of foresight practices across Libya. This investment in human capital is crucial for fostering a culture of strategic planning and resilience in the long term.
