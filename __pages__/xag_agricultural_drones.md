> Description of the solution

This solution utilizes XAG agricultural drones (e.g., P100 Pro) and the XAG Wisdom Agricultural System in citrus orchards. Drones address terrain issues, save labor (up to 83.3% reduction), enhance spraying with features like high efficiency and adjustable atomization, and improve fruit quality. The system monitors environmental data, analyzes soil, controls irrigation, uses remote sensing for mapping and guiding drone operations, and enables convenient orchard management, ultimately enhancing efficiency, cutting costs, and promoting digitalization and industry transformation.
