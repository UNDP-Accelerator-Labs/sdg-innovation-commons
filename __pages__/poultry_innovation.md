> Title of the innovation

Poultry innovation

> Brief description of the innovation

Rearing of chicken,this technical guide promotes sustainable small sale poultry production we can give an example of the two districts in Western province Nkeyema and Namwala  people move from these districts mentioned to go to Lusaka and buy good scales which is about 800km from Nkeyema to Lusaka therefore people suffer a lot hence if we as a group implement the availability of poultry farming in that area will develop local consumers generally prefer to order the stocks from within the district rather than moving long distances. The existence of a local market offering good sales opportunities and adequate transport facilities will add up to there businesses because poultry enterprises will be a huge opportunity for the people within .Egg consumption will also continue to grow because eggs are inexpensive,mild tasting and are easy to process and include in other foods,effecient protein,egg farms have the daily data point of average egg production. Therefore it will improve agricultural production on a sustainable basis .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Chicken manure can make money for, there is a market for these products because everyone, young and old,rich and poor eats poultry products. Quick return on investment also eggs consumptions will produce proteins, developed the market structure,assist the people in planning and program implemention of the environment,hard working of the people also to enable the people achieve the ends set back by them in order to reach our goals because as an innovator you are a tool for more ubundant life. Nkeyema district.it depends on the type of human resources and level of the people It will depend on the economy standard and approach people will be making,it will also need participation effort that will be made as a group. The value additional is that it will improve food supply, opportunities for rural population,in terms of nutrition proteins will be available to the community, creating income and also promoting respect for social cultural values, people will have access to the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

It will be designed in an open house system because of the simplicity of it's construction will enable ease of heat management and minimal management cost . Any proposed implemention plan as got the following break downs the project you want to undertake, 1 the requirements of the project you want to undertake,2 the value of the project (economically), 3 availability of manpower,4 are we economically abled to handle the project that is in plan after, all these requirements thus implementation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will create income and employment for the people, improve food supply, people will develop knowledge and skills, maintain biodiversity also conserving environment resources. The proposed innovation will be more relevant because it consists of chicken layers and the current market does not have these sales on the market.
