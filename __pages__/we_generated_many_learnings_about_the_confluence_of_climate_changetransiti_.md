## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Many locations most vulnerable to flooding (e.g., fishing villages, paddy farms) are also rapidly aging due to out-migration. 


2. Family and traditional culture were especially important in determining priorities and solutions in the state of Sarawak. 

3. State boundaries have major impacts on the  geographical development of industries, due to state policies and capacity of state officials to support and regulate industrial development. 

4. Healthcare spending threatens to crowd out federal government fiscal space over the next 30 years.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

This work will continue into Q1 2024. We are socializing findings with the CO, and expect that it will inform new programming and priorities in the development of the new CPD. 
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We were carrying out synthesis of data across climate transition and Malaysia's demographic transition. These two areas are studied in isolation, where there is actually a high level of confluence. Our focus was on the areas of work, social protection, and retirement. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We wanted to explore whether existing Malaysian policies are fit-for-purpose in the face of two megatrends. Futures methods enabled long-term perspective, while systems thinking, micro-narratives, and visual thinking &amp; mapping were important tools for synthesis.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We have engaged close to 200 stakeholders in regional consultations across Malaysia and leveraged local foresight expertise. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
