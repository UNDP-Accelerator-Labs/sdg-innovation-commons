> Title of the innovation

Yaka shines power machine (MYSP)

> Brief description of the innovation

Yaka shines is a local man made initiative innovation made out of simple mechanism of electronics components. There are two types of machines small portable machine designed domestically  and industrial power plant station which can go upto 11kv 60Hz non fuel driven with the forces of torsion spring forces against magnetic fields and it is costless . The  small machine which similarly works like inventors  but it more advanced than inventors ,this can be controlled with mobile phones wirelessly 
It an automatic recycled energy power ,this is designed with the use of a 12v dc to 230v of output ,3300watts and 50Hz self renewable energy efficiency of 90%.
Works twenty-four service.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Yaka shines machine which will change the world through having pour energy because this machine is needs few components to be made.  This machine there have it's portions of work domestic power will supplying home and the how do farming and other related activities where there's no electricity especially people in rule Areas.no fuel is needed free energy our economic will stable.
YAKA MACHINE will create jobs to most everyone 99%will benefit through what this machine is going to offer like those engineers in farming ,hospitals ,trading marketer's,school and industries processors etc. No loadsheding people Will have standards livings and there will be more benefits to this country and people,quality energy make impossibilities becomes possible.

> Technical Feasibility

Yaka shines machines are unique machines initiative innovation was created under the influence of (loadsheding  and increase of future population) this machine needs technically explaination , this two machines the industrial and domestic ones they different according to there respectively works for the domestic is small used in homes and this is a portable machine use battery as a source of energy,it is a rechargeable machine producing power from 9/12 dc to ac up to 230v while the other is stationary planted high voltage power up 4kv to 9kv for run heavy loads.
This innovation needs support for it to be brought on market . innovation like industrial needs  help to be marketed to the entire world. yaka free energy machine stabilized the economy of this country cheaper and affordable.both costly classes and low class people you  are entitled to benefit it.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Yaka machine  will highly penetrate good market excss employment  This innovation will bring standard living therefore change both livings of  using costless powerful people from reliable of using toxic chemicals such as diesel engines,firewood,zeco loadings reduction and related activities .
Few years to come zeco will fail to supply both communities and industrial operations due to increase of activities and population growth in the world .
Yaka shines technology will help the world to have clean energy efficient for the people to use. This needs proper help ,ideas from anyone to improve on this machine all you are entitled freely .
Yaka improving world (MYSE)
