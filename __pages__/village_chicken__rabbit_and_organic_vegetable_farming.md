> Title of the innovation

Village Chicken, Rabbit and organic vegetable farming

> Brief description of the innovation

village Chicken, rabbit and organic vegetables, is an healthy cycle farming system that works hand in hand to produce nun GMO meat and organic vegetables, using chicken and rabbit waste, vegetables that are organic, containing rich nutrients such vitamin c, iron, magnesium and phosphorus are grown, with the nutrients the vegies contain, they help boost the bodys immunity when consumed.... part of the vegetables that are grown can be sold, others can be used to feed the animals (resulting in nun GMO meat ) with and improve housing rabbit urine collection can be implemented as the urine is a good manure that cane be used in production of veggies.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

expanding my innovation can, result in the ability to produce chicks, eggs, chicken meat, chicken manure, rabbit meat, rabbit urine (which is an organic fertilizer and insecticide ) and vegetables each month....and if these can be attained it can result in income generation as demand is high on the market for all. if this innovation is successful it will result in promoting healthy eating and help preserve the earth buy farming in a chemical free environment with no damage risk to the soil.

> Technical Feasibility

my innovation is designed to promote simples healthy and chemical free food production.

> Anticipated Social Impact

this innovation has the ability to reduce public health risks, as it promotes organic foods that do not usually contain toxic substances like  chemicals, preservatives and drugs. healthy living is as a result of eating healthy and eating nun GMO foods is a good start. the relevance of this innovation to the market includes, healthy living, prices and cost of production, for example currently GMO  chickens are being sold at the market price almost the same as nun GMO chickens when the cost of production for nun GMO chickens is cheaper,
