Homeless people and people living in informal settlements continue to be left behind in terms of receiving social benefits and services. Often, because they do not have a permanent shelter or live under difficult conditions. At present it is challenging for government to keep track of how many people to serve and adequately plan for benefits the underserved are entitled. Homeless People’s Mobile App is a tech solution which registers information of people in order to receive certain benefits. Beneficiaries are registered through a community health/extension worker and they are given a card encoded with a QR code and the card has a lanyard which they use to claim benefits. The QR code is a unique identifier of a beneficiary. Once the card is scanned, data such as geo-location, the person’s demographic information, health information and benefits received (e.g. Food package, soup kitchen credit, shelter and so on) is captured and stored in a central database. The solution is first going to be used to register an estimated 900 homeless people in Khomas region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khomas_Region) and then scaled up to be implemented in at least one other regions (Erongo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erongo_Region).
