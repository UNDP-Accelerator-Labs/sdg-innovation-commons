> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Do to the high number of unemployed Trained Teachers in the country,we hope to build community schools,3 to 4 per selected districts.These will generate income as learners will be expected to pay at least a k50/month multiplied by at least 5000 pupils by 3 months gives about k750 000 per term in some selected areas.We also hope to purchase about 500 sewing machines with the view to generate over k3m per month in some selected districts.Also not over looking campentry and bricklaying which can generate about k5m in some selected areas.These funds will be revolving so as to empower as many groups as possible.

> Technical Feasibility

The design of innovation is based on enhanced survival skills among the vulnerable people. To that effect, the innovation is composed a 10 member committee with variant skills capable of imparting survival skills in different disciplines. We aim to implement the plan in about 5 years time ignored to meet all the developmental goals as outlined in the plan. Other than committee members, we hope to recruit other staff members for outreach areas. These will include community Health workers,Teachers,Secretaries and other personnel.
