While passing through Boké, one of the towns of the lower coast of Guinea known for its basement and its geomine university, you will find on the national road 3 Complexe Hôtelier Filaoplus. A fairly well welcoming establishment with respect for the guests, the cost of the rooms varying between 35 and 70 Usd per night, the two reception rooms imensely dressed with good quality table covers and a smiling and very courteous staff willing to do everything implemented to satisfy customers. speaking of the rooms, you will necessarily find it to your liking. But what appeals is this quet of silence which is allowed even for the installed equipment. It looks like a deaf choir of its Mute, in the ocurence that of the chair placed at the small desk formed for your nocturnal typing and writing exercises. This chair has been completed in its elant by a kind of soft plastic slipper to break up the deafening noise that we make when we pull them up and most often the parents lecture us to lift the chair. Here, this is a great innovation, Zero noise, at least not to disturb the neighbor next door. do not hesitate to visit them while passing through Boké!
