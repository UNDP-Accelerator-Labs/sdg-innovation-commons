> Brief description of the innovation

The DAWN NET STRETCHER Initiative started in 2017 in our home when I began to research and experiment simple home remedies to keep mosquitos much away from us while we slept. The goal was to eventually develop an effective and easy way of reducing if not eliminating mosquito bites while resting in bed.
In 2019 the innovation was developed into a usable product and made known to PACRA for analysis, recognition and registration. In 2020, PACRA gave their recognition and patented it.
The DAWN NET STRETCHER is an initiative to be used wherever a mosquito net is in use, and for all bed and mattress sizes (Single, 3/4, Double, Queen and King). It can be provided to users in a variety of colours and shapes (Rectangular, Hexagon, Octagon, Circular and Oval)
A single stretcher is placed at the head side of the bed to lift up the mosquito net and another is placed at the foot side. A user can still use only one stretcher at the head side of the bed without one at the foot side and still enjoy the innovation’s usage benefits.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

•	Mosquito Net will be raised much away from the body lying in bed
This way it will help to keep mosquitos much away from the person in bed. 
•	Increases the interior space for the person within the net, hence promotes a sense of freedom for the user. The person in bed will lie or rest/sleep much more relaxed in the raised Mosquito Net.

•	Designed and manufactured to suit the size of Bed and Mattress. Therefore, it is suitable for every bedroom size.

•	Does not require extra space in the room than that occupied by the mattress, bed and mosquito net.

•	One stretcher or two can be used on the bed flexibly and removed easily. 

•	It is Portable. (Easy to carry and store)

•	It will outlive the mosquito net because it is NOT ATTACHED to it.

•	It is durable; therefore can be a permanent purchase for a client.

•	Can be provided in at least more than one colour, size and shape – for variety of choice.

•	There is no risk of injury to the person using it (it is not a health hazard).

•	The stretcher and materials used are not an environmental hazard.

•	There is no risk of damage to the bed, the wall and the roof/ceiling.

> Technical Feasibility

The overall vision and mission has been to try to ensure that all Malaria affected areas and people in the country access the product. It may be perceived as another contribution to Government efforts and those of the International Community in the fight against Malaria.
Targeted users are households, lodges, hotels and motels. It should aid in reducing the level or chances of mosquito bites while a person is resting in the bed.
