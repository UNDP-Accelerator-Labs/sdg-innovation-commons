> Title of the innovation

Enhancing Rural Livelihoods through Improved Food Security

> Brief description of the innovation

This project is designed to address the food shortage, so those poor families will be able to grow vegetables during spring, summer and autumn – and possibly in winter. AC4C Greenhouse will partner with a local agricultural cooperative formed by women members to develop an all-weather green-housing facility in the town of Mansa, Zambia. Due to mortality, alcoholism or other social problems, there are many women-headed households, taking care of large families. These women, both in rural and peri-urban areas, are seeking alternative livelihood activities and especially for small scale agriculture that allows self-consumption as well as cash income. Despite their herder’s background, most of them have some experience in gardening and are requesting training on agriculture, water and soil management as well as more efficient techniques (especially greenhouses).

Innovative approaches are developed to the constraints of the regions (short length growing period, poor quality of soil, water scarcity) and of the target groups (low capacity of investment, low agricultural knowledge). It specifically addresses climatic constraints in order to decrease the vulnerability of the people while building the capacity of the beneficiaries for improved, sustainable vegetable production.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The target population is the poor, vulnerable population of Luapula province and ethnic communities, women-headed households, households with disabled people, families with many children, newly settled families, vulnerable groups, ex-herders and resource-poor farmers will get priority in beneficiaries’ selection. Under the project 30 household families (approx. 150 people) will be the direct beneficiaries, while 20,000 will be indirect beneficiaries.

These 30 households will be formed into a community Group who will receive full support from the project in accessing required inputs – seed/seedlings, machinery, equipment, passive solar winter greenhouse, tunnels and storages - to cultivate potato and vegetables in 5 ha of irrigated lands with the application of a package of innovative and environmentally-friendly technologies. Beneficiary households will receive potato and vegetable seed and different technical and technological training.

> Technical Feasibility

The project was designed through a participatory process involving key stakeholders, who contributed to and expressed their agreement with the objectives, the proposed project components, and the overall implementation approach. The project will continue to involve key stakeholders in;
(i)	implementing combinations of approaches;
(ii)	generating, delivering, and testing passive solar greenhouse design; and
(iii)	assessing current practices, as well as the needs and priorities of disadvantaged communities and families. Activities stimulated by the project will require active participation by communities and beneficiaries. Stakeholders will also take part in project monitoring and evaluation. The local government will be closely involved throughout the project.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The benefits to the target population are:
	Locally owned, affordable, sustainable all-year-around operating winter greenhouse
	An extended period of vegetable cultivation will help the supply of own consumption of vegetables
	Supply of vegetables during the critical period with the help of bioclimatic root cellar operation
	Increase in nutrition status and nutrition knowledge
	Increase in children’s health and ability
	Income-generating through the sell of surplus vegetables at a lower cost so the whole community of Khankhongor town will benefit from the quality and low-price vegetable
	The winter greenhouse design will be disseminated so the better-off local residents can construct the greenhouse themselves and improve their food security situation
	Agricultural knowledge and skills improved
