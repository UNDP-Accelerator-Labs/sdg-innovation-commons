Libya has been in civil conflict since 2011 and many attempts were created to reconcile and unify the country through dialogues and workshops. We, the Accelerator Lab Libya, realized that civilians like joyful and color events that tend to bring together people from different political or ethnical backgrounds, and Libya has many skilled and creative artists who are located across the country. If we mobilize the artists from each war affected cities to create artistic work on valued location as a symbol of unification, it may fortify the current political attempt to unify and reconcile the country.
