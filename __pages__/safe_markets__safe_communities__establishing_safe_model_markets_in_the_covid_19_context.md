## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Nampaka Nkumbula

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

30/12/2020

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

COVID 19

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Markets have long served to increase food access in low-income areas and support small farmers and local businesses, as well as bolster a strong, locally empowering economy. Like supermarkets, farmers and food markets are deemed “essential businesses,” but concrete guidance on their safe operation during the COVID-19 crisis have not yet been standardized within and across cities in the country. Rather than closing the markets in Zambia, adaptation of the markets to public health contexts will yield food security, economic stability, youth and women’s empowerment.

 

To ensure business continuity for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) based in public areas such as markets, there will be a need to strengthen knowledge and individual and collective responsibilities towards adhering to public health regulations within markets. By leveraging Market Advisory Committees and local leadership in Lilanda, Chilenje and Nyumba Yanga, UNDP through the Accelerator lab in partnership with the Lusaka City Council and the Ministry of Health propose to pilot the model markets in Lusaka by rethinking and adapting existing market models to be compliant to COVID-19 safety guidelines, while ensuring that the intervention focuses on empowering women and youth; and thus increasing gender equality.

 


> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

 We want to learn what interventions can work to make markets safe trading area by exploring the impacts of targeted information campaign sessions on traders and community’s knowledge, attitudes and practices of COVD 19 public health regulations and whether introducing sanitization spots available at the entrance of markets make customers feel safe to trade in the markets are amongst traders and surrounding communities. 

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector
- Private Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Ministry of Health, Lusaka City Council, United Nations Volunteers
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

1.       What are the current knowledge levels, attitudes and practices that could lead to the continued spread of COVID-19?

2.       Will sanitization spots available at the entrance of markets make customers feel safe to trade in the markets?



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If Market traders design and implement their own rules, then market traders and customers will adhere to COVID 19 public health regulations

If Market safety officers use targeted messages on the importance of public health regulations in markets, then market traders and customers will adhere to COVID 19 public health regulations

If Community Based Volunteers and Community Youth Volunteers hold door to door sensitizations on the importance of COVID 19 public health regulations in communities surrounding markets, then there will be increased compliance among the public

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Pre-post test with comparison to control group (markets not receiving the interventions)

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of households when visiting markets

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed
