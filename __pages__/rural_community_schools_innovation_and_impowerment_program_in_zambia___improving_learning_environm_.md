> Brief description of the innovation

I lead a group of 15 Youths in Zambia under my program of Improving lives of school going children in rural areas in Zambia 

This is the program I started as an individual in 2019 and later brought on board few Youths who I move around with in rural areas where there are no schools and in some areas poor community school infrastructures, for us to render help to the vulnerable children and families using my own resources which I raise. 

In 2020 we helped over 200 families in southern Province Zambia and school going children in rural schools. We managed to meet few demands of children in terms of desk, books chalks and contributions in kind, towards the construction of new class blocks, because children were learning under trees.

Empowering and developing community schools in rural areas is what I have been trying to do with the Little resources I found. 

With my team, as Youths we wish to do even more than what we have been trying to do for the last two year. We have a Plan Drafted for us to go back to those rural schools and work with community Leaders to mordernize the schools but Resources is what has been a setback because we have been relying on small resources we generate Individualy. 

We have done a research through the visitations we have been making and we analysed the challenges children in rural areas go through and Identified areas which literally have no schools and areas with poor community schools where children learn under trees, they sit in the dust, poor infrastructure and so many challenges.

So if our program is funded we have the Drafted plan which is ready to be implemented for us to begin to improve these rural schools through Building modern infrastructure and take all necessary learning materials and facilities to these schools in cooperation with the Government so that education in rural Zambia can be easily accessible by children in villages.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation forcasteces on Improving lives of school going children in rural areas. There are community schools in rural areas and children do not learn in a Good environment, so by working with community Leaders we can improve the standards of the schools to the modern standards. 

At the moment we are targeting southern province of Zambia in typical rural areas where there are only community schools which are not less than 45 kilometers away from school going children e.g Munyumbwe area, Monze rural, and many other surrounding areas. And we also have a plan to roll this program all over Zambia if we see that we have enough support. 

This innovation will reduce illiteracy levels in rural Zambia because children will have equal access to quality education in rural areas just like in urban areas.

> Technical Feasibility

The program has been in existence for 2 years now and everything has been done through few resources generated as an Individual. 

So We identified areas like in Monze at Sinyendeende community school and surrounding districts, Munyumbwe area in Chibuwe, Namwala area and other surrounding areas where we intend to mordenise the basic community schools and others to improve them to a standard of secondary schools, others improve them t boarding schools standards,

Infrastructure is our main focus, they must be funded starting from foundation to the final level until the school is commissioned with closely monitoring of work development at the school.

If resources are readily available, within a period of 5 years there can be huge differences in the Region in terms of the standards of community schools in rural Zambia and lives of school going children can be improved.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will reduce levels of illiteracy in Zambia. Children at the moment in these areas their rights to proper leanings environment has been infringed, this innovation will address all these challenges. 

It will reduce ealy marriages and school school drop outs among girl children in rural areas.
