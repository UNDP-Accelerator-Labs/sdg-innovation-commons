## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Mongolia Action Learning Plan 2022
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to improve digital access and literacy among the vulnerable groups.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

During the 2021 learning cycle, AccLab completed a "Qualitative Assessment of Digital Access and Skills among Vulnerable groups", which revealed that: The digital divide is real: The availability of digital devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, and smartphones, and connection to secure and fast internet has become an important entry point for gaining digital skills. The study found that only 20% of the respondents have personal computers at home and, therefore, are likely to purchase a home internet connection. Nonetheless, 70% of the respondents are not connected to secure and fast internet.  Though the respondents acknowledged that computers and internet connection are essential tools for their children to continue studying at home during the pandemic, they simply cannot afford them. This income barrier was faced by low-income, rural, and migrant families, as well as people with disabilities. Home internet connection costs around MNT 25,000 (USD 8) monthly, but for many respondents, this cost is already too high. As a result, internet access is not a main priority for these households. People with disabilities and seniors indicated that receiving government and other commercial services through websites and applications is not as easy as it seems. For instance, people with hearing loss pointed out that audio and video content usually does not have captions or transcripts, and that they need sign language to explain important information because the text is difficult to read. Seniors indicated that websites and applications have too many steps to follow, which confuse and distract them, and user guidelines are also not easy to understand.  Capacity building in digital skills is needed: Overall, our assessment demonstrated that the respondents from all groups remain only basic users of information and communication technology. Although many responded that they feel comfortable using their smartphones, nearly all were unsure of their ability to work on computers and laptops. One significant find is that one’s digital skills improved the longer the respondent owned a digital device.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Based on the findings of the survey, our Lab would focus on the specific vulnerable groups to reach out with digital skills training. For instance, we could focus on elderly and people with disabilities to find solutions suitable for their specific needs.  Institutionally, we just have the new Ministry of Digital Development and Communication established. Though the Ministry is supposed to implement the Digital Nation strategy, which outlines Digital Literacy as one of its main goals, it would require time for the Ministry to streamline its activities and reach out to specific pockets of population. Therefore, our Lab needs to work on it, as we possess the most update information and data, dedicated time and efforts to learn and identify good practices in other countries, as well as establsihed some working level relationships with the CSOs working at the field, as well as the newly established Ministry. Our Lab is positioned well to respond to the digital skills needs of vulnerable populations compared with our clasters and units within the CO.  Given the acknowledgement in UNDP Strategic Plan that digitalization is an enabler to reach to development outcomes and SDGs in the long run, the digital skills development is the challenge worth exploring, as it would help to eliminate some sort of digital divide, as well as contribute to utilization and improved quality of life of the vulnerable groups.

## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

E-Mongolia Academy, Ministry of Digital Development and Communication, Ministry of Education, National Institute for Education Research, Mongolian Federation of Blind People, Mongolian Association of Deaf, Whyze Agency, Faro Foundation

> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Our main partner, E-Mongolia Academy is a government entity, which is overlooking the digitalization of government services. We are collaborating with them mainly on making public service accessibility for people with disabilities. The Ministry of Digital Development and Communication is the main policy making government agency in the field of digital skills, coordinated with Ministry of Education and National Institute for Education Research. In addition to them, we are mobilizing CSOs of people with disabilities to work closely with people in need for digital skills. We are also working with CSOs working on skills delivery such as Faro Foundation. Whyze agency is the private sector entity, which is engaged in online promotion and campaign.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Is it possible to make progress in digital skills of elderly and people with disabilities? We need to learn about best ways to reach out to the target groups, effective content, teaching methodology as well as strategies to take into account. Based on the learning of the experiments come up with policy suggestions to the Ministry of Digital Development and Communication.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral insights - depending on the behaviours and existing practice to come up with the best way to reach out to the target groups Co-Creation - we would develop various content with participation and active inputs of the vulnerable groups Human-centered Design - we would develop training programs with end-user in mind Micro Narratives - our stories and focus will be specific group focused. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Social media data will provide us with actual involvement and real time response to the content and training materials we are producing. In addition to this, we need specific tailored data from people with disabilities, which would require special assistance.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Our goal is to come up with policy recommendations on digital literacy, so that Ministry of Digital Development and Communication could integrate and act upon in their work.
