## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

We were able to identify and strengthen the key offerings of UNDP in the competitve space of social entrepreneurship. We built a space wherein we were able to learn effectively from Entrepreneur Support organisations (ESOs)- what has worked what has not worked in this space! 

We learnt from the shared experiences and therefore we created a space by convening a physical consultation in World Cafe style (with 5 thematic tables) to learn from what worked , what has not. We were complimented on creating a neutral learning space for all. Truly an example of collective intelligence. How can we be better together?

We are still working on this question in phase 2- How do we get a pooled funding mechanism for operationalising this hub?

Once done, all the ESOs who run incubation programs for scouting SDG solutions will benefit as a member of this hub. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We conducted a scoping study spanning 50 consultations with key entrepreneur support organisations who run incubation programs for social entrepreneurship in India. We are now working with 3 teams in CO to jointly raise resources for operationalising this hub

> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
We are in the process of publishing a vlog soon
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

For us deep listening, deep interviews, individual as well as focused group discussions were really helpful. In total, we have conducted over 30-40 interviews. And additionally, we had a face to face consultation with 25 key stakeholders each representing a different organisation.
