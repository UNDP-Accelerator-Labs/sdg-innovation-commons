> Description

Semilla Róga is an initiative of the Organization of Peasant and Indigenous Women CONAMURI that collects the experience of rescue, reproduction and defense that the peasant and indigenous communities do with respect to native and Creole seeds, considered heritage of the peoples at the service of The humanity. The conservation and multiplication of native and creole seeds strengthens the sovereignty and food security of a country, in addition to the cultural meaning and emphasis placed on self-consumption and the promotion of the right to food of rural communities.
