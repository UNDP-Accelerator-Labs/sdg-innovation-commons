> Type of the Solution

Infrastructure Development, Policy &amp; Planning

> Affected Sector

Transport

> Description of the solution

This solution encompasses a variety of strategies to enhance public transportation infrastructure and services. It can involve expanding networks (buses, trains, trams, etc.), increasing frequency and reliability, improving accessibility for people with disabilities, integrating different modes of transport, and implementing fare structures that encourage ridership. Ultimately, improved public transportation systems aim to provide a more attractive and convenient alternative to private vehicles.

> Socio-economic effects

Reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, reduced noise pollution, improved access to jobs and services, potential economic benefits through increased ridership and job creation

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- national government

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes
