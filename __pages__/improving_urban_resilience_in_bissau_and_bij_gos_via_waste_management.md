## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Enhancing Climate Resilience and Sustainable Urban Development in Bissau and Bijágos through Waste Management 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that in Bissau and Bijágos there is a lack of waste management, due to the untimely and unorganized manner in which waste is collected and managed. This is a widespread issue regardless of urban or suburban areas. Additionally, overpopulated neighbourhoods waste is piled up within close proximity of residents which often leads to concerns to public health and the proliferation of dangerous and infectious diseases. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Autonomous Sector of Bissau and Bijagos Archipelago faces increasing climate-related challenges, including flooding, drought, and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate. These challenges threaten the livelihoods and well-being of the urban and peri-urban population. By focusing on water resource management, this project addresses a critical need for improved access to clean water, as well as mitigating the effects of changing climate patterns. The integration of climate-smart waste management recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental and urban health concerns. This project's community-based and gender-sensitive approach empowers local residents, particularly women and youth, to participate actively in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. The Accelerator Labs will work with the Sustainable Planet and Health teams in order to apply innovative methodologies aimed at exploring and understanding the nature of the waste management in the city through key stakeholder engagement to identify sustainable solutions to empower Climate Resilience and Sustainable Urban Development.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The added value the Accelerator Lab is bringing is the ability to use innovative methodologies such as collective intelligence, design thinking, futures thinking and system mapping in order to identify where there is an issue and swiftly seek solutions that respond to the challenge at hand. The Lab working in this area does not make the work of other agencies or stakeholders redundant, but it does bring them together to avoid the working in silos which appears to be the case, whereby a large quantity of work is being done in an isolated manner, as opposed to collective. Additionally, the experimentation aspect of the Lab learning cycle allows for the testing of solutions before delivering a final product, which allows room for error and human centred design.
