Waste management is a major challenge in Bangladesh, particularly in the capital city Dhaka, with citizens often not adhering to sustainable practices and dumping waste indiscriminately. The startup GARBAGEMAN, with its vision to make Bangladesh greener and cleaner, has introduced a modern and scientific approach towards efficient waste management through recycling organic and inorganic waste into reusable products . Their activities include: 1. Regen vermicompost - turning food waste into high quality organic fertilizer 2. Zero waste consulting - support organizations to reduce waste to have a positive impact on the environment 3. Recycling platform - connecting concerned citizens to the recycling process via its ‘Door to Door’ waste collection service, which makes it easy for everyone to manage their waste on a fast moving life. This is a ‘Trash to Cash’ service that provides scheduled waste collection from households and corporations on a recycling platform. The goal is to stop the waste from getting dumped at landfills and turn them into recycled resources.
