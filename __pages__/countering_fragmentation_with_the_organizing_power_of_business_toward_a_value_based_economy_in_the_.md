## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Apart of our exploration work of models to be adopted by MSMEs to evolve a value-based Palestinian economy we found out that:  1) Without strong institutions to promote cooperation, resource, sharing and knowledge transfer, Palestinian businesses will remain fragmented and isolated. There is need to socialize the concept and value of aggregation among businesses. There have been scattered initiative to support business aggregation, but efforts should be better harmonized and institutionalized both at the local and national level through MSMEs support mechanisms 2) Palestinian businesses are highly dependent on the Israeli market- almost 90% of their sales goes to Israel. They also work as sub-contractors to Israeli companies exporting Palestinian product under Israeli brands and with a small margin of profit 3) Aggressive competition on price in the present hostile business climate does not deliver success. It actually exacerbates the mutual challenges of Palestinian businesses. If businesses allow for cooperation among themselves, they can organize their own proxies of institutional capital. It is very difficult for businesses that market sustainable products to connect with small producers. We need a medium that can group small producers and develop their products and stories, providing them with fair wages and working environment. This relieves the pressure on producers having to market and package their products, and helps them focus on production and enhancing their offer. 4) Palestinians businesses must leverage the uniqueness of their rich cultural heritage and sustainable practices to build a value-based offering for which there is a growing demand in the global markets 5) Aggregation of small and informal businesses is happening across various sectors through clusters of self-organizing businesses interested in clustering for value but these clusters including furniture, handicraft, food processing and leather industry but they lack the know-how and expertise to institutionalize the pathway and mechanism for business transformation towards value-based economy. 6) For many Palestinian business collectives the primary challenge to stability and growth is a labor shortage. This is because employees can easily be attracted to higher paying jobs in Israel and/or settlements (up to 3 times higher) meaning that talent is frequently leaving. Addressing the labor force issue is key to strengthen aggregation models and support businesses to meet market demand increased as a result of adopting value-based business models.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Inclusive and resilient economic development is a broad policy area prioritized by the CO. We had to map out challenges and build on previous groundwork and programmatic priorities  to land on the inclusivity aspect of economic growth for MSMEs. Coming up with more concrete focus areas for our interventions was a difficult task. From that point, we started zooming in on micro and small businesses, trying to understand their pain points and crafting ways to aggregate efforts, streamline sustainable production, and work on the soft aspects of productivity such as branding and marketing.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Through community immersion, we had a series of field visits, interviews and focus group discussions to capture insights and perspectives of unusual suspects to feed into system mapping of MSMEs pain points. This type of data is not available in national statistics and reports as the AccLab community immersion focused mainly on the informal sector constituting almost 50% of the economy in Palestine and considered a grey area with limited data to inform actions. For example, the national statistics show that Palestine has a high unemployment rate (23%; 69% among women and 39% among youth) but most MSMEs report serious shortage in workers and leakage of labor to Israeli settlements, which affects MSMEs productivity and potential for expansion. The national statistics reflect unemployment rate among educated people who usually look for jobs in the public sector or with big corporates and would shy away from applying to job opportunities or refrain from vocational jobs at MSMEs, where the latter is the backbone and key for the resilience of the Palestinian economy.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

System thinking was crucial to understand the root causes of the system failure pertaining to MSME development mechanisms. It helped us identify the strategic enablers, avoid the single solution approach and guided the design of a portfolio of cornerstone and complementary interventions leading to a systemic change for the benefit of the MSME sector. System thinking also triggered a new ways of thinking around the vision for the Palestinian economy instead of the rigid and limited thinking adopted for the design of traditional programmes focusing on capacity building interventions instead of looking at institutionalized national and sub-national resilience mechanism 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Federation of chambers of commerce, Industry and Agriculture was our source of preliminary information on aggregation models adopted by businesses including informal clusters and facilitated  access to business groups through their network of chambers of commerce. The federation is striving to promote and strengthen cluster approach and had previous attempts to organize non-profit clusters across various sectors but few of them were sustained. They appreciated our support in understanding the root causes of success and failure of these clusters and build on the learning to inform the design of new initiatives aiming at leveraging the common interest of businesses and strengthening aggregation models. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Hebron Leather and Shoe Cluster, Cannan Fair Trade (agrobusiness), Bethlehem Fair Trade Artisans (Handicrafts), and Salfit Furniture Cluster.  Explored their business aggregation models to understand keys to success, gaps and challenges hindering these clusters from realizing their potential. We also brought together a multi-disciplinary team including local and international experts in private sector development, branding and marketing to assess the potential of these aggregation models to adopt more robust and institutionalized mechanisms to expand in the local markets and break into international markets.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Palestinian Monetary Authority- supported them in designing the first national MSME virtual helpdesk aiming to enhance communication and outreach to Palestinian MSMEs including informal business. The interactive platform (www.monshati.ps) provides information to businesses and wide range of services including access to finance apart of their US $300 million Estidama (sustainability) fund of concessional loans and zero interest loans to micro businesses. The platform is also linked to the physical local helpdesks established at the chambers of commerce apart of the MSME National Helpdesk Scheme launched by the Prime Minister's Office with UNDP support apart of the socio-economic response and recovery plans to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on Palestinian MSMEs. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Palestinian Monetary Authority: PMA is leading the largest stimulus fund to MSMEs apart of the government response and recovery plans from COVID-19 crisis. UNDP interest is not only in sensitizing this fund to be inclusive and responsive to the most marginalized groups including women and youth-led businesses, but also de-risking government investment in economic recovery by ensuring that target MSMEs have the required capacities and skills to manage these fund and effectively adapt to the new normal.
Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture: is the umbrella organization for all chambers of commerce with a membership base of 70,000 businesses. The federation chair the Private Sector Coordination Council comprised of 10 private sector organization which provides UNDP the access to data and valuable insights on the performance and needs of the private sector in Palestine- particularly MSMEs.
