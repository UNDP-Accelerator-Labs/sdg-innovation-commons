## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Con Vos Network, the pilot that connects community markets with digital inclusion 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to overcome gaps in the use of digital tools by getting people to go online with their daily errands, payments, and different tasks to foster digital inclusion.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The tools are out there. However, their mere existence does not foster innovation. Digital environments increasingly allow accessing products and services, many of them crucial for people’s subsistence, such as several public aids. However, people do not use them. Presently, the challenge is the adoption of technological advances and innovations. This project (https://www.undp.org/es/argentina/proyectos/little-help-my-neighbors) scales a grassroots innovation that connects community markets with digital inclusion. Con Vos is a network of local community stores, where neighbors can carry out digital transactions and operations close to their homes. This Network is designed to enable neighbors to do more things online and run their errands, saving time, money, and distance. We implemented one experience scaling this solution by creating a network of stores in partnership with local and federal governments. This Network was successfully implemented in 2021 in the city of Concepción del Uruguay, in the province of Entre Ríos, Argentina, featured as a bottom up urban innovation, https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2021-11/UNDP-Handbook-on-Smart-Urban-Innovations-V2.pdf and today it was launched with the municipal government of Fray Mamerto Esquiú, province of Catamarca, Argentina, with the support of the Argentine Undersecretariat of Administrative Innovation of the Chief of the National Cabinet of Ministers. The Con Vos Network is inspired by a neighborhood-level initiative, which can take different forms and potentially achieve higher levels of digital inclusion. These solutions were mapped by the Co_Lab of UNDP in Argentina, first in 2019, and then during the pandemic, in 2020. Today, being able to do things online is a key element to achieving higher levels of inclusion. However, in low-income neighborhoods, many people lack access to computers or cell phones; even if they do, they do not dare to complete their online tasks and errands by themselves. As a result, they must complete them at the offices located in the city. This results in more crowded offices and longer waiting times for customers. In addition to the waiting time, neighbors either walk a great distance or spend money to get to the offices by other means. Not to mention that work commitments may limit their availability, others may experience physical limitations that prevent them from moving around, or, in other situations, they may have care responsibilities of children or other dependents that are difficult or expensive to entrust to carry out their errands in person at public or private offices.

Digital inclusion is related to the skills required to use digital devices, to Internet connectivity and to the possibility of having access according to the needs of each user, particularly dependent people. Thanks to digital inclusion, there is infrastructure and knowledge to access digital environments for productive, educational, and recreational purposes, among others. In addition, according to the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (2020), the development of digital financial inclusion increases the resources of the financial system and productive activities. Globally, we can observe that there is a large digital divide among the people that have access to the Internet in developed countries compared to developing countries. However, within Latin America, there are also disparities among countries. According to a report from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC, by its Spanish acronym) (2022), in Q3 2022, Argentina registered a growth of 1.5% in fixed Internet access and 8.9% in mobile Internet. Although these data are positive, there are still differences between the countries of the continent. For example, Chile and Uruguay have a connectivity of 88.3% and 86.1%, respectively, while Argentina has 85.5% (World Bank, 2020). Within Argentina there are also large territorial gaps. According to the latest edition of the CABASE (Argentine Internet Chamber) Internet Index (2021), the City of Buenos Aires is the city with the highest level of fixed Internet access, in contrast to the province of Formosa, which shows the lowest rates of Internet access in the entire Argentine Republic. If we measure Internet access per 100 inhabitants, some of the Argentine provinces with the lowest Internet reach are Jujuy (53%), La Rioja (50%), Catamarca (49%), Chaco (43%), Corrientes (42%) and Formosa (32%). It can also be observed that there is a difference between the level of development among regions. The regions of Cuyo and Patagonia registered the highest level of percentage growth of the total inter-annual accesses, 14.17% and 13.52%, respectively. These values are considerably lower when we analyze the northern regions of Argentina, revealing a great regional disparity in terms of technological penetration in the area (CABASE Internet Index, 2021). Furthermore, the situation is uneven when we compare the distribution of connected devices within Argentina. In Patagonia, 72% of households have access to computers, while in the Northeast and Northwest regions, access reaches 55.1% and 54.6%, respectively. Regarding the population that uses mobiles phones, while Patagonia has 92% of the population using cell phones, the use of mobiles phones is 85.8% in the Northwest and 89% in the Northeast (INDEC, 2021). As we can see, the difference between Internet connectivity within the country is very uneven, both among provinces and regions. In addition, there is also a difference regarding payments made by digital means. According to INDEC (2021), in the Patagonia, online payments are used the most, reaching about 12%. These figures are different when talking about the Northeast and Northwest of the country: according to the report, online payments are between 8.4% and 8.1% of all transfers made in these provinces. In fact, at the country level, only 11.1% of the total payments made come from means other than cards or cash (CABASE Internet Index, 2021). Therefore, today, narrowing the digital divide and providing connectivity to all citizens are among the main challenges of the Argentine Republic. Although the National Government has actively participated in policies to improve this situation, there are still large differences among the sectors of the population within Argentina (Mi Argentina, 2022).

There are several signals that highlight the relevance of the action in relation to local contexts and the need to foster the adoption of digital tools: - Strengthen local capabilities. Going local with the SDGs is a pending issue for the UNDP, and this action is an example of a strategy fostering digital inclusion and community markets at once. - Promoting bottom-up innovation. The value of this initiative to foster digital inclusion has been featured as a bottom up example of smart urban innovation in the Handbook of Urban Innovation of the Singapore Digital Center of the UNDP https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2021-11/UNDP-Handbook-on-Smart-Urban-Innovations-V2.pdf. - The emergence of local contexts in daily life and the solution of daily needs. There is a global trend that values the life in the surroundings reflected in the idea of 15-minute cities https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/15-minute-city-stickiness/. This trend has been boosted by the pandemic. - Limits in the use of digital environments. Digital tools can be a solution, but many times do not meet the needs of users who are reluctant to use them, or certain groups find more difficult to use them, such as older people https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/05/17/barriers-to-adoption-and-attitudes-towards-technology/. In all, as stated by the ECLAC (2022) “the development and adoption of digital solutions are strongly influenced by structural factors. In countries where production structures are excessively heterogeneous and undiversified in product terms and where there are highly informal and insecure labour markets and socioeconomic constraints on access and connectivity, a large part of society is unable to appropriate the value generated by digital technologies” https://www.cepal.org/sites/default/files/publication/files/46817/S2000960_en.pdf.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This challenge is totally aligned with the Lab’s approach. Thinking at a system level, this solution can be a game changer by enhancing digital inclusion in an almost non-perceptible way for users. Known places allow people to get to new (previously unknown) places. People do not feel they are doing anything different, they feel in a safe space doing something new, for instance, a digital payment, with someone they already know. This is a very simple but powerful solution that harnesses a very basic infrastructure to access a more complex one. The value added by the Lab’s approach is potentiated by the partnerships with the RBLAC who funded the pilot, the CO, and the governments who implemented the project.


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The #RedConVos is a pilot test connecting community markets with digital inclusion. Local stores support their community members so that more individuals can do their transactions online, saving time and money by avoiding a trip to a capital city.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Why people do not use digital tools? How can we grant this access in an easy way? Which are the consequences of the lack of access in terms of effort, time and money spent to run these errands and do these tasks in persons? How can we take advantage of the things they already do, such as going to nearby stores, to grant this access? 


> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Our learning questions are: Smart cities improve the quality of life for their inhabitants by integrating technologies into their daily lives. In fact, as previously mentioned, this solution featured a bottom-up approach to smart cities innovations, https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2021-11/UNDP-Handbook-on-Smart-Urban-Innovations-V2.pdf. This pilot is a test as well as a second experience of scaling this solution that grants people easy access to a digital environment near their homes, saving time and money. The pilot test was co-created along with the municipality where it was implemented. We met on a regular basis to establish the goals of the initiative and the different tasks that needed to be undertaken to achieve them. Crowdsourcing will be used to collect data on the people who approach the stores to run online errands. The store owners provided this information, and we used a cash for data scheme in reward for their effort. This information will allow us to estimate the reasons why neighbors approach the stores: whether it was related with the lack of access to the proper devices and/or knowledge to run errands by themselves. Moreover, the forms filled by the store owners or employees will provide us with valuable information on the time, distance, and money they saved going to the stores that belong to the Con Vos Network, along with information about other demographic variables.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

All the information gathered along several steps of the project will allow us to document the action to answer the learning questions stated above. We will collect information on the motivations of the store owners to be part of the Network and on the impact of the action on their sales. Also, for each errand, they will be required to fill in a form. We will implement an innovative approach of cash for data to reward the store owners for the information they will handover to us by filling in the forms. This will allow us to gather information on the reasons for using this service and the time and money the users saved by doing this task online near their houses, instead of going to the city in person. All this data will let us to estimate the impact of the pilot on digital inclusion, decentralization of procedures and time and money saved by users. The lack of systematized knowledge on grassroots solutions for digital inclusion stresses the relevance of this initiative. https://www.ar.undp.org/content/argentina/es/home/library/hiv_aids/RedConVos22resumen.html

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This topic is a top priority for the UNDP. The pilot project is funded by the Trac 2 Call for proposals 2022: “Maximizing the strategic plan enablers in Latin America and the Caribbean: digitalization and innovation” of the RBLAC. This can be implemented in different schemes, some of them with very low costs, and its power is facilitating the adoption of digital tools with proven results. It is about digital inclusion, potentially, digital literacy. As a result, it is very easy to adopt by local governments as the two experiences of growth already showed (one in 2021 and the present one). Plus, it called the attention of the Undersecretariat of the Administrative Innovation of the Chief of the National Cabinet of Ministers which took ownership of the solution. It is about saving money and time by going digital with mandatory tasks and errands that originally were made in person in places either far or poorly connected, or both. It is about gender parity since care responsibilities prevent people to access different services that are now online and would be feasible for them. It is about digital inclusion because more people will go online with different things, and it is also about fostering nearby markets. Store owners will learn several procedures to help their neighbors, they will hire Internet access services, and in other cases, store owners will even buy a computer or a printer to offer these services. Beyond digital inclusion, digital literacy, and the development of community markets in the age of 15-minute cities are at stake. This solution is a micro adjustment to the general system. It triggers a big change that can solve the wider problem of digitalization, its consequences, and the gaps of the lack thereof. Plus, it helps build new relationships with the territory, the locals, the nearby city and the virtualization of many aspects of people’s lives.
