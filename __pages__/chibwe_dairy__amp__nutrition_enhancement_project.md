> Title of the innovation

CHIBWE DAIRY &amp; NUTRITION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT

> Brief description of the innovation

LVSCC would like to promote and develop a community-based livestock herd health service among 11 smallholder dairy farmers (SDF) groups in Chibwe, Kapirimposhi district in Central Province. In 2019, Chibwe had a population of 11,908 people of which 51% were women, 59% youths, and 18 % under 5-years. To improve community nutrition, dairy farming was started by a women group to which other members of the livestock community joined to make a total of 220 SDF. Heifer International Zambia donating 194 heads of dairy cattle in 2019 but now milk production is ailing or nonexistent. 

The SDFs have experienced poor livestock productivity and low milk production due to livestock diseases and deaths of their dairy cattle, limited dairy knowledge and skills, poor water supply and livestock nutrition and, inadequate veterinary service, and weak market linkages. 

LVSCC would like to enhance Chibwe SDFs’ productivity by improving access to livestock diseases diagnosis and treatment; developing herd health activities; enhancing fodder/pastures production; building capacities by providing e-extension and training to improve dairy practices and skills, establishing group livestock service centers, veterinary drugs sale agency, milk bulking sales outlet; encouraging value addition and strengthen linkages to milk value chains markets.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

At least 11 SLFGs LVSCC targeted. The SLFGs will earn money by the sale of milk to Parmalat Zambia or a local Milk Collection Centre in the Mpima Dairy Scheme or a planned local milk outlet. 

Income will be generated from the provision of clinical services, sale of veterinary drugs, and dairy requisites. On average a farmer group (FG) has 25 group members. Each FG has on average 200 heads of cattle. Herd health fees are estimated at US$ 30 per cow per annum. 

The challenge prize will help meet startup costs for a stock of veterinary drugs and capacity building of the SLFG, establish 11 livestock watering points, 11 woodlots of eucalyptus and bamboos, 20 hectares of pasture and fodder, develop a veterinary drugs sales agency, establish 11 milk bulking centers and 1 milk value addition and sales outlet. 

Production of pasture, cutting of LSC construction materials from woodlots, training of SLFG in use of personal protection ware, agro-vet drugs/chemicals handling, disposal of used containers and expired chemicals/drugs will minimize negative effects on the environment. The use of manure to improve soil structure and fertility in bio-digesters for biogas will be promoted. Additional watering points will decongest areas experiencing overgrazing and soil erosion.

> Technical Feasibility

Since 2008, LVSCC’s core activity has been the provision of Livestock Herd Health followed by the provision of capacity building of smallholder livestock farmers (SLF), mainly beef cattle as a prototype of this proposal. Vulnerable, but viable smallholder livestock farmers (SLF) in needy livestock communities are targeted. The SLF is identified, sensitized, mobilized, and organized into viable Smallholder Livestock Farmer Group (SLFG). 

The SLFGs are encouraged to establish livestock service centers (LSC). At LSC herd health extension services and training of SLFs are carried out. Training provides knowledge and skills in; livestock disease control and prevention, good group governance, veterinary and husbandry practices, entrepreneurship skills, and, environment protection practices. Clinical services such as dipping, deworming, vaccinations, vitamin supplementation, and treatment of livestock diseases are provided. Furthermore, LVSCC screens dairy cattle against Tuberculosis and Brucellosis and, vaccinate livestock against other diseases such as Anthrax and Blackleg. Extension practices include pasture/fodder production and livestock nutrition improvement, value addition, markets, and livestock value chains identification.

Implementation of the herd health program requires a 2-3 years plan per SLFG. Thereafter, the activities become self-sustaining. However, startup resources for capacity building need the support of the government or indeed its partners to alleviate operational resources limitations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

LVSCC and Value for Women UK, are currently conducting a SLF needs analysis survey to obtain insights into the differing needs and contexts of men, women and youth farmers in its operational area. This is aimed at helping LVSCC develop gender inclusion, marketing and sales strategies to promote increased participation of women and youth in the project. 

Preliminary findings indicate the need to enhance livestock production and diseases control by rolling out e-livestock extension networks and installation of additional LSC herd health facilities. The needs to encourage community mindset change, SLFG cohesion, creation of SLF-LSC for livestock producers, livestock value addition entrepreneur, youth AgroVet Sales Agents, youth marketing networks, youth spray race management working subgroups and, woodlots and pasture seed banks women subgroups in addition to CLW have been highlighted.

Direct benefits will include increased reporting of disease outbreaks as dip tanks/spray races will operate, reduced incidences of livestock diseases outbreaks, improved livestock health and reduced costs for treatment of livestock diseases, savings taking for disease prevention and control and, strengthened livestock infrastructure capacity and improved extension network among the livestock communities. Reduced use of antibiotics and antimicrobials, increased number of livestock, improved quality of livestock, improved livestock community’s cohesion, enhanced livestock market dynamics and overall food security among livestock-based communities are envisaged indirect benefits.

Among strategies is to diversify and increase participation of women and youth in household herd health activities. Successfully applying a gender lens to the herd health activities and the company’s market and sales strategies is expected to increase the efficiency of household livestock enterprises.

Annual household income of SLF will be increased through improved sale and off-take of quality livestock and livestock products mainly milk. Livestock and livestock products will include cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and poultry especially village chickens and rabbits; and, meat, milk, hides and manure, respectively. 

Improved animal health will lead to more livestock conceptions, increasing calving rate and reduce calf mortality. Savings from reduced purchases of medicines and payments to treat diseases due to decrease in incidence of livestock diseases will accrue to households. Improved livestock numbers will lead to increased draught power for household use, more livestock sales, increased transport hire, tillage of larger crop fields; more manure for biogas, sale and used to
improve field soil fertility and structure subsequently enhancing production of crops that they will sell for money.  

Employment will be created by those to participate in veterinary drugs sale agency and formation of milk bulking sales outlets. Youth market subgroups at LSC will assist SLF aggregate grain and livestock intended for sale and attract better buyers to purchase good volumes of grain and livestock as opposed to now when farm walk-in briefcase buyers dominate farm produce marketing, offer poor prices and buy limited stocks.
