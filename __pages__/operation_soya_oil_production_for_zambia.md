> Brief description of the innovation

Maheta foundation is a hybrid Non governmental organisation or foundation which was established to expose local small scale and large scale farmers to the value chains that exist in the industry and to the concept of producing raw materials on a large scale for value addition and export. We are working around having a Soya  oil processing plant and a workshop or training unit where we shall be handling trainings and online exposures to our farmers and innovators.
Agricultural technologies have already advanced but 70% of Zambians are still using traditional ways of farming which are so tidious. Maheta foundation is targeting to set up this value addition training units in North western Zambia - Kalumbila district. We are targeting rural Zambia because of the availability of small scale farmers who can readily supply us with the raw material (Soya) and to bring about industrialisation in those areas as we train many to become not only successful farmers but also value addition pioneers in many aspects.
It is one thing to train a farmer this concept but the most importantly aspect is real time exposure on the plant. To show them how it works, how to process and refine  as well as how to bottle it for sale and export. With the current deficit of oil in Zambia standing at 180000 metric tonnes annually the operation will produce many local farmers as millionaires.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Cooking oil production is one of the most lucrative businesses in Zambia standing due to the high demand of the product both in Zambia and all its neighbouring countries as well. Extruding-expelling process is profitable when the capacity is scaled up to 12.81 million kg of annual soybean oil production. The profitability is undeniable as a litre of cooking oil currently stands at k60.
Our current target market is the 20 million Zambian consumers and households of Zambia because our oil is going to be quality but very affordable for all Zambians while breaking the monopoly by other giants. We will produce local farmers who can compete fairly with the existing businesses to normalize pricing. We target to produce 20 successful oil plant business men each year by empowering them with knowledge and at times finances to boost production in the region.
By exposing and educating farmers practically on various crops and animals we believe this idea will raise awareness to the farmers on where to sell there produce and how to rise to the stage of processing their produce.

> Technical Feasibility

There are three stages to the implementing. 
Construction of plant and workshop
Validation
Manufacturing
Exposures and sales.
Once we access financing, we will use the 20 hectares of land we own to set up a 230000 USD plant and a workshop in Kalumbila which will take about four months to achieve and then after we shall involve the Chinese manufacturer to expose our production unit to the machine after installing it.

In the fifth month we believe we will be ready to start scrutinizing farmers that we can start putting on a program of exposure and training.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Many local farmers will realise the value of value addition and in turn become producers of oil.
Many youths and women will have jobs up to 1000 in the first year.
Many farmers of SOYA will have a readily available market for their produce.
The price of cooking oil will go down on the market because we will produce many producers.
This exercise will contribute to the efforts of poverty reduction and boost the economy of Zambia as more foreign currency will come in through international exports.
