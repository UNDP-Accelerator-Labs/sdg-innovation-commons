## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Tackeling youth unemployment
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

our challenge is that youth unmployment is considerable despite the number of annual graduates and the dynamic of the job market.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenge is ou third frontier challenge. During a field trip in Beja region, we noticed that the local economy is run by elder. There is definetly a lack of motivation from youth to get in the job market despite the different opportunities offered. We identified a social trend too which is graduates migration to work abroad, mainly engineers and doctors. According to some studies, salaries are the main driver to unemployment followed by work conditions and the nature of the job itself. We are then facing a higher number in annual graduates and a higher number of unemployed and "brain drain".

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We'd like to design an experiment for unemployed youth by supporting them within partners from the private sector to learn new tech skills. Tech companies and startups are very attractive for youth as much as being an entrepreneur and launching their own startups.  UNDP is working on entrepreneurship but in a particular region in Tunisia and the team is focusing on women entrepreneur and financial inclusion.
