## What is the challenge?

Plastic pollution is among the leading environmental challenges of Bangladesh. It leads to urban flooding, soil degradation, and air pollution. Efforts by government and private organizations have not significantly reduced the use of plastic bags. Alternatives like jute or cloth-based bags have not gained enough popularity to replace plastic bags, which remain dominant due to their affordability, durability, and versatility.
## What is the solution?

ECOWAVE is an eco-conscious company that collects and recycles discarded plastic bags into new, sustainable plastic trash bags. This initiative is part of their broader goal to minimize plastic waste and support environmental sustainability.

The company's process includes gathering used plastic bags from various sources and transforming them into new materials. These materials are then used to produce eco-friendly plastic bags. By utilizing this closed-loop system, ECOWAVE aims to limit the creation of new plastic bags, thereby maintaining a steady level of plastic production without additional environmental impact.

ECOWAVE's products, made from recycled materials, are designed to cater to different sectors, including restaurants, offices, hospitals, and factories. These bags are crafted for durability and sustainability, particularly for use in trash bins. This focus on creating purpose-built plastic bags demonstrates ECOWAVE's commitment to fostering a greener and more sustainable future.
