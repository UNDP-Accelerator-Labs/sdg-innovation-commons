## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can private sector networks be a possible solution for integrating supply chains and food supply disaster? Can home delivered food packs be a sound way of delivering value to low-income groups post disaster? Can private sector entities fill the gaps of food supply chains disrupted by COVID-19?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we repurpose existing logistics / supply chain during times of disaster, then we can ensure food security for communities 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Identify private sector partner willing to take part of experiment and enlist procurement for experiment implementation 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Accessibility and affordability of home delivered food

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

surveys

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

50% of ethnography, solutions mapping and experimenting role.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

partially proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Considering this was a pilot done in Vanuatu (which we could not visit due to COVID-19), this methodology was suited

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

4000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

NA

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

NA

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Vanuatu's local context was hard to understand from a distance but having a reliable local vendor was very useful.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

UNDP Procurement Process; media/optic malfunction

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Inclusive Growth Team

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Entrepreneurs in Vanuatu with similar  business lines. Those entrepreneurs who want to re-purpose their supply chains could benefit from the learning produced by this experiment.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

NA

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

SDG 8- Decent work and economic growth

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This activity was low on sense and explore as we could not physically travel to Vanuatu

> What surprised you?

Doing expeirments from a distance was challenging but could be finally done.
