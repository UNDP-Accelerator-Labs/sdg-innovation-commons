> Brief description of the innovation

The Innovation involves a Mobile and Web Bus Ticket Booking application with Seat Reservation. In short, a client will be able to check the buses available in a certain route online, check seats available or not reserved, reserve or select a seat online, make a payment online and receive an e-ticket via email which contains a QR Code which can be scanned during check-in time at the bus station. This will also be able to reduce the physical presence or interaction of people thus reducing the further spread of Covid-19.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income through charging commission on each ticket bought using the platform or application. The innovation will assist in challenges to do with bus booking which involves physically going to the bus station even on a rainy day to get a bus ticket and it will make people save time and money. The bus operators will use automated system and there will be no need of printing out stationery which pollutes the environment as everything will be done electronically. Our targeted market are Inter-City bus operators and bus Commuters in Zambia and also from nearby countries as we want to offer the services in the southern region of Africa through the buses which cross the borders. The challenge prize will enable us to pay for office space, pay the system developer, buy furniture, a computers and to also meet our advertising costs. Furthermore, few employees for a start will need to be hired so that the operations can start and run smoothly and they will also need to be paid in the short ran before business becomes self-sustainable. The innovation will keep the environment clean as stationery or paper will not be used which litters the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to be used through mobile or web. It is fully responsive meaning that it can be used on any device (mobile phone, tablet and computer). The prototype which exists is a fixed product of the system and is currently being tested on its functioning. Once we find funding, the proposed implementation plan is has follows;
Quarter 1 (2022):
•	Go live with application (Business begins)
•	Get office space
•	Secure strategic alliances with radio stations
Quarter 2 (2022):
•	Further add more feature to the application 
•	Intensify marketing campaign and target a wider scope of customers
Quarter 3 (2022):
•	Hire additional staff
•	Reflect on business performance, decide what is not working for us and what is. 
Quarter 4 (2022):
•	Have a meeting with all stakeholders.
•	Open branches in other areas
Quarter 1 (2023):
•	Expand business by adding more bus operators
•	Look for more distribution partners 
Quarter 2 (2023):
•	Conduct road shows
•	Launch station ranking based on gathered marketing research on audience measurement
Quarter 3 (2023):
•	Add more features to the application
Quarter 4 (2023):
•	Increase marketing campaigns around our services because we project to have competitors by this time

> Anticipated Social Impact

Getting an inter-City bus ticket is challenging as it involves physically going to the bus station even on a rainy day or else a reservation cannot be made.  It also requires making long queues which are time-consuming as well as tiring and costly as it involves movements and fighting traffic. Booking tickets via telephone is also hectic task because the telephone lines remain either out of service or busy most of the time. About $700,000 is spent a year in total just on transportation to and from bus stations to purchase tickets in advance before departure day and time which takes 60 minutes on average each day per person. To address this problem we have created EaziBook Africa, a Mobile and Web Bus Ticket Booking application which allows commuters to check for buses and seats available online, make payment online and receive an e-ticket via email containing a QR Code.
