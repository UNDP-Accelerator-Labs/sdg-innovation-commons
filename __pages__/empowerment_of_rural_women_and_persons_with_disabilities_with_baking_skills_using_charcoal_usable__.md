> Brief description of the innovation

Empowerment of rural women and persons with disabilities with baking skills using charcoal usable ovens is a project developed and focused on rural women and persons with disabilities in mpongwe district.
Mpongwe rural district, like many rural districts in Zambia is one of the underserved districts. With a significant number and women and persons living with disabilities, It is inevitable to envision the challenges that local women and persons living with disabilities are facing.
Being the CEO of Zambia rural women empowerment foundation, It has always been my focus to achieve inclusion of women and persons living with disabilities in social and economic development. With the aforementioned goal of empowering local women and persons with disabilities by 2025, I developed this project to empower women and persons with disabilities with baking skills using charcoal usable ovens for free.
Many areas of the district have no access to electricity. Therefore I will be using charcoal usable ovens to demonstrate and teach the local women and persons with disabilities baking skills. Hence improving their livelihoods

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project is aimed at improving the livelihood of local women and persons with disabilities. Previously baking was a challenge due to inaccessibility to electricity in many parts of the district. With the introduction of this project ,the target group will be able to bake scones,buns,cakes which can be sold to the local people  in markests,bus station and local schools at affordable prices.Cakes will be advertised on online platforms.Baking and delivery will be on order basis.
The fund provided will be used to purchase the ovens,charcoal ,baking ingredients ,book a venue,purchase a handwashing stand,facemasks,pens  plain papers ,lunch and transport.The training will be done for free. The ovens range from 450 kwacha to 1500 kwacha each.
The innovation will not only help to provide food for the target group, but it will also enable them to pay school fees for their school going children.
The innovation will further utilize already used charcoal for reuse.therefore reducing land pollution

> Technical Feasibility

The ovens are made with metals. They have three layers.The top and down areas are used to insert charcoal, while the baking trays are inserted in the middle. Monitoring heat production is very important in order to avoid burning the products.
The organisation currently has one oven available, nonetheless, I will need to purchase 30 ovens to teach and distribute to the local target group in the first phase.
I will select and organize the local target group and meet at new beginning gardens for a 5 day workshop.
I will book the place,provide hand washing stand,plain papers, pens,charcoal, baking ingredients. The training will be done for free

> Anticipated Social Impact

Women and persons living with disabilities are the most marginalized groups of people in mpongwe district. While some are breadwinners, others have been victims of gender based violence. With little to no resources for economic empowerment,most women have opted for gender based silence.With an opportunity for economic empowerment, the target group will be able to be independent, raise their self esteem ,take their children to school and eat at least three meals per day.
Ibenga market only has one bakery available. This innovation will help reduce the price of confectioneries by providing alternative access to baked items.The local people will further have available and easily accessible breakfast from the trained target groups.
