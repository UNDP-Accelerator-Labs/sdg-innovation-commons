Open Digital Stack for Air Pollution in 2 Cities of India
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Evidence on point sources of air pollution are not available in India. So environmental agencies don't have clarity on what lies within/outside their jurisdiction to act upon. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Air pollution is a silent killer! Globally, poor air quality is estimated to cause about 7 million deaths each year (Source: Lancet). This crisis escalates the risk of various cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Beyond the staggering human toll, air pollution inflicts economic losses through decreased labor productivity, increased health expenditures, and diminished crop and forest yields. In 2018, a report quantifying the cost of air pollution from fossil fuels revealed a staggering $2.9 trillion expense, equating to 3.3 percent of the world's GDP. In India, the impact is alarming, with approximately 1.67 million deaths attributed to air pollution in 2019, constituting 17.8% of the country's total deaths.

A large proportion of air pollution is caused by fossil fuels that are also sources of carbon emissions. These fuels are a main source of three major air pollutants - NOX, SO2 and PM2.5, and the largest contributor to India’s CO2 emissions. While exact source apportionment for particulate matter is different for each region and widely debated among scientific communities, the major sources of air pollution are well known as – vehicular emissions, waste and biomass open burning, construction and road dust, industrial emissions and agricultural waste burning. In each of these categories, there are large number of sources of air pollution scattered over large geographies in India.

Detection of precise sources of air pollution remains a fundamental challenge faced by the ecosystem. Collective understanding and coordinated action by diverse stakeholders, including government agencies, industries, civil society, and citizens, are imperative to combat air pollution, necessitating new approaches, collaboration, and toolkits.

In this era of Fourth Industrial Revolution, data innovations powered by frontier technologies like IoT, AI/ML, Space tech etc., are transforming economic sectors and unravelling complexities. An illustrative example is an AI technology experiment conducted in Bihar, where UNDP collaborated with the University of Nottingham to create the GeoAI platform. This innovative platform combines remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and citizen science to identify the exact locations of brick kilns, responsible for up to 14% of air pollution in Bihar. The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) championed the implementation of this technology, supported by Development Alternatives  (NGO). Through data cooperation and partnerships, GeoAI demonstrated how environmental non-compliance could be detected from space using artificial intelligence, thereby reducing the regulatory burden and investment required for inspecting every industry. The GeoAI technology is built-to-scale and has already detected more than 47000 brick kilns across the Indo-gangetic belt.

Building on this success, AccLab India and collaborating organizations aim to expand data innovations through hyperlocal mapping of air pollution sources, aiming to create a first-of-its-kind 'open digital stack' informing about point sources of air pollution. This collaborative innovation will next showcase the combined power of IoT, citizen science, and AI in creating hyperlocal maps of air pollution, targeting point sources within Patna and Gurgaon cities. Supported by GIZ's Lacuna Fund, this initiative will demonstrate an open digital stack for air pollution, enabling collective action among diverse actors of the ecosystem.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Can an "open digital stack on air pollution" contribute 

Point sources of air pollution are not available in India. So agencies don't have clarity on what is in their jurisdiction to act upon. 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The proposed project leverages on citizen scientists collecting structured and unstructured data from field, use

of IoT based sensor data, data labelling and modelling using AI/ML algorithms which is a novel approach of obtaining hyperlocal data on emissions and even locate exact sources of air pollution and climate change thereby allowing for

targeted actions by regulatory authorities, government agencies, civil society, private sector and citizens at large. Generalized programs with one-size-fits-all approach have been implemented in the past to combat emissions which did not have significant impact. Further governments have been investing in capital intensive monitoring stations to improve the resolution of emissions data.

With the new approach of hyperlocal data collected with the help of low-cost sensors, citizen science and

AI-powered modelling, we plan to curate India’s first digital stack on Air Pollution and GHG emissions. With this we can expect more targeted actions and customized solutions supported by large-scale predictions. This novel approach

can become the catalyst to combat emissions at a fraction of public investments.  

 

 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



In one of the recent initiatives, UNDP AccLab India has partnered with Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), University of Nottingham and Development Alternatives to develop and implement ‘GeoAI to target brick kilns from space’. This innovation has mapped 47,000 brick kilns that contribute to 8-15% of emissions and air pollution in the region. This was done using citizen science, satellite data and object detection algorithms. A second round of citizen science was applied to classify brick kilns into environmental compliant and non-complaint ones to generate training data for AI-based image classification.

The government regulator (BSPCB) has received such targeted intelligence for the first time, pertaining to the exact location of brick kilns in the state and their status of environmental compliance. The regulator then adopted GeoAI for state-wide implementation to conduct field validation and initiated action against non-compliant brick kilns which has led to reduced emissions from brick kilns.

UNDER THIS NEW INITIATIVE:

We envisage the benefits from the proposed project will be on similar lines of the impact of GeoAI platform and

multi-fold impact with the integration of all major sources of emissions.

For instance, the data collection on solid waste dumps or construction dust will help train AI/ML models to locate

and quantify similar locations (objects) over larger geographies of Northern India. This in-turn allows monitoring of fires/emissions in these specific locations in real-time with latest satellite imagery, automated data modelling

and enable timely regulatory action. 

Another important use-case is publishing of data collected as open data and field insights as knowledge

stories which are powerful means for citizen awareness, community monitoring and local-level actions.  

UNDP would also co-invest and facilitate a brain trust along with research &amp; civil society partners to find source-specific and site-specific clean tech solutions for industries to switch to cleaner technologies.
