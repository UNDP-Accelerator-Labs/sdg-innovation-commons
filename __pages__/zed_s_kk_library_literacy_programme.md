> Title of the innovation

ZED's KK Library Literacy Programme

> Brief description of the innovation

ZED aims to attempt ‘Andragogy’ approaches to literacy. Adults that can’t read and write will find it difficult to thoroughly participate in their children’s learning process. Our ‘Pedagogy’ approach will enable children to explore the vast array of knowledge available to help them understand the fundamentals of life and living through different variations. 
The aim of ZED is to enhance the ability of people to learn and want more from life than they generally aspire. The reading culture and excitement to learn in our country is generally climbing the ladder of embraced education slowly. The dream of the organization is to speed up the process. The main goal is to help people find their purpose by learning more about themselves and the need they have to satisfy to develop our great nation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The benefits and/or impact of this program cannot be measured fiscally. The societal impact in skills and competency will speak for each project.

> Technical Feasibility

Many interventions for reading have been attempted in the past, but none as multi-faceted as ZED's Programme has been attempted in our community. The plan is to work with and through community and government schools. Supplying them with reading material and establishing projects that enhance the competencies of the participants. Partnering with the community and education institutions to serve the people.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Socially we'll improve the reading culture and also eliminate illiteracy and ignorance.
