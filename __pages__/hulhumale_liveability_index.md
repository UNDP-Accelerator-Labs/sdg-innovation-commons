## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Poor status of the data ecosystem in the Maldives led to the use of alternative sources data sources (Google places API and Sentinel Hub) to bridge in the missing data gaps.The liveability index as a prototype study raised working awareness among Urbanco (partner agency), other government authorities and SoEs on the type of information required on an ongoing basis to update the index that would ultimately assist in effective urban management. 

Access to the Data Dashboard, that tracks progress along various dimensions, could be beneficial to several government agencies for streamlining their strategic priorities which depends on the effective collection and dissemination of information. Currently there are nearly 80 indicators that are missing data in pending requests to different authorities that can greatly impact the overall index score. 

The Citizen Perception Survey as part of the Index score reflects public sentiments and serves as an important tool to address current and future gaps in the data environment that impacts the calculation of a reliable administrative data score. This survey needs to be conducted on a timely basis to ensure that the index score remains relevant. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

A knowledge sharing session was hosted for four city councils of Maldives and other stakeholders who were consulted at different stages of the initiative. These city councils and mayors from regional cities have expressed their interest in collaborating with UNDP and Housing Development Corporation (Urbanco) to work in the island city liveability space. UNDP Maldives together with Urbanco is extending our collaboration by working towards leveraging UNDP Strategic Plan enablers (Digitalization and Strategic Innovation), to demonstrate a development paradigm for resilient island cities, with other regional cities as additional partners.  

We are in the final stage of confirmation for resources from a Multilateral Development Bank and additional co-financing from Urbanco to develop a full programme. AccLab will develop the project which set to be 4th programme priority for the country office in the 2024 Business plan. This will be testing a new working modality for AccLab within the CO where AccLab partially implements the project while making room for R&amp;D and testing of innovative solutions within the project.

## Data and Methods

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Data Visualisation: The liveability index dashboard visualises how various data from different sources categorised under different pillars contributed to the overall liveability index of Hulhumale’, demonstrating the importance of data in quantifying certain aspects of urban living. Dashboard is perceived as a resource by Urbanco and other government stakeholders and investors for decision making. Access to this Data Dashboard, that tracks progress along various dimensions, is beneficial to several government agencies for streamlining their strategic priorities, as well as for investors and businesses.
