## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Jointly analyze the spatial and temporal variation of the Earth's magnetic field through measurements carried out in secondary schools in different parts of the country. 
## Specific goals

Characterize the Earth's magnetism and the factors contributing to its spatial and temporal variability in Argentina. 

Promote the participation of students in the collection of experimental data that can be shared with those collected by students from different places in the country. 
## Description of citizen participation

Measurements are obtained in work groups with the guidance of a teacher and are performed in areas free from magnetic interference within the educational institution. The project organizes training sessions where details and instructions are provided to carry out the measurements. To participate, students use their mobile phones to perform measurements and learn the concept of “magnetic dipole.” Finally, the students compare the measurements taken in the same place at two different times.
