## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

(1)The private sector in North Macedonia is not well informed about the SDGs and the Agenda 2030; there have been some attempts for various players in the ecosystem, through various channels (Media (39%) and international organizations (26%) are the main channel of communication for the companies to become aware and learn more on the SDG topic. Only 2% of the respondents were informed by the state institutions), but with a limited scope (51 % of the companies part participated in the research are not aware of SDGs) (2)When SDG language translated to the language of values, many of the private sector was able to answer the questions on what they are doing on Agenda 2030 (3) SDGs and the Agenda 2030 is a top-down approach in the private sector in North Macedonia (4) The ecosystem is vibrant, and there are increasing number of young startups from North Macedonia participating in accelerator programs and competitions that promote SDGs and the Agenda 2030 in international scene. (5) While SDGs and Agenda 2030 remain a jargon of the UN, the companies are able to recognize value in the work and would be willing to report and measure progress in specific areas if properly guided and supported. In the Focus groups with various chamber of commerce it was noted that if there are government supported guidelines on how the private sector to adopt the SDGs, such trainings and workshops can be delivered by them.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The field of the SDGs and partnerships with the private sector in North Macedonia is not explored, and remains mostly on observations, and data referring to the secondary sources. This was targeted through collection of primary data with the help of the contracted service, which proved to be the gate openers to the large companies, as well as to the targeted sample. Private sector is very wide, and very challenging to create a representative sample. After numerous discussions and consultations, we were able to tailor the research and derive the sample based on few categories. The sample size constitutes of different size, performance, and sector, which gave an overall solid background to derive hypothesis. In order to generate representative sample, we started thinking outside the box and created focus groups with chamber of commerce where most of the SMEs in the country are members, thus through this modality we represented their opinion.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is a general gap in the data concerning the private sector partnerships for the SDGs in North Macedonia.  The reporting on the SDGs are done on governmental level, and this is backed up the VNRs that are carried out periodically. The UN RC office conducted a study of financing the SDGs; and a white space on the primary data on SDGs and the engagement of the private sector. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We lacked primary data, and thus it was important to address this need. The primary data provides many insight for various stakeholders, and thus other methods may be used when working separately with specific groups. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In this area we worked mainly with the private sector, and made partnerships with Chambers of Commerce Seavus Accelerator, Business Impact Lab, as well as the established Pricewaterhouse Coopers. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All of the partners are new to UNDP in CO North Macedonia; namely working with the Seavus Accelerator and the Business Impact Lab for the Accelerate 2030 program was a new experience for the work in this area. Partnerships with the private sector in North Macedonia are very limited and this was an opportunity to shape the experience of the new startups in the ecosystem as well as help them become more competitive in the global scene with the targeted SDG that they impact. In addition, through partnership with PwC we were able to tap into the network of the private sector, as well as reach out the larger number of respondents in our attempts to collect primary data on SDGs, awareness and involvement of the private sector in the ecosystem. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This was the first time someone in the ecosystem generates first hand primary data on the SDGs and the private secotr in North Macedonia. The finding are very interesting and can build further the mechanisms for SDG reporting but also align partnerships with the private sector for Agenda 2030.
