Sakhipur, is a 33,000-inhabitant town in Tangail District, Bangladesh with very poor sanitation. Sakhipur’s sanitation situation was such that sludge was either left in full pits and septic tanks, or emptied and discharged unsafely, causing environmental contamination and health concerns. Solid waste management was complex due to limited treatment. The pourashava (municipality) is responsible for Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) services as well as solid waste management, yet small towns usually do not have the adequate human resources, budget or incentives to deal with the issue. To address this challenge, WaterAid Bangladesh (WAB) and the Bangladesh Association for Social Advancement (BASA) have supported Sakhipur Municipality both technically and financially to analyse the situation; evaluate potential options; and establish a co-composting plant in 2015, which became operational in 2016. The plant treats both faecal sludge and organic waste to produce good quality compost, sold to local farmers. This came alongside improvements along the sanitation chain, such as better faecal sludge emptying with Vacutug motorised pumps, recruiting waste transport workers, and encouraging source separation of organic waste. This solution was chosen given the current waste streams and especially given the high demand for compost coming from neighbouring farmers.
