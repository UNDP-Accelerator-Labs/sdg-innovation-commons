## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Generating new knowledge about a system: thinking big but doing small 2. Reframing the problem by embracing many forms of expertise 3. Building a transformation ecosystem 4. Process before the structure 5. Financial mechanism will play a crucial role in the process of implementing a portfolio

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

It is time consuming to explain the process of designing and implementing a portfolio to key partners; it requires a lot of reading and thinking and sharing learnings between different actors. Also, assembling a proper team of the international experts who could help us to address this issue from the global and local perspective was a challenge.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

n/a

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

All these methods and methodologies helped us in reframing and unpacking the problem. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

 DEPOPULATION PORTFOLIO: "Belgrade Gets Digital" and "Returning Point" organisations as our entry points of the portfolio (testing new projects and initiatives)  

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

DEPOPULATION PORTFOLIO: The Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital, Vienna International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Vienna University of Vienna

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

DEPOPULATION PORTFOLIO: World data Lab (Vienna) helped us in understanding the issue by providing new data overviews on the issue of depopulation  PRIVATE SECTOR PORTFOLIO: Deloitte through the innovation facility Deep Demonstration helped us in designing and developing the SMEs portfolio  

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

- UNDP’s engagement on the issue of depopulation was requested by the President of the Republic in 2019. UNDP and UNFPA have been working together on developing the approach since early 2020.  - The team has sustained engagement with the President's office. The Prime Minister has been briefed in May 2021 and has expressed unequivocal support for taking the work forward and appointed a focal point for the next steps. Individual relevant ministers have been informed of the approach and evolving portfolio through regular meetings that UNDP and UNFPA had with them during the last year, as well as the Prime Minister’s leadership on the issue. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

DEPOPULATION PORTFOLIO: Vladan Joler as a co-founder of the Share Lab and globally recognized visual tech artist helped us in the process of visualisation the portfolio

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

DEPOPULATION PORTFOLIO: UNFPA as a strategic partner in building a Depopulation portfolio. UNDP and UNFPA have worked together to develop the draft of the portfolio - the narrative and visual representation, including the intervention logic, mapping of existing interventions, and potential entry points.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The mix of methods, new partners and data helped us engage in questioning, observing, and associational thinking (connected seemingly unconnected ideas) together with storytelling
