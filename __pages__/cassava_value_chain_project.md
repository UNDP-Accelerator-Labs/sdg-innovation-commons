Cassava is increasingly being used for different purposes including in the processing of leather industry, paper production, glue production and ethanol production. This provides opportunities for small scale farmers to provide the cassava, which in some parts of the country is grown in great quantities.

The innovation has designed a value chain that will link small scale cassava farmers to the market, while ensuring the farmers benefit from the value chain. The model will provide a stable market for cassava and promote cassava farming as a business.
