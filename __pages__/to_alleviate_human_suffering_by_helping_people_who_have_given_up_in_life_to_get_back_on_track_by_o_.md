> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will generate an income through the Levi which will be gotten before and after the project is done and the monthly subscription to be of the innovation. This will run for about a period of 4 to 6 years by then you will fine that the starting capital was already return in the first month of the project.

> Technical Feasibility

In order to be successful, an innovation must satisfy a customer need. Innovations often don't bring the desired success because they don't bring real benefits to the customer or are aimed at the wrong target group. Lego's crowd-based business model is a vivid example of how customer needs can be optimally addressed by involving Lego customers in the innovation process.

On the other hand, the BIC Women's Underwear - an underwear for women that is disposed of after use - was an absolute miss on the theme. The BIC perfume also flopped. And the ready-to-serve menus from toothpaste manufacturer COLGATE also failed to win over customers.

An example of the choice of the wrong target group is the whirlpool, which was developed by the Jacuzzi brothers in the 1950s. They initially marketed the innovative pool unsuccessfully to arthritis sufferers. The business only blossomed when they changed the target group and began to sell the whirlpool as a luxury good to the wealthy.

 

2. Relevant differentiation from the competition

Is your solution superior in one relevant aspect?

An innovation must differentiate itself from the competition and be distinguished by at least one unique feature. This differentiating feature should be highly relevant for the user and should be able to be maintained in the long term.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By making sure that everyone is empowered with a skill it means each and every family will have someone to rely on financially and in turn the community will free from hunger and suffering.
