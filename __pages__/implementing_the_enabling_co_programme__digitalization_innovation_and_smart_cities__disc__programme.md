## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

We discovered the following during this Action Learning Plan: 

1. Co-creation of digital solutions with the end-users was very critical to design fit-for-purpose digital solutions. For example, we co-created with traders as well as Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives to design platforms that are not only facilitating Export trade, but also support market intelligence to facilitate Business to Business exchanges as well as connections between Ugandan Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and counterparts in other countries. The diversity of traders helped us come up with a beta version of this platform can be accessed on this link https://undp-b2b.doctracker.co/    We also used the same approach to design an e-learning platform for self-paced learning for MSMEs. A beta version of this platform can be accessed on this link https://digitalskillsforsme.com 

2. Ethnographic data helped us to understand the magnitude of digital divide in the different regions of the country. Field visits helped us understand why certain digital solutions designed by the private sector are not taken on by citizens. For example, while trying to make sense of the digital gaps in the country to inform the national Digital Transformation Roadmap, we discovered that cultural norms among other factors should also be considered while designing digital solutions for particular parts of the country. We found out that a number of things need to be tackled if Uganda is to achieve Digital Transformation The National Digital Transformation Roadmap has the components of designing the Big Data utilization Strategy and the Digital Skilling Programme to facilitate improved service delivery in both public and private sectors. . This is still work in progress and we are expecting to register more lessons from this activity. 

3. Scaling work from the previous learning cycle of connecting the Informal market vendors to the Online e-commerce platform also gave us some insights under the DISC programme. We are facilitating the designing of the E-Commerce Policy to facilitate an enabling ground for E-trade to thrive in the country. While we were connecting the market vendors on the Jumia's E-commerce platform, many other online trading platforms emerged in the country, not only as a result of competition, but as a new way of trading that people discovered was convenient during the COVID 19 pandemic. Beyond the pandemic, more and more e-commerce platforms are emerging, providing not only convenience to the people, but also widening the market base to the traders.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

We experienced both programmatic and operational bottlenecks. For example, for the Programmatic  bottlenecks, the fact that DISC is an enabling programme to be implemented in a period of 5 years (CPD) cycle, we had to create more and more mini learning loops on various activities as stipulated in the Programme Document. This was difficult to follow, through. The operational bottlenecks were the usual long processes of requisitioning for activities to be implemented.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Ethnographic data helped us to understand the magnitude of digital divide in the different regions of the country. Field visits helped us understand why certain digital solutions designed by the private sector are not taken on by citizens. For example, while trying to make sense of the digital gaps in the country to inform the national Digital Transformation Roadmap, we discovered that cultural norms among other factors should also be considered while designing digital solutions for particular parts of the country. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used Collective Intelligence for all the mini learning loops of the different activities to be implemented under the DISC Programme. This methodology helped us to acquire diverse knowledge and different solutions to addressing the challenge. It helped us identify the existing gaps in the digital and innovation space within the country and this informed our learning questions which influenced our results.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Federation of Small and Medium Enterprises (FSMEs). Helped in the mobilization of the informal MSMEs to participate in the co-creation of Digital Solutions.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked and are still working with Makerere University to Curate a Multidisciplinary Innovation Pod to support research and incubation of start-ups from the research done at the University. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the following Private Sector Companies 1. Hostalite Uganda Limited to Co-design the MSMEs Business to Business market intelligence Platform 2. Start-up Blink to Co-design the National Startup Strategy  3. Morifem Limited to Co-design the Self-paced E-learning platform for traders,  4. Centenary Technologies, Co-design that national Digital Transformation Roadmap 5. Utility Strategies Limited to facilitate the design of the National E-commerce Strategy/policy

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

1. Ministry of ICT and National Guidance to facilitate the design of the National Digital Roadmap. 

2. Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, to facilitate the co-creation of the digital solutions for traders and the design of the National E-commerce Strategy and Policy 

3. Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU) helped to mobilize the different Private Sector companies.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The informal traders were new and unusual partners to be involved in matters of policy formulation.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNCDF and UN Pulse Lab supported us in the exploratory stage of making sense of the data and synthesize the solutions that have been implemented in the Digitalization and innovation sectors. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We used Collective Intelligence methods mostly. This method helped us use its approaches like crowdsourcing to source for data, to analyze and make sense of the problem. We also used ethnography to understand certain behavior patterns of people in appreciating digital technology. And Co-creation helped in designing fit-for-purpose digital solutions.
