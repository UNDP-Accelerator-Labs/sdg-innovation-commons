## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Infodemic 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand what aspects and strategies help the population make informed decisions regarding vaccination, in a context of rapid and massive dissemination of inaccurate information.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

According to the WHO, the COVID-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic, that is, an excessive amount of information - in some cases correct, in others not - that makes it difficult for people to find reliable sources and reliable guidance when they need. The term infodemic refers to a large increase in the volume of information related to a particular topic, which can become exponential in a short period due to a specific incident such as the current pandemic. In this situation, misinformation and rumors appear on the scene, along with the manipulation of information with dubious intentions.   Recently, there has been a global increase in the spread of misinformation that has affected the scientific community and citizens. This has gotten progressively worse with the public health crisis arising from the coronavirus (COVID-19) where the effects of misinformation are beginning to be felt.   Uncertainty and misinformation are central aspects of the new normal, and a failure to address these issues can undermine public policy efforts.

There are many people who are not sure about getting vaccinated or are strongly opposed to it. Often this is because they have heard incorrect information about the vaccine or its effects. According to a report from the UNDP Citizen Perception Plant in Uruguay, with data from January 2021, only 56% of the population would be willing to be vaccinated once the coronavirus vaccine is available in Uruguay.

We are now in a situation of great uncertainty with daily news publications and fake news. According to the government's vaccination plan: "Among the problems/challenges identified is acceptability, adherence to vaccination, lack of efficacy and safety data."    Uncertainty remains regarding the type of vaccines that will arrive in our country, and confidential negotiation processes with companies promote misinformation scenarios.    Furthermore, uncertainty, ignorance, or fear associated with vaccination against COVID-19 could generate a loss of confidence in the national vaccination program and weaken immunization plans against other diseases. Misinformation on social media is associated with a drop in vaccination rates over time and negative discussion of vaccines on social media.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab in Uruguay has already run two experiments regarding COVID-19, analyzing the effectiveness of different media and messages to raise awareness among the Uruguayan population. This leaves a precedent to continue working in the area, developing new experiments, and taking advantage of the generated alliances and learnings.   Furthermore, the team has experience working in these fields before joining the Lab, both in the scientific sector and in the entrepreneurship and social sector. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are working on understanding the aspects and strategies that could help people make informed decisions regarding vaccination in a context of rapid and far-reaching spread of accurate and inaccurate information.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What aspects and strategies help people make informed decisions regarding vaccination in a context of rapid and far-reaching spread of accurate and inaccurate information?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

- We will use Collective Intelligence methods in order to gain insights of different strategies that could influence people's decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination without affecting their freedom of choice. We will promote critical thinking in the population, to engage in reflective and independent thinking.   


- We will use Data Ethnography methods with the purpose of understanding people, groups, and organizations’ perceptions about COVID-19's vaccines that will be provided in our country. Also, with the objective of   identifying grassroots innovations and other solutions that deal with misinformation.


- We will use Behavioral Insight to influence the way citizens participate in public health issues and decision-making and influencing the way they behave regarding vaccines.   


- We will build several MVPs to experiment and probe different methods, strategies and solutions that could ensure transparency and clear information that may contribute with informed decision-making by the population.   


- We will use Gamification to bring game dynamics into a nongame environment, like the vaccine information with the purpose to increase knowledge and citizen participation. We want to engage and empower citizen with this thematic, so we need to try different mechanisms. 


- We will use Gamification to bring game dynamics into a nongame environment, like the vaccine information with the purpose to increase knowledge and citizen participation. We want to engage and empower citizen with this thematic, so we need to try different mechanisms. 





> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We can use the data in order to understand what is driving people to make certain decision regarding vaccines.  Social network data: we can analyze what people say, think, and share in social networks.  Citizen data: we can use microsoft forms to raise the voice of the people. We can generate ethnographic expreiences, for sense pgase of the learning cycle as a qualitative input in the experimental design. We can also use previous work generated by UNDP with a percpection panel survey about behaviours in pandemic times as an insight for the portfolio design.
