> Description of the solution

5G-enabled farming robot was launched in East China's Fujian province in 2019. It moves in a greenhouse, gathering data about plants and feeding it back to a control room. Developed by the Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Fujian Newland Era Hi-Tech Co., Ltd., it aims to build "Autonomous running farms." The robot has a round base with wheels for all-directional movement and is equipped with cameras and sensors on its head to detect various environmental factors. High-quality data gathering is the first step, and with AI algorithms under development, it can potentially determine plant health, pest control conditions, and pick fruit in the future. It has been connected to 5G signals from China Unicom for tests, and the ultimate goal is to achieve "manless farms" by deeply integrating the robot into the agricultural process to assist in management decisions.
