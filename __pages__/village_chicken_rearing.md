> Title of the innovation

Village Chicken Rearing

> Brief description of the innovation

Village Chicken Rearing will include different varieties or breeds. For egg production black Anstrolopes are recommended for higher production rate. About 5000 black Anstrolopes will be required to meet the rate of 100 trays of eggs per day for better income generation, and to help meet the target market. An incubator with a capacity of about 3000 eggs is needed for the production of chicks every month. This will help meet the demand of village chickens at the market making the business self sustainable. A big poultry house with different compatiments to separate chickens in accordance with their sizes is required. This will eventually help yield large numbers of chicken to be sold every month to nearby communities and other customers.
Feed will be made using local produces such as maize, soyabeans, sunflower, vegetables, and other leftover foods. If possible a grinding Mill is required to help in feed production. This will help to reduce costs of feed. Drugs are also needed to help prevent deseases and will be administered at the appropriate time.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Village Chicken Rearing is a self sustaining business. With an incubator (for chick production), chicks would be sold to community members. Others will be sold when ready for relish. Eggs will be sold daily to locals, Lebanese, and chain stores. This will help create employment and employees will be paid accordingly. The production will not be broken and this will contribute positively to the economy of Zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

The main goal is to help reduce poverty levels in the community and lead to self sustained life as well as create employment to others. Transport is needed to deliver the products to customers on a daily basis.
 The implementation date is December, 2021 if everything will be in place by that time. 
Budget:
i. Building materials K30,000
ii. Borehole K30,000
iii. 5,000 black Anstrolopes K50,000
iv. Incubator K25,000
v. Feed (200 bags) K10,000
vi. Drugs K3,000
vii. Land K20,000
viii. Miscellaneous K10,000
Total: K178,000

> Anticipated Social Impact

Village Chicken Rearing will definitely create employment for the community members. This will help improve on their standards of living, nutrition, and healthy lives. With income available they'll be able to take their children to school and access proper health care services.
