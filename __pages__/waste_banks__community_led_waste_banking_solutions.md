> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that there is improper waste management in Dodoma and Zanzibar cities in Tanzania.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Genesis of the Challenge

The story of waste management in Tanzania is not just a narrative of growth and neglect but also one quantified by alarming statistics. Since the late 20th century, Tanzania has experienced rapid urbanization, with its urban population soaring. This growth is exemplified in cities like Dodoma and Zanzibar, which have seen their waste generation rates climb significantly. Dodoma, with its expanding urban sprawl, now generates upwards of 400 tons of waste per day, a figure that starkly contrasts with its collection and processing capabilities.

The Forces at Play

The escalation of waste management challenges in Tanzania is driven by a complex interplay of factors. The country's urban population has doubled over the last two decades, leading to an increase in waste generation that far outpaces the development of waste management infrastructure. In Zanzibar, the situation is exacerbated by the tourism sector, which contributes significantly to the island's 300 tons of waste produced daily. Only a fraction of this waste is properly collected and treated, leaving the majority to accumulate in informal dumpsites or, worse, in the natural environment.

The informal waste collection sector, while managing to collect approximately 30% of the waste generated in urban areas, operates without formal recognition or adequate support, leading to inefficient and often hazardous waste disposal practices.

The Current Landscape

Currently, Dodoma and Zanzibar face serious waste management crises. In Dodoma, only about 60% of the waste generated is officially collected, leaving the rest to pile up in unauthorized dumpsites or within communities. Zanzibar, despite its smaller size, faces a proportionally larger challenge due to its limited land area and the seasonal influx of tourists, which significantly increases waste generation beyond the island's capacity to manage.

The environmental impact is palpable, with marine pollution in Zanzibar not only affecting the coastal and marine ecosystems but also the tourism industry, which is vital for the local economy. In Dodoma, the lack of proper waste disposal facilities contributes to soil and water pollution, posing serious public health risks.

The Ripple Effects

The inadequacy of waste management in Tanzania leads to severe environmental, health, and economic repercussions. Unregulated waste disposal has resulted in significant soil and water contamination, with leachate from dumpsites penetrating water sources and affecting agricultural productivity. Public health is compromised, with communities exposed to waste experiencing higher rates of diseases associated with poor sanitation and waste management.

Economically, the failure to invest in recycling and waste-to-energy opportunities represents a missed opportunity. The potential revenue from recycling and waste conversion activities is estimated to be in the millions of dollars annually, funds that could support sustainable development and provide critical employment opportunities in both Dodoma and Zanzibar.

There are a few faint signals indicating the urgency and relevance of tackling Tanzania's solid waste management challenge. These modest clues highlight a developing dilemma that requires quick response for sustainable growth and environmental conservation.

1. Rapid urbanization is surpassing existing waste management infrastructure, leading to increased garbage generation. With metropolitan areas estimated to create around 26 million tonnes of solid trash per year by 2030, the burden on waste management systems is increasing.

2. Low Collection and Recycling Rates: With just 19% of garbage being recycled, significant amounts of waste remain uncollected and unprocessed, leading to environmental contamination and health concerns.

3. Inadequate Disposal Methods: The use of uncontrolled dumpsites indicates a lack of sustainable waste management procedures. More than 90% of Tanzania's MSW is disposed of in ways that pose substantial environmental and health risks, highlighting the vital need for the development and implementation of more sustainable waste disposal options.

4. Legislative and operational gaps: Waste management policies are not being implemented effectively. Despite comprehensive statutory frameworks, adherence to these regulations is low, indicating a considerable gap in authorities' enforcement capacities at all levels. This circumstance highlights the importance of better governance frameworks and increased capacity building among parties involved in trash management.

These weak signs are qualitative indicators of Tanzania's developing waste management crisis. They highlight the critical need for coordinated efforts to increase garbage collection efficiencies, boost recycling and waste-to-energy activities, and establish long-term disposal alternatives. Addressing these issues is crucial not only for environmental protection, but also for public health and economic development, making it a major frontier concern that requires immediate and ongoing attention.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Various studies have pointed out lack of appropriate data Tanzania solid waste managements systems to inform programming and decision making. There is minimal/ or no data related to 1) user opinions/views 2) number of households utilizing the system 3) willingness to pay for service 4) disaggregated solid waste type data 5) limited use of IT to link customers, aggregators. Collective intelligence ( Promoted perhaps by only the Acc Lab) through its methods therefore will help to generate new information that will lead to new ideas and hence help to embed new products or services that will improve the efficiency of the solid waste management systems in the city.

UNDP Acc Lab and its partners are testing the waste banks approach: A waste banks project, also known as a "waste bank," is an innovative environmental initiative designed to promote recycling and reduce waste in communities. It operates similarly to a traditional bank, but instead of dealing with money, it deals with waste materials. Here’s how it typically functions:

Collection: Community members collect recyclable waste at their homes, such as plastics, paper, metals, and glass.

Deposit: They then bring this waste to the waste bank at designated times.

Credit System: The waste is weighed, and its value is determined based on current market prices for recyclable materials. This value is credited to the depositor's account within the waste bank, akin to making a deposit in a financial bank.

Recycling: The collected waste is sold to recycling companies. The revenue generated can support the waste bank's operations and potentially provide financial returns or benefits to the depositors.

Education and Awareness: Waste banks often incorporate educational programs to increase awareness about waste management, recycling, and environmental conservation.

The primary goals of a waste banks project are to encourage community participation in waste reduction, enhance recycling efforts, promote environmental awareness, and foster sustainable waste management practices. Through these initiatives, waste banks aim to create a cleaner environment, reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfills, and support the circular economy by turning waste into a resource.
