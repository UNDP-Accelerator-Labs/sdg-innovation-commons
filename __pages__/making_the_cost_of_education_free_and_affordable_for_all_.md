> Title of the innovation

Making the cost of education free and affordable for all.

> Brief description of the innovation

In this system the Zambian people will only pay  a certain percentage of tuition fees in college and university based on their annual income. For example "if Mr X earns k10,000 annually then he will only pay k1,500 for his child to attend school" and Mrs Y earns k50,000 annually then she will only pay k7,500 for her child to attend school .So based on the annual income  people will pay a fraction of the cost.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation is their to remove one of the biggest challenges in the education sector which is money . If people are allowed to pay an amount that they can afford due to their financial status then we as a nation will see more people going to school and the  future of the individual and of the nation will improve in a positive direction.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation will give a certain percentage that an individual has to pay for school depending on his or her current financial status, on average students will pay 35% of their tuition . So the amount one has to pay for school will differ from one person to another("if ones annual income is more  than the other he or she will pay a 5.5% more than the other). This way if one can't afford to go to school some of the excess money from high earning individuals will be used to support the people who can't afford tuition fees.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will make education highly affordable. One key indicators of economic growth is how many youths graduate college and if we can increase the number of people educated then we will be one step closer to becoming a developed nation
