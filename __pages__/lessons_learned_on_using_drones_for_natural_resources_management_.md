## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

There is need to sensitize law makers on drone policy because presently drones are classified as national security, so most UN Agencies and development partners shy away from using them regardless of their demonstrated benefits

Drone data can be use to track wildlife poaching by mapping animal trails vs human trails. (needs AI)

The forestry commission needs capacity building in interpretation not collection. Interpretation is a bigger challenge which is contrary to what we thought.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

GCF will try to focus more on drone policy and capacity building on drone data interpretation rather than on purchase of drones for their projects. 
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

we had to establish a baseline to study the effect drone use had on mapping of indigenous forests
