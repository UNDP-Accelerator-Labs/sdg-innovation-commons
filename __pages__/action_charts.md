The action tables allow to present in a concrete way what are the objectives of the work team, what actions will be carried out to achieve these objectives, in charge of who will be, which entity will be responsible and what priority of execution they have.  


Priority is assigned through participatory voting processes, where each workshop participant has a vote and can decide depending on their perspective.
