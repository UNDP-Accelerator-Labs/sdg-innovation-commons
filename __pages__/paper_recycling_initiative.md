Penda is a company that collectes wasted papers and recycled into new paper products. The initiative installs 40 mobile paper waste deposit sites called ‘Worke’ around the city of Addis Ababa that allows city residents to dispose their paper waste for 2 Ethiopian birr per kilo.


Penda Manufacturing was established in 2014 by Marie Nielsen, has been working to ‘revolutionize Addis Ababa’s paper recycling industry. It has so far been working with micro-enterprises collecting the city’s waste and creating jobs for collectors and processors in the recycling plant.  Penda collects paper waste from over 130 offices and factories around the city and provides 4, 300 individuals organized under micro-enterprise with additional income, the volume collected is still insufficient.
