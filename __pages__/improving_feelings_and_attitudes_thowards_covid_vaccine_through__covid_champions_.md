## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn more about people's feelings and if their attitudes towards taking the vaccine would improve if they had a reliable person in their close environment for multilateral discussions (Covid Champions) who could clear their doubts.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis 1 “IF… More reliable information is spread through Covid Champions, THEN… more people will feel safer and more positive towards taking the vaccine”.  

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experiment was run for two weeks (Monday-Saturday) and included the Accelerator Lab, two hair salons in Bissau and technicians from Saudigitus. Two Covid Champions were recruited in two separate hair salons and received a basic training on Covid and the vaccine and started to interact with their clients. To become a champion the person already had to be fully vaccinated.  During the two weeks, the two Covid Champions provided information about Covid and the vaccination process to their clients. After the conversation, each person was asked to answer a pre-post survey of how their perception towards taking the covid vaccine had changed or not. The respondents rated their feelings and attitudes from 1-5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.  

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Accelerator lab analyzed the rating of the feelings and attitudes before and after the conversation with the covid champion. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Pre-post Survey

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 weeks

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

186 USD
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The results clearly showed that having a person in the immediate environment for multilateral discussions who can answer questions and clear doubts (Champions), has a positive impact on the population when it comes to educating about a disease as well as creating a feeling of security and trust.  The two hair salons we worked with were situated in the city center of the capital and clients can be considered wealthy. If the test had been placed in a different neighborhood or in the countryside, it is possible that would have had a larger impact. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

5 weeks

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

189 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No.

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The results clearly showed that having a person in the immediate environment for multilateral discussions who can answer questions and clear doubts (Champions), has a positive impact on the population when it comes to educating about a disease as well as creating a feeling of security and trust.   In relation to changing the action and behavior of people, the Covid Champions showed very little or no effect at all. No one of the respondents had completed their vaccination two weeks after the conversation with the Champion, something that was explained due to lack of time, commitment or mistrust from suffering severe effects from the first dose of vaccine. It is still possible that if respondents would have been given more time, they would have completed their vaccination.  The results also showed that there was a very low interest in the population itself of becoming a Covid Champion, and that the incentive system did not make a difference. The users explained that they felt that Covid is no longer “a real problem”, most of the people already know the causes and effects as well as the benefits of the vaccine and they felt that them becoming a Champion would not make a big difference. Additionally, users did not feel they had time to comit as they have other jobs and family to take care of. Reflecting on this result, one must consider that the hair salons we worked with, are situated in the city center of the capital and that the visiting clients are wealthy. If the test had been placed in a different neighborhood or in the countryside, or with a different type of incentive, it is possible that the incentive system might have had a different effect.   

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Communication with the data collection team. It was hard to explain how we wanted to conduct the test and we had several misunderstandings in our team. Political reasons for loosing a partner: the decision of the Government to close down the High Comissioner for Covid. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Health Cluster as they approached the Lab for this specific activity, but all clusters can learn from the Lab methodology of how to sense, explore and test without invetsing too much time and reasources. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Mainly the Ministry of Health as it shows the potential of the use and impact of "vaccination champions" in local communities to change attitudes and feelings thowards vaccination. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We adjusted the way the data collection was done two times due to initial misunderstandings in the team. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Make sure to establish good relationships with national partners and clusters to ensure continuation and scaling of the activity. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

 The concept of "Champions" can be used as a way to spread information and trust in communities for several of the SDGs or in other thematic areas ex. campaigns for washing hands or ending open defecation SDG6 Clean Water and Sanitation.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We spend a lot of time on the "explore" phase for this experiment. In order to optimize time, we often split the team. In the future I would liek to work closer to the other roles for a more dynamic process. 

> What surprised you?

How quick Design Thinking can give insights into the challenge and generate learnings.
