Pearlmed enterprise 
(Targetting people living with diabetes and Hypertension)

Pearlmed enterprise is a health ideation I would like to establish.The world today records that theres a number of people living with Diabetes and Hypertension and also most deaths are due to those who Blood pressure rise unexpectedly or those who've fallen into hypo/hyperglycemic coma,henceforth, I decided to come up with this small company that will be advertising drugs on behave of partnered pharmacies and drugs stores (antihypertensive and Diabetic drugs) and when bought, thier drugs will be delivered to them by us hence creating EMPLOYEMENT for youths.Apart from advertising and  delivering ,our company's website will also contain information which will educate people who've just been diagnosed with the main stated conditions and also ways on how they can control it hence reduce sudden deaths.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

So how will my innovation generate income?
This ideation will generate income as I will partner with small drug stores in advertising for them they'll be charged a very small fee for starters( for advertising for them and also helping them deliver drugs to customers who are far).And this fee will also help me pay fellow youths  whom I'll employ to deliver the same drugs and those who will be at the office.Also I believe other businesses (drug stores will develop because thier sales won't be limited but because of our advertisement they'll also be known country wide.
How are we going to be delivering?
For starters I plan on purchasing 3 bicycles and employ 3 youths whom I will be delivering with them..later we might start delivering using motorbikes.

My main targetted market are the people living with hypertension and Diabetes.We want to reduce sudden deaths by educating aswel as delivering drugs as fast as possible and inadvance for people living with the two diseases and also other diseases.

> Technical Feasibility

How is my innovation designed?
It will be an online thing but with offices where people can come and receive membership cards so that drugs are delivered to them anytime we are called.
We'll establish a website and APPLICATION where small drug stores will be advertised,get contacted and also all knowledge will found concerning the signs and symptoms of diseases, what a person with diabetes should do once they are in hyper/hypoglycemic coma.And also what people with hypertention should do once there blood pressure is high or too low.And also when delivering the drugs there Blood pressure and sugar levels will checked for free.
