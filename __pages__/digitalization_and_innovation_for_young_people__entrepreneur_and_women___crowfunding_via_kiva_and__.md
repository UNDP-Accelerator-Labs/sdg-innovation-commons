## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digitalization and Innovation for young people, entrepreneur and women : crowfuding via KIVA and a guinean microfinance institution
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to promote skills of people working in informal sector (young people, woman or entrepreneur) by proposing banking products adapted to their needs, more precisely crowdfunding.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Several factors explain this situation: inability of the populations to use financial and banking products due to the low level of education of adults over 15, the coverage of the territory by banking and financial institutions is rather disparate. Entrepreneurs and young people do not have an offer adapted to their profile, which means that their access to financing is almost non-existent

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The banking rate is low, it was 12,7% in 2020. 15-35 years old represent more than 70% of the population There are more than 15 commercial banks in Guinea and several microfinance institutions but no one offer crowdfunding The informal sector contributes more than half of the added value of Guinea's GDP Moreover, there's a low level of access to finance for SMEs and informal sector entrepreneurs.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Although there is a women's financial mutual, its resources come from donors and members. The women's financial mutual was born out of a desire to provide Guinean women working in the informal sector with financial instruments to meet their individual and family financial needs. The goal will therefore be to capitalize on this women's financial mutual and to offer crowdfunfing or "field partner". To do so, each entrepreneur must publish a presentation of his project as well as his profile to attract a financing loan from lenders; lenders can live in Guinea or elsewhere in the world. The goal is to mobilize the necessary funds that the entrepreneur will need. Our lab can complete this challange because labs methods are unique, quickly applicable and the most inclusives ones. We have even just supported the development of an application (in collaboration with the national agency for innovation and the digital economy) allowing women entrepreneurs to monitor their income, their expenses.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
