The reason Fish Aggregating Devices work is simple:  "Fish are fascinated with floating objects. They use them to mark locations for mating activities. They aggregate in considerable numbers around floating objects" To these fads we will attach satellite driven technology that will give us a lot of information about the fish movement etc but also about the ocean itself. The FADS will be used to increase fish catch for fisherfolk and to attract and maintain pelagic fish stock in the area, these include Amber Fish, Bonito, Dolphin (Mahi Mahi), Marlin, Rainbow Runners, Skipjack, Swordfish, Tuna, Turpics, and Wahoo (Kingfish).
