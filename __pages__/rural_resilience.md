## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.      Leveraging subsistence farming for food security. The current pressure on small-holder farming coupled with the hike in prices can have wide implications especially that the majority of farmers in Egypt are small. Small holder farming whether commercial or subsistence provides a safety and nutritional net for households and its disappearance may have impact on the food security not just in terms of providing food to the urban areas but also for that of the rural families. Small plots of land, birds and cattle provide richer diets for households without which they have weaker immune systems and are more vulnerable to diseases. This point was observed as giving up land, seizing to plant vegetables, reducing food consumption, and resorting to cheaper food options (ex: reliance on potatoes) were among the primary reactions to the discussed challenges.

2.      Diversifying Livelihoods and expanding into non-farm economies. Livelihood diversification is essential for rural communities to minimize the impact of risks, however a strategy of how to apply and increase the value and productivity of those additional livelihoods (cattle rearing, poultry farming, small projects, etc) will determine the degree of added resilience. In addition, small projects as a tool for resilience should not be considered as a silver bullet, especially for women, as not everyone can or want to manage a microbusiness. The creation of non-farm job opportunities, through the establishment of factories or workshops near rural areas is still needed, especially for those who want to exit the farm economy.

3.      Strengthening social protection. The combination of risks and precarious livelihoods that rural communities suffer from make the availability of just and inclusive social protection programmes imperative. Until a holistic gender-sensitive strategy is implemented to transform agricultural areas and livelihoods, many will still depend on safety nets. Social protection programmes such as Takaful and Karama act as stable and predictable income that can allow households to plan small payments, be able to put away some savings and guarantee a minimum cash-inflow during emergencies. The strengthening of those programmes and ensuring their effective and efficient implementation are currently central to be able to respond to the financial crisis that is hitting rural areas most.

4.      Accounting for the psychological and community elements. Policy and programming for rural development should not neglect the psychological and community dimensions in design, monitoring and evaluation. Unprompted, participants discussed psychological factors as tools for resilience such as spiritual fulfillment, self-esteem, and encouragement from loved ones. On the other hand, they also discussed them in relationship to reacting to hardships in the form of stress, anxiety, and despair. Community also ties in with the psychological and provides other modes of support through advice and emergency finance in addition having significant implications in the formation of norms and uptake of new solutions.

5.      Mobilizing agricultural extension services and cooperation among farmers. Many commercially oriented farmers are thirsty for technology and modernization techniques that can help them sustain their profits and be able to scale up in the face of price hikes, climate change and competition. To this end, it is necessary to mobilize knowledge, technological and energy alternatives solutions while encouraging and consolidating cooperative modalities among farmers to achieve economies of scale, have better access to credit, higher bargaining power and higher scale marketing. Higher value-added activities or new opportunities can also be introduced among farmers such as organic produce, fair trade, spices, and herbs taking into account marketing plans and saturation concerns (which can partially be mitigated through parentships with the private sector). Considerable attention also needs to be given to the large gap in knowledge services to capitalize on opportunities that utilize different means including word of mouth (through community leaders), radio, TV, hotlines and/or mobile applications or SMS messages.

6.      Designing tailored and meaningful financial services. When thinking about employing financial solutions for resilience, the broad range of products need to be considered; credit, savings, and insurance. It is needless to say that tailored credit solutions are needed for farmers with different capacities and modes of ownership to access modern agricultural methods and models. However, with credit, there needs to be meaningful financial literacy programs that can provide credible and effective information on risk, payment schedules and their alignment with income streams, alternatives to debt if needed, etc. Additionally, although saving is generally difficult with the low incomes of smallholder farmers but community-based and/or commitment and goal-oriented solutions (such as the gm’ya) could be the most convenient, especially if they target the younger population before they have familial financial burdens. Finally, even though insurance is not among the social norms in rural communities, it is essential to better manage risk. Therefore, the introduction of and/or awareness on insurance products for agriculture is a needed endeavor.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

This study mainly adopted a qualitative approach with a participatory direction. The main aim was to use methods that can leave room for exploration, accentuate communities’ voices, and offer deeper explanatory insights into rural resilience and finance.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

they helped get the nuanced stories and perspectives, which would help give more detail to how to better create services or programs for people in similar areas.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

we worked in three NGOs, and used a purposive sampling technique with the recruitment being done by partner NGOs who are trusted in their communities

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

we included private sector in the initial consultations and findings roundtable 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with small grants programme SGP to help with access to the NGOs.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

none but our interaction and the activities done with them were new

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with small grants programme SGP to help with access to the NGOs.
