> Title of the innovation

Currently running a farm in Palabana in which am involved in tomato plantation and a micro finance which is in need of working capital

> Brief description of the innovation

Am running tomato plantation in which I need to buy some drippers and drill a borehole. I also have microfilm which needs working capital for proper operation

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I have been selling about 30 crates of tomatoes weekly on a rented land, I have two workers for my tomato business and 3 workers manning the micro finance. My target market for tomatoes is locally Bauleni and my micro finance I have targeted micro business owners and those in employment.

> Technical Feasibility

My tomato business is located on small piece of land and the proposed new location is boarded by villagers who seasonal farmers due to lack of water. Organized farming with proper management would help develop my neighborhood by creating independent water sources as well as employment to the locals. 
The micro finance would help with employment and well managed working capital to the borrowers

> Anticipated Social Impact

Improve lively atmosphere for the locals as well as easily accessible funds hence improved lifestyle.

Well managed funding would also help by creating group farms on which all involved farmers would receive a certain stipend every season depending on productivity
