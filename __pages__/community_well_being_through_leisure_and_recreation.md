## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Community Well-being through Leisure and Recreation 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the lack of (social) community engagement platforms that promote good health and wellbeing within communities, which has been hindered by the i) lack of public leisure spaces ii) the COVID-19 pandemic iii) and interest/accessibility of affordable social gatherings/engagements.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In recent years, the number of community spaces reduced significantly throughout urban Gambia. In most communities, these spaces have been closed down, resulting in the deterioration of the few that were in existence and lack of interest among community residents. As a result, the 60% youth population in urban Gambia, and by extension communities at large, had limited access to conducive spaces for social gatherings, sporting events, leisure activities and etc. thereby compounding the effects already posed by limited extra curricula activities for young people, which had undesired effects within homes as well. The number of youths engaged in petty crimes and clandestine migration increased as a result, and also, exacerbated the number of youths suffering from mental illness due to increased stress levels, frustration, and hopelessness. This is a national issue which requires intervention at a public and local level, but also at a micro level within homes and in schools. The demographic most affected by these issues remain the youth, middle aged women, and the elderly.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

With our planned intervention involving the construction of a community recreation center specifically, an outdoor exercise/gym facility  and skatepark at a major epicenter of urban Gambia, we believe that we can positively impact the (good) health and wellbeing of youth, women, and the elderly. The center will include a multi-purpose skate park venue, and a variety of urban furniture (park benches / waste bins etc) in a sustainably powered and safe area, decorated with positive messages/visuals conveying the importance of being active. This would be a first-of-its-kind / out-of-the box unconventional project in The Gambia and UNDP in many regards, which only an entity like the Accelerator Lab could provide. Our approach will be inclusive in nature, with buy-in from the local municipality. As highlighted in the pervious sections which indicate the health issues plaguing our societies, the rise of crime and youth displacement, it is worth investing in this challenge because of the widespread impacts it could have for the country's most important resource, its citizens.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

If we introduce a community recreational center, would we be able to channel youth to more productive activities, encourage a healthier lifestyle for community members by promoting outdoor activities and change the perception of what it means to be happy through subliminal messaging.  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through the mapping of community assets with our local municipality we were able to identify the ideal location for this project given the existing roadmap of the municipality in question. Using a human-centered design approach and applying systems thinking, we will design a project under expert review, which plans to use behavioral insights and future analysis respectively to determine whether community actors would utilize the planned spaces and whether the messaging we share in these space would lead to a greater sense of community among the residents and users of the space. This will ultimately decide how we scale this project and inform our national partners on the impact it has for designing and improving community recreation centers throughout the country. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Drone & Satellite Data - addresses lack of drone footage mapping the entirety of community space for better ultilization through construction of the facilities.  Behavioral Nudge Messaging - addresses non-existent messaging for better lifestyle management through billboard and poster advertisement Observation - does not address a data gap except to provide new data on how community members utilize a novel space amongst their midst.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Beneficiaries - community residents; municipalities / National Youth Council and line Ministry in the Ministry of Youths and Sports; youth Possible Champions - Youths (inc. skaters); athletes (inc. wrestlers); (street) artists and musicians.
