> Brief description of the innovation

The BANTU MEDICAL AFRICANA concept is an innovative research organization designed to rapidly discover new cures for serious illnesses.
We have only one wish at BANTU MEDICAL AFRICANA
To discover new treatments for serious illnesses. This focus has led to the discovery of Thousands of promising Plant Medicines for tangle diseases that need to be processed for packaging.  

Our novel path to the discovery of Herbal Medicines has been exciting. Each step of this path, beginning from our Forefathers, has brought us closer humanity and to saving lives as we establish the BANTU MEDICAL AFRICANA.

The project is a systemic approach to assisting the growth of the Herbal Medicine industry.  
The project would empower to teach people to preserve and to collect Herbal Medicines that will be sold by BANTU MEDICAL AFRICANA. It is a project that would work with people who have Indigenous Knowledge as a National Resource.  

The project, will be conducted by BANTU MEDICAL AFRICANA, with aims to create a Herbal Growing and Preservation training course that will be provided to young men and women from different Zambian indigenous groups with the skills to become Herbal Growers, Creators and Herbal Cultural Entrepreneurs. By using new technologies to empower these communities, it will contribute to fostering and promoting indigenous cultural industries in the country.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

•	Launch a Preservation and Herbal Growing and Training Centres for indigenous People with courses in Herbal Growing and Preservation skills in Zambia.

Main activities:

•	Creating Training Programmes for Herbal Preservation in Zambia ; 
•	Setting up a course to train 3000 Indigenous Persons from each Chiefdom per year, in Indigenous Knowledge Transfer and communication; 
•	Organising Herbal Growing workshops and producing a Documentary  with the students attending the training course; and
•	Developing a visibility strategy for the promotion of this film in Zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

1.	Strategic planning – the development of a Herbal Medicine industry development strategy for the next three to five years;

2.	Herbal Medicine perseveration  training - a training the trainers (people trained to train others in Preservation Herbs and the Environment ) programme and the provision of Plant Medicine industry workshops on Herbal Medicines: - Preservation of Herbs, growing medical herbs including packaging, pest and disease awareness and control, and preparing Plant Medicines and other Herbal products for sale; and

3.	Herbal Medicine Industry support and extension – on-going training and technical support to:

i.	Assist in the fair distribution of Herbal Medicine knowledge - Develop and enhance Herbal Medicine  and management skills;

ii.	Promote Herbal Medicine as a sustainable form of agriculture leading to the trade of Plant Medicines  and other Herbal products;

iii.	Support and promote Herbal Medicines and the effective distribution of Herbal Plant Medicine  products for sale;

iv.	Assist in the development of manufacturing Herbal Medicines for packaging  and consumable Herbals items that are required for Plant Medicine management and Herbal production; and

v.	Assist, wherever practical, the education of government officials on the importance of Herbal Medicine preservation and Herbal production as a sustainable income generating practice. 


Consequently, for the project to be deemed successful, trainees would need to have learnt to be innovative and use materials around them to preserve and store Herbal Medicines rather than seeking to purchase imported Herbal Medicines and Herbal products from outside Zambia.  Also, the people with indigenous knowledge   would need to be generating income from Herbal Medicines and Herbal product sales.

Further to the above statement, the success of the BANTU MEDICAL AFRICANA  programme would be measured by:

•	Improved efficiency and sustainability of this form of agriculture – people preserving Herbal Medicines   rather than seeking out Herbal Medicines  and herbs in the wild;

•	An increased awareness, understanding and knowledge of Herbal Medicines and the issues relating to the trade of its Herbal products on the domestic market; 

•	Increased number of people in the region growing  herbs for generating income;

•	Increased levels of herbal products available to the domestic market;

•	Government agencies having an understanding of the issues relating to trade of Plant Medicines, Herbs and Herbal products;

•	Seek for funding to support further Herbal Medicine Preservation projects in all the Ten(10) Provinces of Zambia;

•	Increased food security and the alleviation of poverty; and

•	Established Plant Medicine Preservation Networks between Chiefdoms, participating Senior Citizens, and other stakeholders leading to potential Plant Medicine trade.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Herbal Medicine and Indigenous knowledge Preservation (Traditional Medicine) in this matter refers to the preservation of Indigenous knowledge to produce one or more of the following products: Herbs, Herbal Medicines and packaging of Herbal Products.     

In Zambia, while Traditional Medicine is well understood but lacks support, the marketing and selling of locally produced Herbal products can be profitable.  The Herbal Medicine is either gathered from the wild or is grown by local people; typically sold through local markets.  However, Herbalt Medicine sales are able to meet demand if its produced and packaged in a professional manner. The industry is limited by production yield.   

In the last decade, a viable industry has emerged.  Local people have driven the success and the industry continues to attract strong support from the Community for the Well Being of in need of cure.
