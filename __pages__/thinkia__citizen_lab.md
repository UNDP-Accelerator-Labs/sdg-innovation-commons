## Title

Thinkia - citizen lab: strengthening public innovation capacities
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is twofold. On one side, we want to facilitate the articulation between the government and other actors of the innovation system. On the other, we want to strengthen at the local and national level government knowledge and capacities on public innovation. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

History and driver: Three years ago, we started to map the innovation ecosystem in Ecuador to identify what other actors were working on, and how they were doing it. Nevertheless, we did not only want to generate a map of actors, but rather build a set of tools that will allow the so-called “innovation ecosystem” to act, move and behave like one. So, we started having discussions with other actors from the innovation ecosystem to understand how this set of tools should look like. Once we had this going, we decided to take a next step. We presented the work done so far, called Thinkia, to the Under Secretary of Public Administration since they were in charge to implement the first Citizen Innovation Lab at the national level. The creation of this Lab is one of the commitments listed in Ecuador´s Action Plan as a member of Open Government Partnership. Actors involved and current situation: Thinkia: citizen lab is a space that generates an agile dynamic between government and citizens to strengthen citizen confidence in public administration and jointly solve problems that jeopardize social welfare. Thinkia is an initiative of Senescyt and is managed together with a multi-stakeholder core team comprising by UNDP (cooperation), EPICO and the Ombudsman's Office (public sector), the School of Government and Public Administration of the Instituto de High Studies and FLACSO Science, Technology and Society Lab (academia), Datalat and OpenlabEc (civil society).

Public innovation is bursting into the field of administration in a decisive way. The need to provide answers to social demands, to the technological revolution and to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require practical approaches for the complex machinery of public administrations. Conceptually, "innovating in public administrations involves the creation of new ideas or services whose implementation generates a tangible return in the form of public value" (Rojas-Martín, 2018).




The innovations of our time in the technological, environmental and pharmaceutical fields have emerged, have been developed and have been financed thanks to public administrations. This evidence should give the public sector a boost to its self-esteem so that it can continue to invest in innovation, but it should also act as an incentive to look inward within their organizations and generate more dynamic spaces for innovation.




The proliferation of government laboratories for public innovation (GobLabs) in the Ibero-American region is introducing changes in the ways of doing and thinking in public administrations. Latin American region is introducing changes in the ways of doing and thinking in public administrations. There is a growth in the number of projects, initiatives and meetings, and discussions are multiplying to make them known, disseminate their experiences and develop new work methodologies. 




Government laboratories are committed to introducing new experimental approaches to public management. Their job is to surface and properly design new ideas and to conduct trials to test their effectiveness before implementing any improvement solutions. Before allocating public resources to the development of a given public policy, it seems logical to know that it works. The relevance that this phenomenon is acquiring is worth to be supported and promoted.

In this line, Ecuador set up as one of the commitments to achieve in his first Open Government Action Plan to implement a Citizen Innovation Lab, but the actors involved in the implementation of it did not necessarily had a vision, strategy or understood the purpose or mechanisms to do public innovation.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Value proposition: UNDP´s Acc Lab was able to offer technical assistance to the actors responsible to set up the Citizen Innovation Lab at the national level by bringing a long-term vision, a management and operating strategy based on the Public Innovation Hexagon, and most importantly and array of experience and knowledge on participatory and collaborative methods to work with the civil community (know-how). Given the relevance of public innovation processes to strengthen democracy and citizen confidence in public administration, it was fundamental to contribute from the design to the implementation of the Citizen Innovation Lab.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Thinkia is the first citizen lab that Ecuador has at the national level. This lab started as one of the commitments of Ecuador´s Open Government Partnership Agenda and now is officially a national initiative led by the Secretariat of Higher Education and Innovation. Thinkia generates agile dynamics between citizens and government to reduce distances and jointly solve problems that jeopardize social welfare. Thinkia is taking up the role of trainer of trainers with various municipalities regarding public innovation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Whether the combination of various actors co-managing Thinkia: citizen lab is the key to ensure its sustainability in the long-run and accurate operation as a space of co-creation for public good?  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

 

To operate Thinkia: citizen lab so far, we have supported launching five innovation challenges and one co-creation process of public innovation inviting a broad array of citizens and organizations to participate in the generation of testable and scalable solutions. The collaborative and participatory methodologies mainly used have been design thinking, collective intelligence, and user-design center, among others to ensure that user´s voices are heard and that they are active participants in the decision-making process of solution. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Design thinking is used as the main methodology of Thinkia: citizen, this has ensured that co-creation processes and user´s journey become the heart of public innovation. Thinkia is accurately operating as a space to articulate citizens and the government to prototype ideas and jointly solve issues that jeopardize public good.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are in the growing phase, so mission accomplished!
