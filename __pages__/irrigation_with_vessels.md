Description: Millennial system that requires no energy and uses only the water that plants need. In addition, it employs artisans, contributes to food security, is cheap and biodegradable.

Through a system of transpiration, the vessels provide the necessary water to the plants that settle near them. The plants use the water they need and have a reserve at their fingertips, which allows them to reduce water stress in the dry season. 

Interesting feature: It uses millenary technologies that allow to reduce water consumption and have no negative environmental impact.
