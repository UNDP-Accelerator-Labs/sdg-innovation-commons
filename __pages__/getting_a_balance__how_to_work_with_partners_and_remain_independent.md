## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

External partners may change their priorities which affects the implementation of the project. It is vital to keep the balance between connecting with interested and supportive government partners and performing work independently so that you are not completely dependent on your partner's decisions.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The main barrier was that the challenge was linked directly to the activities of the Ministry, which decided to postpone the project. It was not possible to carry out the project independently, so we had to put it on hold for an indefinite period and move on to other projects.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To sense and explore the issue of budget distribution to mass sport our team used open data and results of the interviews and observations to identify existing gaps. The main problem was that the process of budget distribution was not transparent to all participants which caused a risk of corruption. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

A prototype of the scoring system has been developed using AI/ML technology to automatically distribute the budget to mass sports facilities using available data.
