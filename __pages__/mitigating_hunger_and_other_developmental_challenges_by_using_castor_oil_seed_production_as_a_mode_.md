> Title of the innovation

Mitigating hunger and other developmental challenges by using castor oil seed production as a model on Zambia's Rural Areas

> Brief description of the innovation

Many communities world wide including Zambia have challenges which are associated with developmental issues such as lack of Education, Clean Water, Sanitation and Zero Hunger Tolerance. Will attempt to highlight how growing of castor oil plants by rural Zambian farmers can help them fight hunger by adopting relevant technologies.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income for me and others by selling castor oil seeds to the pharmatical manufacturers thus eliminating hunger and poverty. will manufacture medicines that will help in skin and hair care in addition to easing constipation. People to be assisted in the above arrangement will be mostly from chemists and drug stores. The operations of the above existing business will improve because they will receive more money by providing services that involves skin care, hair care, as well as eye care since castor oil eye ointment can heal floaters for those who have them in their eyes.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to assist small scale farmers who live mainly in rural areas and may not need capital. small pieces of land which may be less than a hector can be used as a start. agricultural extension officers may be required in helping the farmers to spray their crops. castor oil does not require fertilizers. there is generally no prototype   of innovation which is available at the moment as castor oil can be produced manually by extracting oil placed in boiling water using BIRD Feathers.
in the first year year the proposed implementation plan will include the production of castor oil seeds on one hector of land which are to be sold to the pharmaceuticals directly for cash in readiness for business expansion. more land for production will be increased in year two while in the third year oil processing machines can be bought using either capital from my own resources or from a bank sourced loan. this is not a priority. To enable the innovation to have access to more funds a poultry business for keeping chickens can be added to the existing business since stock feed is available from processed seeds. 
The above measure will create room for more expansion business.

> Anticipated Social Impact

(i) For those who will be involved in the castor oil seed production it has available cash from the Pharmaceutical industries
(ii) Poverty reduction will also be another added advantage to those who will be involved in the schedule.
(iii) Safe health foods will be available to citizens from the farmers who buy organic manure from castor oil producers.
(iv) Local stock feeds: can also be easily available to poultry and animal farmers.
(v) people suffering from eye floaters will be helped by using castor oil eye ointments
(vi) People with hair and skin issues will be helped by using castor oil products.
