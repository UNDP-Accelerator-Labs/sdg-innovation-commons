## Overall goal

Collaboratively characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of extreme weather phenomena and their social and economic effects in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and Paraguay. 
## Specific goals

Create a database for the validation and calibration of operational diagnostic and forecasting systems aimed at the early detection of potential weather events with high social impact.  

Develop tools the community can use for the prevention of weather events with high social impact to increase their level of awareness about these events and improve their response capacity. 
## Description of citizen participation

Primary and secondary school students and the general public, weather enthusiasts, contribute by observing and reporting extreme weather phenomena through various platforms (social media, groups, forums, web interface, among others). The initiative plans to develop a chatbot to help communities submit continuous reports through their mobile phones.
