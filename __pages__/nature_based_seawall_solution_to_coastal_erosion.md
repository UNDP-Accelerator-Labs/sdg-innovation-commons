300 villagers and 1 school will be benefit from the construction of a 450-meter nature-based ‘hybrid’ seawall built with bouldering work, land reclamation, and rows of mangroves and vetiver planting. The seawall will not only protect the coastline and village but will promote marine biodiversity by creating a home for many marine species. In 2020, a similar nature-based seawall was successfully implemented in Macuata, Vanualevu, Fiji using mangroves, boulders, and vetiver grass. However, more time is needed to assess the level of success these nature-based seawalls will provide in the long term.
