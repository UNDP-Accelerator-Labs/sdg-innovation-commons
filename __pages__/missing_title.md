Strengthening Libya’s Preparedness: Launching a National Emergency Alerting System (NEAS)


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)







Our challenge is the lack of a functional national early warning system in Libya. The
devastating floods in Derna and other natural disasters have revealed critical
gaps in preparedness and response coordination. We aim to address this by
implementing a National Emergency Alerting System (NEAS) using cell broadcast
technology. This system will enable targeted, rapid, and reliable dissemination
of alerts to mitigate risks, protect lives, and enhance national disaster
preparedness.





> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?







Libya lacks an integrated early warning mechanism. Disasters, including recent floods, have
demonstrated the consequences of this gap: delayed evacuations, higher fatalities, and uncoordinated responses. The NEAS initiative builds on lessons from neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia and Oman, leveraging cell broadcast technology for geographically targeted alerts. This privacy-conscious approach requires no pre-registration, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility.

Key stakeholders include:

National Meteorological Center (NMC): Responsible for issuing alerts.

Libya Holding Company for Tele-Communications: Facilitates broadcasting alerts via telecom networks.

UNDP Accelerator Lab: Provides technical guidance, stakeholder
coordination, and advocacy.

Without NEAS, Libya remains vulnerable to future disasters, with significant socio-economic
and human costs.





> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 





According to the GSMA Cell Broadcast Report (2023), cell broadcast has proven to deliver alerts within seconds, reaching millions efficiently.

Post-flood assessments highlight a lack of timely communication, contributing to over 11,000 deaths in Derna (OCHA Libya,
2023).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?







The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Libya is uniquely positioned to lead this initiative due to its expertise in innovation, collective intelligence, and partnerships. By integrating global best practices with local knowledge, we can prototype and scale the NEAS effectively.

Technical Expertise: Guiding the integration of cell broadcast technology with existing telecom infrastructure.

Stakeholder Engagement: Building consensus among government, private sector, and civil society.

Capacity Building: Organizing workshops to ensure seamless implementation and public awareness.

Building on Libya's lessons post recent crises and in response to recent discussions held during the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) workshop at the Ministry of Local Governance - National Emergency Committee, The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Libya proposes the National Emergency Alerting Service (NEAS), a solution designed to utilize Cell Broadcast technology. Notably, Cell Broadcast capabilities are already supported by Libya’s cellular networks, making it a highly feasible and compatible option for immediate implementation. This technology will provide geographically targeted alerts across the country, enhancing Libya’s disaster preparedness and aligning with recommendations from recent DRR-focused discussions.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Consultancy and Stakeholder Engagement:
We will conduct structured consultations with government agencies, telecommunication providers, and emergency management stakeholders. These consultations will identify operational gaps, build consensus, and facilitate co-creation of actionable strategies. By leveraging diverse expertise, this method ensures that the NEAS is contextually appropriate and aligned with national priorities.

Digital Transformation Workshops:

Organized capacity-building sessions will focus on the technical and operational aspects of implementing cell broadcast technology. These workshops will equip stakeholders with the skills and knowledge required to adopt and manage the technology effectively.

Prototyping and Pilot Testing:
A pilot project will be launched to test the NEAS in a specific region. This iterative prototyping approach will allow for real-world testing of technology, uncovering potential challenges, and fine-tuning the system for broader implementation.

Awareness Campaigns:
We will design and execute public awareness initiatives to educate communities about the NEAS, emphasizing its benefits and building trust. Campaigns will utilize social media, community forums, and traditional media to maximize reach and engagement.
