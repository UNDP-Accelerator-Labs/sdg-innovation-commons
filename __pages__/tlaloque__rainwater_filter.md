Tlaloque, the first Mexican product of its kind, separates the dirtiest part of each rain so that it does not enter the cistern. The Tlaloque allows you to connect surfaces of up to 200 m2, for rural areas and 100m2 for urban areas, it also allows you to choose how many liters of rain you are going to separate.
