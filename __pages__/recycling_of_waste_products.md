The innovation is focused on recycling waste paper into paper egg trays and to repurpose waste plastic into bricks. Reducing the amount of paper and plastic being thrown away would improve the aesthetic beauty of the town and transform the land being used as open landfill into a garden or for other productive uses. The model is designed to re-purpose waste paper and plastic into valuable goods that would ensure they remain sustainable
