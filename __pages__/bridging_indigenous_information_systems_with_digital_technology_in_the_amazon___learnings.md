## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Our challenge was to understand whether and under what conditions improved access to information and knowledge facilitated by ICTs can enhance the capabilities of indigenous peoples in the Amazon to better achieve adaptation, forest preservation, and sustainable livelihoods.

We began with an understanding of main interests of indigenous people in de amazon in order stablish an political,  cultural and social context for our challenge.

The main insights are:

1.     A significant body of work produced between the 18th and 20th centuries documents the social organization, language, politics, economy, rituals, interethnic relations, and other cultural aspects of Indigenous peoples in the Amazon, providing valuable insights into their characteristics. However, much of this literature has remained largely unchanged over time, reinforcing a static perspective on Indigenous peoples, their social structures, economic activities, relationships with nature, and interactions with ICT technologies.

2.    Historically, protest marchs are the most effective mechanism for indigenous people in the amazon, to address demands or conflicts between indiegenous peoples and the civil society with the government as a bridge to establish agreements and policies for indigenous peoples. In this process, basic ICT tools like text messages or WhatsApp have played a vital role in coordination and communication.         

3. The Amazon's biodiversity in flora and fauna, its agricultural, livestock, timber, and mining potential, along with increased migratory flows from the Andes and within the region, have intensified pressure on natural resource use. This has often resulted in conflicts and competition for control among white-mestizo populations, Indigenous groups from other areas, and the state, each holding differing visions and interests regarding resource protection, conservation, and sustainable use.This reconfiguration of populations and economic activities is a key factor driving the contemporary transformations of Indigenous peoples. They have become increasingly integrated into a capitalist, extractivist economy while also participating in national and regional movements to defend the Amazon. However, ICT technologies have not yet played a significant role in addressing these emerging challenges.

4.     The major issues on the agenda of Indigenous peoples, as partly expressed in the successive marches organized by their groups, include, in order of prioritization: i) territorial rights and local perspectives on land and territory, ii) Indigenous autonomy and self-management, iii) political participation, iv) sustainable development, v) cultural identity, vi) education, particularly intercultural and bilingual education, vii) health, and viii) climate change. To be truly effective and useful, the use of ICT must focus on facilitating the resolution of these key issues.

Building on these insights, some of the conditions for Indigenous peoples in the Amazon to take advantage of ICTs are closely linked to their prioritized demands, particularly local perspectives on land and territory, as well as Indigenous autonomy and self-management. Additionally, contemporary transformations resulting from the reconfiguration of populations and economic activities present a significant opportunity to integrate ICTs for access to information and knowledge about current challenges. Lastly, the conservation of cultural identity offers a great opportunity to incorporate ICTs and expand their use in daily and strategic activities.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

As the next steps, we will cross-reference all this information with geographical maps, NGO intervention maps, and other relevant maps to generate insights for the implementation of the GEF project in the Amazon. This project, which is currently a top priority for the government, is set to begin next year

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose these types of data because there were information gaps to address the specific challenge we aimed to tackle.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Systems thinking and sensemaking were crucial in establishing the political, cultural, and social context necessary to understand how ICT connects with Indigenous peoples' demands. Micro-narratives complemented the general information, enabling access to specific details about use cases and providing deeper insights into their relevance and impact.

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The insights could not have been developed so quickly without using innovative methods and collaborating with unconventional partners. These resources were crucial in reframing the challenge from a more holistic perspective.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
