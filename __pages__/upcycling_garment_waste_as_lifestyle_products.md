## The Challenge

With 5.5 lac tonnes of garments waste every year, pollution is a huge problem in Bangladesh. 
## The Solution

To address the challenge, Baah, a digital-first sustainable living brand with in-house designs, created a solution to upcycle local wastages and make lifestyle goods with unused cotton and denim. It employs an informal workforce like ex-garments workers for making these products. It says it has over 5000+ units sold using such goods. Baah is one of the first upcycle ecommerce brands in Bangladesh. It pays special attention to women empowerment.

Baah aims to help address pollution challenges via circularity while also creating employment for women artisans through informality.
