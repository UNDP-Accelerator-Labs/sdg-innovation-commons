Ghasham is a Saudi inventor and science researcher. In 2017, he moved to Riyadh to study to become an Aircraft Technical Engineer. After moving to Riyadh, he noticed the number of coffee grounds being wasted in the cafes. This triggered him and was the drive for him to do something as his hometown of Rawdhat Sudair which is considered a farming community. From this stemmed Ghasham’s solution “Start Recycling” to recycle coffee grounds into fertilizers. He had started with one café in his hometown where he placed a shelf that customers who come to purchase coffee could also leave with a free fertilizer for their farm. His initiative grew covering 80% of his hometown cafes in the Sudair Region. Following the success in AlMajma’ah, Ghasham had aimed to expand to Riyadh. The need for the end-product in a city like Riyadh was low whereas a farming town had a need for fertilizers. This got Ghasham thinking of creating and testing an alternative product: Body scrubs and perfumes from coffee grounds which are coming soon. Ghasham is currently working on creating a Trading Plan in order to sustain his initiative. This includes thinking of ways to have his solution feed into the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative. Ghasham has been able to successfully partner with Cross Coffee in Riyadh (King Abdullah Road). He hopes to continue to form successful partnerships across the city of Riyadh.  Ghasham’s initiative started from a social responsibility rather than a business motive. He had transferred the knowledge he had around recycling to the coffee shops to promote sustainability by giving them the know-how. Ghasham is also promoting women empowerment by collaborating with female farmers to produce body scrubs.  To Ghasham’s knowledge, Saudi Arabia is considered one of the largest importers of coffee. Coffee shops are considered nowadays as a lifestyle in the Saudi community being a social hub rather than merely a means for coffee. Ghasham capitalized on this as an easy way to target and impact society .
