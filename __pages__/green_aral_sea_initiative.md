## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Our learning was to address the consequences of the Aral Sea tragedy that left once the fourth largest inland lake in the world as a desert. The initiative was designed as a set of interlinked interventions: 1) to test crowdfunding for afforestation at the dry seabed to mitigate environmental consequences, creating a precedent for similar alt. financing initiatives by UNDP and partners 2) to try out innovative approaches for planting trees in the toxic soils using hydrogel technology and 3) to use the platform as an awareness-raising tool to inform of the Aral Sea disaster’s impacts both within Uzbekistan and around the world

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis #1: IF we provide an opportunity to the community, private sector, and others to partner and beneficially engage around the Aral Sea challenges, THEN they will actively participate in finding solutions and contribute to addressing the challenges. Hypothesis #2: IF people are offered an accountable crowdfunding platform to address development challenges, THEN they WILL contribute financially. THUS, crowdfunding could be used to address other development challenges. Hypothesis # 3: IF people will learn more about the needs of people in the Aral Sea Region through human-centered stories, THEN participants WILL have a sense of affiliation and ownership. THUS, people will be willing to support such projects.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1) Set up a crowdfunding platform run by UNDP CO to enable to take an action 2) Engage and formalize Partnerships with Private Sector and Government Institutions to provide ownership of the initiative 3) Reach out to the local and international audiences with clear messages about the challenge and our solution

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

number of $ raised; the area of hectares planted; number of partnerships established, number of reactions on the social media

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

1) Entographic data via interviews, 2) funds collected are reported on the website real time, 3) contractual data on the area planted 4) number of likes on the social media. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

12 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
