UNDP is collaborating with a consortium of eight partners, led by the Wits University School of Governance, to evaluate the impact of the government’s expanded social protection package in response to Covid-19. This
research will analyse the impact of the grants for individuals, households, and communities which will surface important learnings to inform future programming and decision-making. The evaluation will be capturing insights regarding opportunities for transformative policy reform, feelings of empowerment, income seeking behaviours, access to food, social cohesion, and shifts in gender relations among many other areas. The project will make use of a variety of methodologies, including new and innovative data collection techniques such as drawing on voice notes submitted by youth via whatsapp.
