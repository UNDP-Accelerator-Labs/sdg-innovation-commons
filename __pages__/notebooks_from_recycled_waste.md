Felek is a notebook brand under Savannah Printing Press Plc, which started recycling after witnessing the increased amount of wasted paper from its printing press. 
"We use a historical Coptic stitching method to produce hand-made paper," said Sulieman Dawit, managing and creative director of the company. "We use customizable leather or recycled jerrycans to produce covers for the notebooks."
After launching Felek Notebooks & Journal in 2016, the company found it challenging to penetrate the market because of a prejudicial view that questioned the quality standards and assumed that recycled products are more expensive, according to the director.
"The prices of the recycled commodities have to compete with their virgin counterparts made straight out of the wood pulp," Suleiman said.
