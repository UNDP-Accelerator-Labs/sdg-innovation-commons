## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Finding the way to  lift up and scale local biomimicry solutions (even if they do not know that they are biomimic). Can this be a participation in the Global Design Challenge? 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

2020: There are number of local grassroots solutions that by nature use biomimicry, and we just need to identify them and help them shine. Furthermore, the best option to identify them would be a localized version of the Biomimicry Global Design Challenge.

2021: Design Challenge is not enough! We need to create a fertile soil first: platform for people to meet and socialize on the topic of the biomimicry and seeds: local partners that would help to find potential biomimicry inventors.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

2020 - Run a Localized Version of the Global Challenged
2021 - Create the fertile soil (platform to learn and exchange) and find the seeds (potential entrepreneurs scouting)

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Biomimicry Entrepreneurs/Innovators 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Number of applications, applicants interviews, participants interviews 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 month in 2020 and 4 month in 2021

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

10 UNV voluntears 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

2020:  NO. organizing a challenge for something that few people are familiar with was not the right approach
2021: Yes, support ecosystem creation (platform with education, mentoring, meeting place, incubation and acceleration) + potential entrepreneur scouting with a help of local partners) indeed bring fantastic results. Ukrainian team WON the International Challenge this year.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Piloting and testing - learning by doing

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

4 month

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

10K

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We were planning to have a bigger Biomimicry/Circular Economy Enterprenourship Development Programm - but it is stopped because of the war

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We were planning to have a bigger Biomimicry/Circular Economy Enterprenourship Development Programm - but it is stopped because of the war

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

- Yes, it is possible to find potential biomimicry innovators from grassroots in Ukraine 
- But they need a safe space and tools and support to develop into real biomimicry innovations relevant in the Global Scale

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

2020:  Organizing a challenge for something that few people are familiar with was not the right approach
2021: Support ecosystem creation (platform with education, mentoring, meeting place, incubation and acceleration) + potential entrepreneur scouting with a help of local partners) indeed bring fantastic results. Ukrainian team WON the International Challenge this year.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Difficult to fit this into UNDP usual programming 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Environmental and Business Related Department

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministry of Environmental protection and Regional Development, Different Business Investors, 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, 2020 and 2021 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Spend lots of time for creation a fertile social (localized platform with education, mentoring, meeting place, incubation and acceleration) + potential entrepreneur scouting (with a help of local partners)

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sensing and exploring brought us to the importance of the topic of biomimicry in general. Mapping local solutions in the Ukraine made us think that there are number of potential biomimicry entrepreneurs who just need an extra push.

> What surprised you?

Solution from Ukraine can actually WIN international Challenge with the right support from UNDP
