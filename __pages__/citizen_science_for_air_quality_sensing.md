## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Citizen Science for Air Quality Sensing
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the current air quality sensors used by the government are at least 15 times more expensive than the ones we are introducing and citizens have no role to play around air quality issue that tremendously affect their health.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The single greatest environmental risk for health, climate and sustainable development is air pollution. Outdoor (ambient) and household (indoor) air pollution are responsible for about 7 million premature deaths annually – making air pollution one of the largest single causes of premature mortality and morbidity worldwide. Continued industrialization, urbanization and increasing socio-economic changes within Cambodia, provides a critical opportunity to reprioritize air pollution as a central component of public wellbeing and socio-economic progress.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Our survey in 2020 with 563 citizens living in Phnom Penh revealed that almost 4 out of 5 citizens believe that air pollution is now a major issue in the capital city. While air pollution is believed to be harmful and came from multiple sources ranging from fuel burning from vehicle to industry, construction dusts and open trash burning.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There is an opportunity to use unified low-cost and innovative sensors that are able to and provide real-time information to monitor air pollution in Phnom Penh. Having citizen centered around social issues, generation of knowledge/data collection at least shed light on them, advance social interests, and/or promote citizen action/education.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The current air quality sensors used by Cambodian government are at least 15 times more expensive than the ones we are introducing and citizens have no role to play around air quality issue that tremendously affect their health.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

To what extent the results/data from mobile sensors are accurate compared to government stationary sensors so that they will consider to deploy the innovative sensors across the country.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Mobile sensors are much cheaper compared to the fixed ones. They can be scaled in more locations.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Providing real-time data across locations and citizens can fully engage in monitoring the air quality as well as being part of the solution.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Ministry of Environment and Institute of Technology of Cambodia are key collaborators in growing this challenge.
