## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) The lack of dialogue and communication and diverse perspectives between different areas in the organizations makes systemic thinking and strategic innovation very difficult. In general, the approach by sectorial public policies is what predominates mainly due to a traditional and rigid bureaucratic organizational culture.

2) A systemic approach and implementing innovative processes imply transcending institutional limits and interests, generating conviction in the complex challenges that encourage aligning responses, actions, and work towards the same objective. It proposes new scenarios for effective governance, hybrid perspectives overcoming the traditional concept of "dichotomy governance" such as " the state and the market”.

3) Convinced leadership is of upmost importance to implement innovation and to influence decision-making.

4) Our CO is seen from its skills and abilities to tackle complex challenges rather than from the topics it addresses. Progress is being made at the CO to build a transition:

o   From the description of the problems to the understanding of the dynamics and systems

o   From specific to comprehensive technical assistance (although they are not mutually exclusive)

o   From static gaze to changing perspectives

o   From linearity to complexity

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One barrier that we experienced is the lack of comprehensive consensus-building, which is challenging particularly when it requires bringing together individuals from different sectors and sometimes with opposing ideologies and priorities. Another barrier has been timing; embedding strategic innovation at the core of governance takes time and we must protect the process. Furthermore, fear, or the government's doubts to embark on innovation processes, where usually there are no answers, or there is not a linear and clear planning of what will be the result in each stage. Lastly, a big barrier could be the continuity, maintenance and/or replicability of these processes.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To measure the motivation of public employees, we needed to gather information about their characteristics (job seniority, gender, position, salary training completed, and workplace, among others). All this data was provided from the human management area. Furthermore, surveys were held to gather data regarding their motivation level. All this data was processed with researchers from Warwick University.

Regarding the deep demo process, through interviews, collective intelligence sessions, interviews, and focus groups we were able to bring together various actors to understand the dynamics around the complex challenges and how the activation of various prototypes move the entire waste management system. In turn, through all these data gatherings, we were able to design a portfolio of interconnected solutions that respond to the various narratives. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- Sensemaking: we developed sensemaking exercises with subnational governments to connect current initiatives with topics and new prototypes through a system thinking approach. 

- Deep listening: this process allowed us to unravel a community’s narratives, and reveal in-depth needs, challenges, and opportunities. We used this approach not only to collect data and conduct analysis to generate results, but also to contribute to change through the process of applying the methods. Together with ethnography methods, we created “the perfil personas” that allowed us to understand the metanarratives and build prototypes answering to different needs.

- We used a portfolio approach because isolated project-based approaches can hardly operate at the scale and multi-dimensional level required by complex problems that ask for systemic change. Therefore, projects need to be integrated and conceptualized as an interconnected portfolio. As in co-creation and prototyping practices, this novel portfolio approach also requires new capabilities to design, manage and evaluate the interconnected and integrated set of projects with a holistic vision.

- Randomized Control Trials: we carried on an RCT with the support of Warwick University, to measure how an open innovation contest influence on people's motivation to work.  150 employees were invited to participate in the innovation contest (treatment group) and 150 were not (control group). The 300 were evaluated to identify if the innovation contest had any effect on the motivation of the civil service.

 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with several NGOs that work with the waste issue to understand the complexity of the challenge. Furthermore, we worked with cooperatives that work with waste pickers to design together certain prototypes. Lastly, we generated collective intelligence sessions with NGOs that work with health issues around the waste problem, with education centers that work with young people and with NGOs that work with food waste. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

- Warwick University – We work with them in the design and implementation of the experiment to impact in the motivation and productivity of public employees in the Municipality of Canelones and in INAU (National institution of children and youth in Uruguay)

- Universities in Uruguay - Partnership with academics in Uruguay was mainly made through individuals, experts working on the relevant knowledge field of the process. They exposed and engaged in collective intelligence sessions. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Companies that were part of the listening process. When working on a complex issue like waste management with the Municipality of Montevideo, listening to the private sector it is of utmost importance. That is why we carry out interviews and collective interpretation sessions with companies that are dedicated to waste and with business chambers.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The departmental governments are our key partners.

- We mainly work with the Municipality of Montevideo in a strategic innovation process with the Deep Demo process where we address the complex challenge of garbage.

- With the Municipality of Canelones, we are working in three processes: 1- we are addressing the complex challenge around gastronomy as a vector of social transformation; 2- we are working on the development of an innovation lab; 3- we have implemented an Innovation contest that helped to improve the motivation of employees who work directly with the public.

- With the Municipality of Treinta y Tres, we are working on the development of an Innovation Lab.

Furthermore, we also work with the national government implementing innovation processes. For example, with the INAU (National institution of children and youth in Uruguay), we are working in the development of an innovation contest to improve the motivation of the public employees. 

The ANII (National Agency for Investigation & Innovation), is our partner to develop the innovation contest both in Canelones and INAU. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

None of the partners were strictly new to UNDP but for sure it was a new way of working. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNICEF. As we are working with the National institution of children and youth in Uruguay, we involved UNICEF in the design of this experiment. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
