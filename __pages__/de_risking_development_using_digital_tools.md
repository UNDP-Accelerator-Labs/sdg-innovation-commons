## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



De-risking development using digital tools (opening challenge for 2024)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the potential of digital tools to de-risk financial investments in the environment and small enterprises and CSOs remains largely unrealized in Trinidad and Tobago despite a high level of digital and mobile penetration.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Since 2022, the government has taken serious interest in digitizing both economy and society and it has received financial support from various development partners, including the IADB, CAF and UNCDF. There is a significant thrust towards digital finance and many commercial banking institutions have launched mobile payment systems for smaller businesses. Despite this, certain key segments of the society remain woefully under included. Many of these are socially- and environmentally-oriented organisations who, in a more developed society, align to ESG principals and, it is hypothesised, would receive greater support. Besides the fact that the benefit of these activities is not fully understood in Trinidad and Tobago (as evidenced by interviews and workshops held over the last year with the EU delegation and prominent NGOs), there exists the view that their activities are somewhat risky compared to more traditional for-profit activities. Given the recent thrust towards digital finance and real-time data to de-risk investments, the UNDP Accelerator Lab is embarking on a challenge to improve the inclusion of such organisations over the course of the year focusing on the blue-green economy, and financial education to improve investment and invest-ability and the digitisation of social benefits platforms.

There was a "Digital Financial Inclusion Survey" done by the UNCDF which will be used to support this; however, this report is not yet available to publish. Other evidence is anecdotal.

Funding for previous projects linked to the Green Economy Coalition indicate that this need is acute for the environmental sector. See link here: https://canari.org/lgesfinance/ 
The broader focus with reference to small enterprises and the wide public is captured in the UNCDF report. See link here: https://www.uncdf.org/article/8236/trinidad-and-tobagos-digital-finance-odyssey-charting-the-course-to-a-cashless-society.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab is able to produce small working prototypes quickly and efficiently through partnerships with the public, private citizens and CSOs/NGOs. This has been proven during our numerous challenges (Green Innovation, Tobago Innovation, Plastic Innovation, Sargassum Innovation and Peace Innovation Challenges). This level of dexterity is admired by partners and puts us in a unique place to provide value quickly. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



💚 Harnessing the power of digital tools to reduce investment risks, we're actively engaging the private sector to invest in development initiatives. Let's build a sustainable future! 🌱💼 #UNDP #Environment #InvestInGreen #TrinidadAndTobago

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can digital tools create an environment where owners of capital are more comfortable investing in projects with strong, transparent environmental and social outcomes? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will approach several collectives of software developers and bring them into contact with specialists in target areas (1. the environment and blue carbon, (2) financial educators such as the National Financial Literacy Programme (NFLP) out of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago) and (3) investors to collective understand one another to develop prototypes of software that can generate the data that support investor comfort with the investment and metrics for reporting on goals and achievements. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We have no data in Trinidad and Tobago on the role of digital finance and tools for creating a more transparent environment for investment, especially in the context of burgeoning interest in ESG-aligned initiatives. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Once successful, the UNCDF will provide further funding for the projects and similar ones. The reach of the UNCDF is regional within CARICOM, and, as such, there is strong potential for uptake of projects by regional governments.
