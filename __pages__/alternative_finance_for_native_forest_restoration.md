## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Crowdfunding in Uruguay can be an effective alternative finance mechanism for development challenges.  Through crowdfunding, it is possible to achieve greater awareness of specific issues (for example, the importance of ecosystem restoration), both nationally and globally.    If the proposal is solid and clear, companies show interest in supporting actions backed by UNDP for green recovery.    It is possible to convene the different areas of the country office around a specific challenge with a clear goal to which everyone can contribute. Working directly with local communities has positive effects and results, but it demands more time and effort and needs continuous risks management that must be considered beforehand.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One of the initial barriers that we had to overcome was the identification of the UNDP with the management of funds. In addition, there were government organizations involved in our project, so some people questioned why the UNDP or the government was not directly financing this initiative.   Some non-institutionalized local groups did not understand the logic of UNDP operations, or project management issues, which generated tensions between the parties.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To achieve the highest performance in crowdfunding, it was necessary to continuously monitor their results by managing the data provided by the Classy platform, visits to our website and videos, the origin of transactions, and surveys of donors. We also test the effectiveness of different messages and ads on Google (google ad sense), Facebook, and Instagram. In this way, data management can contribute to decision-making for a more significant impact in raising awareness and fund raising.   Regarding the restoration of the native forest, the community was involved in citizen monitoring.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

On the one hand, developing the first crowdfunding campaign for sustainable development in Uruguay allowed us to demonstrate that it is possible to promote alternative finance for development with the contribution of people and companies. This initiative also involved a crowdsourcing process where each organization brought different sources of information, knowledges, experiences, recommendations, and views on the restoration of the native forest with community management.   The entire process from the beginning was built collectively, promoting decision-making spaces in conjunction with government organizations (national and sub-national), civil society, the local community, and UNDP. In addition, we foster a participatory process at the local level where definitions had to be taken in the community, reaching consensus on the type of restoration, which native trees to prioritize, and which preservation and monitoring system to implement.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Environmental NGOs Network. This Network was one of the key partners for the initiative, they bring together the civil society organizations that participate in the process at the local level. They were the counterpart organization in the responsible party agreement that included the objectives and activities for implementing the native forest restoration actions.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Universities helped us to disseminate the crowdfunding campaign.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

60% of the funds raised from crowdfunding was thanks to the support of five private companies. Beyond this, we had in-kind collaboration from other companies that supported the campaign's dissemination and the voluntary support of one digital marketing expert and two influencers.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

National Government: Ministry of Environment & Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. The defense of the native forest is aligned with the public policies and strategies of the State, carried out by the three ministries, among which the National Environmental Plan, the National Biodiversity Strategy, the National Climate Change Policy, the National Strategy for Native Forest and the Ecosystem Restoration Plan. We involved them in the crowdfunding and crowdsourcing process as institutional allies. The General Forestry Directorate of the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries and the Biodiversity and Ecosystemic Services Directorate of the Ministry of Environment provided technical assistance on the native forest. They had expert knowledge on which are the native species to plant in each place. The CO has worked with the ministries previously, as they are part of the Plantaton initiative. Sub-national government: the state government supported the project, provided the machinery needed, and allowed the intervention in a public area. The local government also supported operations and through human resources.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Involving a digital marketing specialist and two influencers in the process was something new for the office, valuing new perspectives and contributions to development challenges. On the other hand, the office had as a precedent an important agreement with one private company. Still, agile mechanisms had not been developed for greater involvement and participation of the private sector in development challenges. Finally, it was the first time that a Bank offered through its credit and debit card rewards system the possibility of exchanging points for donations to UNDP, something with great potential.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We generated an alliance with the International Organization for Migration (IOM). They were interested in mapping the Uruguayan diaspora, and they saw the crowdfunding campaign as an opportunity to identify Uruguayans who live abroad that want to contribute with an environmental cause in Uruguay. They helped communicating in their social media and contacts all the campaign.
