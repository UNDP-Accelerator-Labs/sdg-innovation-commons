> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation involves the value addition through the processing of an existing wild fruit that has been identified in the community. It is consumed by children and adults and is usually collected by women and children, sold by roadsides and markets although at a very low cost. It has potential for development into various products with the potential for a higher cost. It also has minimal production costs involved.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We have since re-branded and expanded into cultivation and processing to allow us the opportunity for researching medicinal herbs with nutraceutical potential and health benefits to add value to the market.
Income will be generated from product sales through online and offline distribution channels. Human resources, including operational management, will be remunerated. 
The business operations will be improved through continuous capacity-building efforts to sustain operations through compliance with operational standards, inventory management, record keeping, financial analysis, establishing operational policies, waste management, among others.
The challenge prize will help the business procure additional equipment to increase production and efficiency in operations,and attract collaboration and creation of partnerships.
 The innovation is targeted at health-conscious and health-seeking individuals, including the food and beverage industry.
The value will be added to the environment in the following ways;
1. There will be minimal waste material as the fruit components have various potentials, I.e.the seeds and pulp. While the fruit casings and plant cutting can be formed into compost material to provide nutrition and texture to the soil.
2. The forests and wildlife will be preserved as the cultivation will discourage the destruction of forests and provide food for forest habitats.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to involve and collaborate with various stakeholders such as production managers, product owners, business analysts, developers, marketing experts, researchers,  designers, agronomists, among others.
The prototype is a wild fruit consumed by communities. These are usually collected by women and children, and sold by roadsides and markets for a very low cost. The prototype has potential for development into various products such as a spice, herbal beverage, nutritional supplement, refreshment, among others.
The proposed implementation plan involves the commercialization of the prototype through:
Patency registration of intellectual property at PACRA.
Application for the Certificate of Local Supply Scheme provided by the Zambia Bureau of Standards, to facilitate the processing of quality products.
Seek collaboration and financial support to effectively develop the products while constructing the company infrastructure by utilizing available local resources such as timber, use of burnt bricks, digging a well, as examples.
Rent a commercial kitchen to facilitate processing Purchase of the wild fruit from the local traders to facilitate processing and    further development of the proposed products
Agronomist support for land preparation and propagating the seeds for pilot cultivation
Product sampling and testing
Commercialization

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will help improve livelihoods by solving problems arising from:
1.Poverty, by creating employment for the youth and women in the rural community.
2.Inequality, by working towards achieving and sustaining income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average (IFAD, 2018).
3.Hunger and diet risks, by providing alternatives for achieving good health and well being (Lachat et al., 2018) .
4.Gender inequality, by empowering women through skills training and equal employment opportunities. When women are empowered, families, communities and countries benefit ( FAO,IFAD and WFP, 2020).

The proposed innovation is relevant to the current market through the provision of alternatives for achieving good health and well being. This is achieved through the value addition of existing food consumption through processing and packaging. The increase in demand for the products will be sustained through cultivation. This will also help to preserve the natural resources from destruction.
