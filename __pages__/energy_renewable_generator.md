> Title of the innovation

Energy renewable Generator

> Brief description of the innovation

This generator uses the flywheel to store energy in the form of inertia. In this system we apply extra energy source to start the main motor, a main motor is used to drive a shaft, flywheel and a generator.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Each segment of modern society is dependent on power, from domestic, agriculture and industrial to service and government operations ,all require electricity and energy to function without which the country regardless of a specific sector would come to a standstill. This generator will generate power without the use of fossil fuel and it also noise free.
The plan is to initially procure equipment and set a workshop from which manufacturing of the product will done, this will create jobs for professionals in this regard. 
Innovation in renewable energy technology can generate significant ,quantifiable public benefits that are not reflected in the market price of energy. These benefits include cleaner air and improved public health.

> Technical Feasibility

The design consist of various parts such as, flanges ,flywheel, shaft, motor generator, bearings, belts, dynamo and a starting power unit

> Anticipated Social Impact

Access to reliable and affordable energy is an essential input to economic growth. Agriculture, manufacturing, shops ,construction including SMEs are engines of economic growth and all require energy such as electricity to function efficiently. Electricity is also an essential building block for fighting poverty and promoting sustainable development
