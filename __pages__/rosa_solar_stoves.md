Over reliance on electric powered stoves; and fire wood and charcoal from the trees. The three common sources of energy have a negative impact on the environment.

The Innovation is a Fresnel-style Solar Stove in which a lens focuses concentrated sunlight onto a mirror, the mirror reflects the beam of solar energy onto a cooking area where heat is used for cooking. The innovation is a renewable and environmentally friendly source of energy that once implemented will contribute significantly to reducing the demand on charcoal and also provide an alternative energy source for household cooking. It can contribute to reduced electricity consumption and mitigate negative impact on climate.
