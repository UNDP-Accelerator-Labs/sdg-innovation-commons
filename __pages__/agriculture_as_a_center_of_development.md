> Title of the innovation

Agriculture as a center of development

> Brief description of the innovation

For every country to see development be it in the education sector, health sector or economic development,  agriculture stands out to be an important part to achieve all that. For a country like Zambia, for it to grow in all these sectors agriculture must be put first. My proposal is that our country Zambia should have government owned areas in each province specifically meant to grow different agriculture products through out the year. These areas should be fully equipped with different agriculture equipment and schools where different diplomats can use to improve the way of farming. The reason is we cannot have quality education if pupils are not have adequate food, be it economic growth cannot be said to be attained if people are living in poverty and as such there health will be compromised as we.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If government is to spare land were to do agriculture it will mean that their will be need for people to look after the field, in short  short it will create employment, it will improve the standards of living of people, it will also zero hunger because almost every agriculture products will be produced locally and it also attract foreign exchange and improve the health standards of people.

> Technical Feasibility

My proposal is to be implemented as follows; the first and foremost is that the government should spare at least 2000 hectares in each province and then choose representatives to look after and run the operations in each province and also the government to buy improved machinery to use during the farming.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It  will create jobs for local people in each province as well as the standards of living. In addition marketeers won't be spending much money on acquiring agriculture produce from abroad as it will be produced locally and to those that add more value to the produce it will lower the cost of production as all the necessary raw materials won't be imported.
