Oxygen Bank is an initiative of the social enterprise Green Savers. As part of this initiative, students are inspired to donate small sums of money in the Bank from their lunch to pay for the Oxygen that they get free from nature.
The bank is opened each month and This money is then used to buy trees and take care of the trees planted in their school rooftop and premises.
