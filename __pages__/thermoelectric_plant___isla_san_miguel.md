> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The San Miguel plant has three generators, two of them new and recently installed, which guarantee 445 kW of firm power and deliver power to the entire island through a bank of single-phase transformers of 167 kVA per phase connected in delta-star for raise the generation voltage (480V) to the distribution voltage of 4.16kV. The more than 400 clients daily demand up to 160 kW in a residential type load profile but, due to their Christian devotion, it is common that during Holy Week and for the feast of their patron Saint Michael the Archangel (September 29) there is an increase in load that can reach more than 230 kW.
