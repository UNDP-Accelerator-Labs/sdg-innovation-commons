## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

1. What types of digital platform and digital technology are effective for Youth Connection? 2. What types of mobilization and partnership models are effective for increasing youth connections to skills, job and entrepreneurship? 3. What kinds of behavioral insights are critical for Unemployed Youth and Service Providers to connect with the technology? 4. What kinds of data innovations can help in better understanding, analysing and guiding the process at the field level and policy level as well? 5. How local and grassroots innovations can add better value in this comprehensive model?   

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF digital platforms and digital technologies can be equipped properly, THEN it will engage more youth with the skills, jobs and entrepreneurship. H2: IF priority actions are taken for local and participatory mobilisation of backward youths, THEN that will create enormous benefits for them to be connected with more decent works, skills, entrepreneurship ideas on sustainable living and development. H3: IF specific behavioural factors can be identified and considered in digital system designing and use of digital technologies THEN it will empower youth with more stratified information connecting them with technology and digital system enrollment to make their choices and actions in determining workable employment. H4: IF specific data innovations and data driven decision making can be formulated as well as implemented in facilitating the process THEN it can be used for better monitoring and strengthening the policy with effectiveness. H5: IF local and grassroot level innovations can be initialised and considered in connecting the youth with digital technology and decent employment, THEN mobilisation and local participation of those vulnerable youths will be much sustainable harnessing the effective networking.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Monetary and Non-monetary support from 3 UNDP projects, Government Agencies and other UN Agencies, like their time allocation, stakeholder connection, consultation, meeting venue allocation, time from traditional ethnic leaders and local govt., etc.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It is our observation that with social inclusion and diversification of different values have generated more insights for the innovative approach in connecting the youths with necessary skills.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

8 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

20K USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, based on the impact assessment there could be minor adjustment or follow-up of the program in order to evaluate the programs' effectiveness.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, primarily the initiative was planned to scale through developing proper skills for the unemployed youth based on their needs and interest. We have a plan to map and identify the unemployed youth from vulnerable small islands and equip them with skill training for capacity building and replicate the initiative at different places. The process implies the engagement of multiple partners including Ministry of local community, union council, technical training centres, skill training institute, Local Government Institutions, Local Administration, Bangladesh Tourism Board, UNDP projects, etc.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

While introducing market-driven skills development by the skills providers through job forecasting, challenges were somehow faced to locate future demand for the job. We got to know that lower awareness about ICT and digital platforms among the youth created some barriers while working on the frontier challenge. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Main difficulties we faced to identify which skill training would be appropriate for the unemployed youth. But as the youth registered into the NISE3 platform and they can enrol in a number of trade training provided by different associations and apply for jobs in the enterprises as per their requirements. However, we encountered the challenges through career counselling and guidance on industry searching and need-based skills training.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

As this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit the teams under UNDP. More specifically, the Experimentation team, SID-CHT team, and the skill training team of UNDP as because this experiment has created opportunities to work on unemployment problem aligning with SDGs and strategic plan of UNDP with connection to CPD.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The youths more specifically the unemployed ones including their families and the industries who are looking for skilled employees might get benefit from the results. The unemployed youth would be benefitted as this experiment would lead them to be employed and generate income for the family. Similarly, the government might also be benefitted as this initiative would help reducing unemployment and poverty rate as a mandate of the five years plan of the country. Also, the skills provider would be benefitted as they will have the mapping of skill demands and supply need.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, this experiment requires a certain number of iterations. As UNDP has a plan to provide skill training and employment to 300+ youths from Saint Martin's (one of the vulnerable small islands in Bangladesh) and then replicate the model in different small islands to thousands of participants in Bangladesh. The reason behind these initiatives is to ensure capacity building of the unemployed youths who have little or no literacy as a professional requirement. Moreover, those who are interested in overseas employment might also be in need of required skills which has ultimate effect on unemployment and increase income of the unemployed where poverty rate is above 50%.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Before initiating or replicating the experimental activity, they should examine the contextual background whether they need this kind of experimental activities or not. At the same time, cross checking with other country contexts, identifying the actual participants, ensuring efficient and expert trainers, providing necessary tools etc. are also needed to be considered while replicating this activity.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, Informality, Blue Tourism, Behavioural Insights and women empowerment. SDG 1,2, 11,16. But before replication, it should be kept under consideration that there are some cultural sensitivities in some areas. So, this cultural variation or sensitivity might prevent the replication of the experiment in some areas for example in gender cases.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

As our main challenge was to connect the youth with the right skills, employment, and entrepreneurship through the Intelligence Digital Platform in Bangladesh as the youth unemployment rate is high, so it was important to apply sensemaking and exploration of the area to the frontier challenge. This method connected the unemployed job seekers with real-time industries to be employed in jobs where they have full access to be employed with proper skills demands.

> What surprised you?

Surprisingly, all the relevant stakeholders including industries, skill providers, private enterprises, govt. agencies as well as local stakeholders and partners welcomed the experiment wholeheartedly and showed their keen interest to further working with the Accelerator Lab on this experiment.
