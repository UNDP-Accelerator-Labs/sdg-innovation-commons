A Japan-based social enterprise focusing on 1) Forest Regeneration & Biodiversity Restoration; 2) Saving Endangered Native Trees; 3) Awareness Raising & Knowledge Transfer; and 4) Research & Data Collection. Through the The Midorization Project, founder Motoharu NOCHI  introduced the first Miyawaki forest in the Arab world , and conducted forest regeneration as green infrastructure project with the Greater Amman Municipality, Jordanian Ministry of Environment, and GIZ. He is currently working on regenerating a Native Urban Forest in a public park in the heart of Amman in collaboration with a CBO Khidr Collective and Invest Bank. He has also been involved with starting up native sapling productions with local public and private nurseries. Nochi received his Bachelor’s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from Global College, Long Island University, USA, in 2006, and received training in forest regeneration using the Miyawaki Method (India 2018; Lebanon 2019; Turkey 2019; Japan 2018, 2019, & 2022).
