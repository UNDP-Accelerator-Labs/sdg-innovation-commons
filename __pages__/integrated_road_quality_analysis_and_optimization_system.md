> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The infrastructure of roads in Guinea Conakry

constitutes part of the great challenges that continue to impede economic

growth and development. Potholes and washouts in roads often make for hazardous

driving conditions due to lack of maintenance. The absence of efficient systems

for monitoring the state of roads, their classification and road maintenance

scheduling has led to a waste if resources. The lack of real-time data

collection and analysis slows down the identification, followed by maintenance

work for road repairs including the need to replace damaged infrastructure

prematurely. Inadequate Roads Decrease Mobility, Increases Transportation Costs

and Limit Access to Trade and Commerce These ruined roadways would then lead to

more accidents happening on the road, in turn posing great danger towards both

the drivers and pedestrians..

With all these problems, the most impacted are

everyday road users, who face increased travel times, higher vehicle

maintenance costs, and elevated risks of accidents due to poor road conditions.

Businesses involved in transportation face operational inefficiencies and

increased costs, impacting their profitability and reliability. Local

businesses and consumers suffer from supply chain disruptions, causing delays

and higher costs for goods. This situation is particularly severe in rural

communities, where poor road conditions limit access to essential services,

markets, and economic opportunities.

Additionally,

the deteriorating road conditions lead to increased frustration among the

population, often resulting in strikes and revolts against authorities. The

government and municipalities are challenged by the need to allocate limited

resources efficiently to maintain and improve road infrastructure.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



With a total road network of 45,300 kilometers, including 2,750 kilometers of roads asphalted, 15,515 kilometers of prefectural roads and 20,378 kilometers of roads community, the improvement of road infrastructure in the Republic of Guinea is of capital importance for boosting economic development, promoting connectivity regional and improve the quality of life of citizens. Significant investments in

modernization, maintenance and effective management of this network are necessary to overcome the

current challenges and ensure long-term sustainable development. 

The ISAORQ is part of a context where road infrastructure in Guinea presents many challenges. The road network is vast and diverse, with a preponderance of roads not paved, which makes their maintenance difficult and expensive. Significant budgetary constraints limit financing possibilities for rehabilitation and construction of new roads. In addition, climatic conditions extremes, such as heavy rains during the rainy season, cause damage significant damage to roads, including landslides and flooding. Security road is a major issue in Guinea, with poorly maintained roads contributing to a number high number of accidents. In this context, the inclusion of modern and innovative technologies becomes essential for the sustainable development of road infrastructure. The ISAORQ is based on the need to use advanced technologies to improve management

and maintenance of road infrastructure. By integrating sophisticated sensors, cameras and artificial intelligence algorithms, the system makes it possible to detect, analyze and locate road defects precisely and efficiently. The technological innovation offered by this project contributes to better planning and prioritization of repair work, thus optimizing the use of limited financial resources and reducing long-term costs term.

The inclusion of local communities and stakeholders in the detection process and repair of road defects will strengthen project ownership and ensure a response rapid and appropriate to the problems identified. In addition, the innovative approach of our solution promotes the development of safer and more sustainable road infrastructure, thus contributing to reducing accidents and improving the quality of life of citizens in general.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



As already mentioned, through the mapping of this solution, our Lab made it possible to highlight not only the basic solution, but also to adopt an approach centered on collective intelligence. By bringing together  stakeholders, we have created a workspace conducive to collaborative thinking, where everyone can share their ideas and experiences. This dynamic promotes a better understanding of the real needs and expectations of users. We then tried to optimize the design process, we integrated design thinking. This method allowed us to structure our thinking around empathy and experimentation. Through ideation sessions and rapid prototypes, we were able to test different approaches and iterate quickly based on user feedback.

At the same time, we conducted in-depth research and targeted interviews. These meetings were essential for collecting qualitative insights, thus making it possible to better understand the specific issues encountered by the community. The data obtained was integrated into the design process, thus reinforcing the relevance of the envisaged solution.

With this in mind, the Lab will use its tools and connections to facilitate the adoption of the solution by the management and get and other request base this time on RADDARs to detect High speed cars. At the same time, we are making sure to diffuse our initiative on available channels in order to increase its visibility. This visibility is crucial to raise the funds needed for prototyping, ensuring that our solution is not only viable but also sustainable and beneficial for the entire community.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



After solution mapping and the first ideation phase, we explored ways to raise funds. To do this, it was essential to conceptualize our project by drawing inspiration from similar cases, even at different scales, in order to write a solid concept note. Currently, we are collecting information on various fronts to prepare for the move to prototyping, which will allow us to collect essential data for analysis.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Our solution, if deployed, will represent a significant innovation. Until now, the Ministry of Transport,

which will be the key partner in this project, has only had rudimentary means to manage the maintenance of road infrastructure. It primarily relies on alerts from citizens via SMS and sometimes on collecting information from social networks, mainly Facebook. Although useful, this method is far from optimal and

does not effectively meet maintenance needs. Our solution will be the first to integrate sophisticated sensors to monitor the condition of roads in real-time. These sensors, combined with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, will enable the rapid and precise detection of road defects. The AI will analyze the collected data to propose quantified and optimized responses, significantly improving the speed of necessary repairs. Moreover, our solution is distinguished by its inclusive nature. It will allow local communities to actively contribute to solving road problems in their immediate environment. Citizens will be able to report road defects not only via SMS but also through voice messages, images, and videos. This participatory approach will strengthen collaboration between the government and citizens, making the road infrastructure maintenance process more transparent and effective. By leveraging the exceptional potential offered by AI and sensor technologies, our solution will bring a radical transformation to road management in Guinea. It will maximize resource utilization, reduce long-term costs, and ensure better quality road infrastructure, thereby contributing to the country's economic and social development.
