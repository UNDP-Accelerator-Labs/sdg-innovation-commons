The island of Alifu Alifu Thoddoo has a regular overnight ferry (famously known as the fruit ferry) from the island to Male’ for the daily transport of fresh agricultural produce to the capital. These ferries are owned and operated by local islanders and they offer a logistical solution to restaurant and guesthouse operators on the island, providing easy access to daily use groceries and other items usually not available on the island. Guesthouses and restaurant operator could give a list of groceries needed from Male’, and they are delivered to their doorstep on the island. This service offered by the fruit ferry enables a regular and consistent supply of goods needed for the operation of restaurants and guesthouses at a lower cost.
