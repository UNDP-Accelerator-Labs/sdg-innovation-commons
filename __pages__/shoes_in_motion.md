Moving Selling Booth

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Walking in the lively area of Al-Balad, I reached an open space that had a number of wheelbarrows attached to wood planks where different products were being sold. I asked one of the vendors why there were so many of them here and who started this trend. He mentioned that this technique was used a long time ago and originated in Yemen as he as well as many of the vendors there were from Yemen.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

How to utilize open public spaces. This may not be intentional, but finding other methods to transfer products easily with less carbon emission.
