> Title of the innovation

Peanut butter making,freezit making, animal farming ,such that poultry farming, dog farming ,etc. We are the three of us recently graduated from the natural resources development college where I did food and nutrition , and the other two guys majored in animal science and crop science. We have been trying to raise money to start up these businesses but resources have been scares so given an opportunity that is what we would do.

> Brief description of the innovation

As I have mentioned we are the three of us phaless, Harrison and Emmanuel who did agricultural and food and nutrition course ,since  the time we decided to go and study at the natural resources development college we want to learn how to keep chickens and grow crops but since we graduated we have been working so we can raise money to start up a freezit making, peanut butter making and animal farming business but resources have been scarce so given the opportunity we would achieve that because the knowledge is there and the willingness. And It will take us like 3 months for our innovation to show its impact because we seriously know what to do in order to achieve our goal and objectives and also how other youths will benefit when the Innovation is put in place .And the goals  help encourage,and motivate others especially the women ,girls and disabled to involve themselves in this innovation so that at least there able to stand on their own because this is a group which is most vulnerable to sexual attacks especially if people notice that they are not cabaple of fendind for themselves they tend to take advantage and mostly it's because of food ,shelter and clothing. So it is important to educate them on how important it is to become foodsecure because for the mind to actively function the stomach must be fed and how that is possible is by doing something rather than just sitting.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Firstly all the businesses will generate income because we  already have ideas on how to get them done as well as the market ,so as soon as we start the only thing left is to look for more customers to order freezits , already made peanut butter ,freezits and will be also grinding for the people at a fee . And also we shall be selling dressed chickens both to different hypermarkets like cheers as well as to the locals at wholesale price and retail to those that want. In the long run we may be able to employee other youths to help manage and grow the businesses . And to the already existing businesses we shall be helping them by giving them our produce at a better price or even on credit so long they don't give us reasons to doubt their business ethics. As far as I know all our business plans have no major impact on the environment as long as safety measures are put up. The value addition on the environment would be that we would even start utilizing the manure from the poultry houses to grow different types of crops.

> Technical Feasibility

The plan is to rent a poultry house in matero ,and buy what is necessary to start growing them ,and for the freezits and peanut butter to rent a small but with enough space then also to get what is needed to begin with the production.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the lives of by providing them with nutritious and safe protein source, it will allow others start up businesses and in the long run employment to both the women,girls and disabled.
