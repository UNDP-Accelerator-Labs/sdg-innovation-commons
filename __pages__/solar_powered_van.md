> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Marketing manager for renewable energy company, Solar Fiji, drives around a van installed with a mobile kitchen that is powered by solar energy. The van uses solar energy to power electrical items such as a fridge, coffee maker, and microwave. He stops in communities to chat about the van and hands out ice cream from the mobile solar-powered fridge. In doing this, he hopes to create awareness on the vast uses of solar energy, and expanding opportunities for mobile businesses. The van is also outfitted with lighting and charging points. He hopes it will encourage more locals to utilize solar energy as it is suitable to Fiji’s tropical climate, while at the same time is environmentally-friendly.
