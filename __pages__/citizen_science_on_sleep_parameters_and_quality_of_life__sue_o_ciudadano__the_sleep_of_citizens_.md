## Overall goal

Map sleep and wake habits in Argentina by jointly collecting anonymous data on mobile phone use, analyzing individual and community variables affecting sleep (demographics, geographical location, etc.), and producing a set of recommendations, based on this evidence, about adequate circadian rhythm and sleep regimens. 
## Description of citizen participation

 Citizens collect data through a report on the use of their mobile phones and behaviors in relation to sleep and wakefulness. They also participate in public dissemination campaigns of the initiative and the production of recommendations to formulate future public policies based on gathered evidence.
