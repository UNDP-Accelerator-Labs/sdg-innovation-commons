> Title of the innovation

Gardening and cultivation

> Brief description of the innovation

Promoting Agricultural skills to teenagers and imparting skills that will enable them do different types of farming activities according to the seasons.
When this is done our children will not have the mentality of waiting upon government to employ them but rather they will generate their own source of income as well as creat jobs to their fellows.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The value addition, is that farming is one of the important implementation one can never go wrong with.
When teenagers are skilled with farming skills this will help our society to have more production of different crops and this will attract more exchange rate. Crops like soya beans, sun flower, ground nuts, rice, wheat, potatoes and many more are on demand at the market at any season.
These are some of the crops that are needed most to teach them how they are grown and taken care of. Money is generated when you sell them because these kinds of crops are expensive. This will enhance our community to develop and keep the skills implemented in all generations to come.

> Technical Feasibility

We need a farm for demo ( learning of different farming skills and how to farm certain crops). We need farming equipments and farming attires.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Farming is one of the best investment one never go wrong with, we have seen people of different races and colors venturing into farming and very few are not doing well due to maybe lack of skills. But alot are making money and living well, so we also can improve our living if get it and do it seriously.
