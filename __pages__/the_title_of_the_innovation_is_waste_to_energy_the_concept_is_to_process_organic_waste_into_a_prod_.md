> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is about harnessing organic waste's energy, adding value to waste, waste to energy, waste to cash and designed to support sustainable living through the processing of organic waste into an alternative source of heat energy for cooking and heating.
The following shall be used as raw-materals 
-starch rich organic waste(waste nshima)
-carbon rich organic waste (bones,chicken feathers ,poultry waste, dead leave/grass, eggshells, sawdust,fruit peels, discarded paper and maize(cabs, stalk, and peels)
Bio-charcoal is designed to take in organic waste as raw-materials.
The following makes my innovation unique.
Nshima been the staple meal of many Zambians in lusaka.My innovation targets waste nshima from house holds and restaurants.Waste nshima conteins starch and starch is important in bio_charcoal production . According to a survey I conducted in thisa,chip at a, mandevu and marrapodi compound , out of 100% nshima cooked or produced every day at household and restaurant level, 2%(20grams) is waste inform of leftovers, 8%(80grams) is thrown away after generated during the cleaning of the pot used to cook the nshima.This gives me confidance of avalability of raw-materals.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will generate income through mass production of the product and selling it to potential customers at a profit.Others will generate income through the collection of raw-materials (organic waste) on my behalf at a fee.My target market/potential offtakers are coal dependant businesses like cooking oil manufacturing companies, Breweries, Thermal power plants and Charcoal dependant businesses like Peanut butter producers.Coal produces sulfur dioxide which causes formation of acid rains .Acid rains damages water bodies and kill life in water.Charcoal promotes deforestation which contributeas to climate change.My innovation can improve oparetions of the above industries in terms of reducing emission of sulfur  dioxed, dependance on non renewable energy and can be a substitute for charcoal.
The challenge price will help my business grow in following areas -Register my business, Aquire equipment that can help me upscale production,Invest in further development of the innovation like laboratory testing and create a business website.
No deforestation or mining is required to produce the product, the innovation can help to reduce organic waste in the environment and it promotes environmental conservation.

> Technical Feasibility

Raw materials needed to produce 1kg of bio-charcoal.
_2kg of carbon rich organic waste .
_0.1kg of starch rich organic waste.
Recipe for bio_charcoal production.
2kg carbon rich waste is carbonized to 0.9kg carbon materials then crushed , screened to obtain carbon powder, mix the powder with blended waste nshima, the mixture is pressed in a mold to form bio-charcoal pieces , dryed and ready for the market.

I have 45kgs of bio_charcoal existing as prototype.

Implementation plan
_putup a shade/workshop
_Equip the workshop
_clear space for raw material storage
_set price for buying raw material per kg
_ organize raw material collectors/aggrigators
_start production
_use social media to market the product.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can create new jobs and help to grow the waste recycling sector, it is a solution to the organic waste management problem Lusaka city is facing and a solution that changes people's mind set, it shall make them look at waste as an income generator.

The innovation is relevant to current market because the source of heat energy on the market(coal and charcoal) are destroying the environment during their production 
The innovation behind my product is meant to conserve the environment.
