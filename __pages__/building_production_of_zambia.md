Building production of Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Making of building material like paint bricks and doors and alot more at one company. 
To create jobs opportunities for every citizen can lead to best development of the country.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With my income it wouldn't be much of the challenge.  But most of the talented youths in the country don't have anyone to help them but if we make this company  to produce and sell paint and bricks or any building material all over the country with the income coming we can employ them to be making the products and selling them. 
Not only will the youths be employed but the country can develop by building more schools with the brick product being made and paint them. 
Building of houses for orphans and street kids would be easy for that.

> Technical Feasibility

Employing experienced and trained  youths and buy matchings that can be used to make products to sell. On that information we can also start enrolling unexperienced youths to learn from the trained ones. 
FYI. we can start exporting the products to other countries with this the dollar currency will be dropping down if we make more exports to other countries. 
And with this the country will be developing in no time

> Anticipated Social Impact

If 40% or the country youths get employed on this production and 30% of the country youths get enrolled on this production the there will be a change and development in each province
