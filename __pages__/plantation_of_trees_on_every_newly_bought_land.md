> Title of the innovation

Plantation of trees on every newly bought land

> Brief description of the innovation

Mostly when people buy land, they cut down most of the trees which they, hence promoting global warming and bringing about climate change like low rainfall. Therefore, if every buyer who buys land is asked at least to have 4 tress in the yard, that will be good for our country and the world at large. For example some lands that have been sold in Mitengo were houses have been built, there are no trees in some land and the places look horrible. So let’s reinforce the planting of trees on sold land.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through the plantation of trees, there will be a turn out in the amount of rainfall will be having in the country. Thus, more farming and growing of crops, and when there is good crop production even animals benefit, like cattle, goats, chickens, pigs, etc. definitely, it may not generate income for me directly, but others who have farms will benefit. And this exercise will make a great impact on our land in terms of rain and availability of enough food for other animals. Furthermore, the trees will even be beneficial to the people who planted them in terms of oxygen exchange and also fruits.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation to be effective I will need to work with the council and the ministry of lands, to make sure that there are trees at the plots. The owners of the houses will have to buy trees if there liking.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Quietly the innovation will mostly help our future world and our future children. The innovation will bring about proper sanitation to people because trees play a vital role in our daily living. And as stated earlier, farmers will be one of the people who will benefit more.
