## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Supporting the innovation ecosystem in Sierra Leone
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that there are limited spaces for innovators to explore their ideas and create viable prototypes that can be experimented on

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Since the inception of the Acclab in Sierra Leone, we discovered that there are a lot of innovative thinking by young people and they are trying to create prototypes in their own spaces using mainly scrap materials collected from waste sites. These prototypes are usually a safety hazard due to the lack of proper fabrication materials and tools. Running experiments on them becomes a challenge. So we want to works with partners, mainly academic institutions, to establish fabrication labs in the four regions in Sierra Leone, so that young people with creative ideas can get the support they need closer to home to create prototypes and run tests safely.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



We aim to ignite innovation for sustainable development by fostering a culture of design, innovation and resilience. Collaborating with academic institutions to leverage their technical knowledge and access to space to develop the skills of innovators and entrepreneurs, focusing on computer aided designs and use of modern equipment to fabricate prototypes. The regional fabrication labs will also be a space that facilitates exchange of ideas between young innovators and industry experts. Promoting a culture of innovation and incorporating it into educational curricula and community programs. The regional fab labs will also leverage on the work of the UniPod program, and ideas from the regions can feed into the UniPod for a more holistic approach.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How do we engage with local communities, innovators, academia, government and other stakeholders to build trust and gather insights into the specific needs and challenges of innovation in Sierra Leone?


How do we integrate entrepreneurship education into academic curricula to instil a culture of innovation and risk-taking?


How will the fabrication lab be sustainably funded in the long-term? what business strategies can be put in place?





> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Collective intelligence: gather information, and leverage ideas and solution from key stakeholders
Design thinking: understand what are the needs of innovators in Sierra Leone and how a fab labs can be structured to support them
Participatory design: involving the innovators and key stakeholders in designing the concept and methodology of the fab labs, so they own the process and it becomes sustainable
Pilots: test the establishment of a fab lab in small scale at one university
Systems thinking: understand what are the current ways innovators get access to innovation hubs. How can this current system be enhanced and work with the fab lab facility

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



ecosystem mapping: understand what facilities are currently available, what is there scope?
Ethnography: community information gathering
Focus group: bring together groups of innovators
Questionnaire: needs assessment survey 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Collaboration with private sector actors could be a strategy for sustaining a fab lab in the long run.
