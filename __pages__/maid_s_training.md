> Title of the innovation

Maid s training

> Brief description of the innovation

Maids training  provides  employment  to mostly  woman in our community. We give a skill to them,to alleviate  poverty. Clients  are also provided  with house helps in order to help them do their  work properly  when they  go for work..

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income is generated, when clients, pay the money when getting  the maids  to go  and work in the compounds. A percentage  of their salary  is given to the maid centre, when the maids are  paid their  aalaries. Business  can only grow when we have good infrastructure  and increase  in the number of maids.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed  plan is when we have a good BOARDING school  for maids. So they can be taught  how to run  people s homes well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The lives of most woman in these communities  are changed because  an income is earned by the end of  the month.
