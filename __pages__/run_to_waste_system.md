Description: In this system, nutrients are not recycled, but the plant receives a new mixture of nutrients constantly. The nutrients that have already been used are discarded by a final drain.

These systems typically use a substrate with a liquid retention similar to that of soil. That is, substrates maintain a high degree of humidity for a long period of time.  

Interesting feature: In this system there is no nutrient depletion, since the plant receives fresh nutrients at each intake.
