## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Greening Timor-Leste
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our main challenges are lack of integration in public sector policy and laws so as collective action in the ground to support the enhance the people understanding of the importance and fundamental reason of wildlife preservation and the protection of the nature environment and its country ecosystems. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Within the last five decades (since 1972 till the present time), Timor Leste Forest cover has been declining to be around 50%-70% although concise study on the issue still needs to be conducted, however the data obtain from various sources cited that, approximately since 1972 to 1999 alone, the loss of forest cover of the country is reaching the figure of 30%.   Shifting Cultivation, which used unsustainable agriculture technique, animal grazing, land used changes and rapid development of the country infrastructure, activities have been a major contributor to the loss of forest cover as well as lands degradation and has become the triggering factor for lowering the land productivity as well as increased the land area for desertification. Once the land is degraded and become deserted, the ground water quantity is diminished, agriculture production is low, land productivity is low and bare land is drying out, and prone to erosion etc.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

TLS Accelerator Lab can promote innovation at UNDP by harnessing our collective intelligence methods to government agencies, community members, NGOs and private sectors who are working to tackle the tree planting issue in the capital city of Dili. UNDP TLS used to have recycling project, but it will end in June however its legacy remains an important value to be continued. It is also a good opportunity for UNDP to partner with unusual partners to ensure changes in approaching waste management issue are used.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Human wellbeing and quality of life for every citizen in Timor-Leste depends on healthy and productive natural and environmental resources as 75 % of its people live in rural areas and rely on natural resources for their livelihoods and incomes. However, lack the knowledge, skills or means to manage their resources sustainably resulting their natural resource management practices are unsustainable. Effective implementation of the Strategic Development Plan (SDP) of the governments would help to ensure more sustainable utilization of natural resources, minimize natural and environmental degradation, alleviate poverty, reduce unemployment, and improve food security. This needs a strong emphasis on capacity building for all stakeholders’ farmers, fishers, civil society, private sector, and Government agencies, therefore the SDP can be implemented in a cohesive manner.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Point of View: Both people and the government need to improve their behaviour towards nature and environment conservation and its ecosystem issues because degradation of environment will create a huge damage to people wellbeing and sustainable development of the country. How might we change the way we understand about protection and conservation of the nature and environment?  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The selected methods will harness collective understanding related to nature conservation and forest protection issue in Timor-Leste and inform participants on possible ways to contribute and feel the effect of collective decision-making when mutual decision is reach, disseminated, and acted upon.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The current data is lacking user experience data and often the data is outdated. In addition, currently there is no evidence on how data on forest protection and conservation is collected and informed current policy on management of these data
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

How might the new approach on conservation and forest protection & help people improving their income?
