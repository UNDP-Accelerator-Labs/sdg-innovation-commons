> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The Innovación Educativa project is linked to an action learning plan focused on educational transformation through digital innovation. It involves collaboration between universities (such as UNIFRANZ) and the United Nations Development Programme (PNUD) to create a network of educational innovation. The aim is to provide teachers, students, and parents with updated digital tools and training to improve educational quality. The project leverages bootcamps, sprints, and workshops to enhance competencies and adapt to modern educational demands​

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The Innovación Educativa activity aims to explore how digital tools and innovative teaching methods can improve educational outcomes and teacher-student engagement in Latin America. The goal is to enhance 21st-century skills by training educators and creating a collaborative, updated learning environment.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is vital because it addresses the need for modernizing education, fostering digital literacy, and ensuring students and educators have the necessary tools to thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF digital tools and innovative teaching methods are implemented in educational institutions through the Innovación Educativa project, THEN the quality of education will improve, leading to enhanced student engagement, teacher effectiveness, and the development of 21st-century skills.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Teacher Training:

Conduct workshops and bootcamps for teachers to adopt and integrate digital tools into their teaching methods.
Collaboration with Partners:

Work with universities (like UNIFRANZ) and PNUD to create a network of educational innovation.
Implementation in Schools:

Pilot the use of digital tools and modern teaching strategies in partner schools across Latin America.
Timeline:

The project spans a few months with ongoing workshops, culminating in measurable improvements in student engagement and teacher effectiveness
