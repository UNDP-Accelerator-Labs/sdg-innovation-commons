Overall goals: • Highlight the importance of crowdsourcing data which may be later used for optimal water resource management. • Promote interinstitutional and intra-institutional work, by encouraging the partaking of students at different educational levels. • Foster the involvement of public and private schools of any kind. • Plan the participation of residents in recording hydrometeorological data. Specific goals: • Record and analyze weather data to characterize particular physical phenomena (for example, heavy storms) occurring in the area; also, contribute to the determination of certain methodological aspects and to instrumentation making. • Establish ties at every educational level between public and private educational establishments. • Crowdsource data to co-create knowledge with the aim to mitigate the effects of environmental hazards (floods, droughts, wildfires, pollution, etc.) 

Description of citizen participation: Children and young people carry out hydrological and hydrometeorological measurements and build their own low-cost instruments. These instruments are validated by comparison with official instruments (for example, the instruments are installed in the National Weather Service educational experimental fields). Additionally, the students are promoters of what they have learned, applying it to their daily environment. Private residents have been incorporated to collaborate with data recording, giving rise to MATTEO R., where the R in the last name (Ravagli) refers to Residents. Today, schools from the MATTEO project are currently participating in international scientific projects such as PREVENIR project, funded by the Science Agency of Japan.
