## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Using Collective Intelligence to Accelerate the Just Energy Transition in South Africa 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the most vulnerable groups who will be affected by the Just Transition, namely coal miners, women, and youth, have not been sufficiently consulted regarding their futures during and after the transition.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

South Africa generates about 80 percent of its electricity through coal and is in the grip of an energy crisis. According to a study conducted by COP26, South Africa is the world’s 13th biggest source of greenhouse gases and will need to spend over $250 billion to transition to net-zero CO2 emissions in South Africa by 2050.

The local social and economic effects of mine closures will be significant and highly concentrated; the majority of Eskom’s coal plants — and the mines that supply them — are located within a 100km radius. Closure of mines will result in loss of livelihoods for miners and the communities built around them. Closing mines not only displaces mine workers, but disproportionately impacts workers in related sectors i.e., transport, and entire communities in surrounding coal regions. This is particularly true of isolated regions where infrastructure and services are tied to mining. In these communities, mine closure will affect all economic activity. Many coal-producing countries lack the resources needed to protect workers and communities, remediate impacted lands, and capitalize on the economic opportunities a transition away from coal makes possible. In addition, the relatively high earnings in mining means it will prove difficult to develop equivalent livelihoods when coal employment begins to decline

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

1) By incorporating their preferences on sustainable livelihoods into JET policies, we will help coal miners to feel heard and included in designing their future.

2) By enabling coal miners to express their preferences regarding sustainable livelihoods, we will help the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) to contribute to conflict resolution/reduction to assist in accelerating the Just Transition UNDP is a ‘neutral’ organisation within this highly politicised topic, and can use this status to surface valuable insights. The AccLab is uniquely positioned to use Collective Intelligence to draw on a wide range of data to provide the above value. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The South African AccLab will be surfacing insights regarding alternative livelihood options and relocation preferences from vulnerable groups affected by the Just Energy transition, such as coal miners, and women and youth in coal mining communities

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are coal miners’ preferences regarding alternative livelihood options, future skills, and relocation preferences in relation to the Just Energy Transition; How can the vulnerable groups affected by the Just Energy Transition have their voices heard? What are key factors in decreasing potential conflict and contestation in the implementation of a Just Energy Transition? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These methods will allow us to capture and codify the data we collect from selected respondents, while also allowing an adaptive, bottom-up approach to incorporate unexpected themes and insights 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Though some consultations have taken place with coal mining communities, these have been very broad and have not allowed for communities themselves to express their preferences. By drawing on this data, we can increase the justice in the just transition 
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We have already begun to reach out to partners working in this area. Thus far these include the EU Delegation to South Africa, South African Institute of International Affairs, Global Change Institute, UNICEF, etc.
