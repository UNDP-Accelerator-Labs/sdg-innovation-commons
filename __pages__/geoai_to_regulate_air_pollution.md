> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To address challenges at intersectionality of SDGs

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we develop GeoAI platform to detect hotspots of air pollution Then we can support regulatory authorities towards better regulation of air pollution

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

0. Create prototype of solution 1. Establish partnerships  Data partnership with University of Nottingham;  Partnerships with government agencies to co-create and implement the platform Partnerships with civil society for joint implementation 2. Co-create GeoAI platform 3. Capacity building on how to use the platform 4. Implement the GeoAI platform through field inspection 5. Support government agencies in taking action against environmental compliance identified through platform & field validation 6. Support government in soft actions that can help industries switch to cleaner technologies. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters measured: Number & Percent of brick kilns non-compliant to environment regulation ; Emissions and AQI across regions

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Open satellite data (Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5), Field validation of AI models using Mobile App, Web App (survey-based methods) of GeoAI platform; AQI readings from sensors (Govt infrastructure CCAQM stations)

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

20 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Using less than $20,000 seed money, we have leveraged resources to the tune of 0.8 million USD through technical collaborations
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

12 months, since brick kiln industry operates only for 6 months each year. The field inspections were delayed due to two lockdowns which happened during operational period of brick kilns

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

$15,000 for developing GeoAI platform by AccLab $4,500 for hosting infrastructure (cloud) by AccLab $40,000 by government of Bihar for implementation $50,000 by government of Chhattisgarh  $40,000 by government of Odisha (planned) $500,000+ by University of Nottingham on research (Data Scientists at Rights Lab)

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, one of the scaleup plan involves developing a complete 'digital stack on air pollution' to support regulatory governance of state pollution control boards. Our environment pillar (program pillar) is pitching this initiative to various states and central pollution control board for scaleout.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Covid lockdowns prevented field inspections during operational cycle of brick kilns (6 months each year) Many clauses of conflict/ambiguity while establishing data partnership - took 4 months to crack

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Environment portfolio has scale-up plans for pan-India implementation of the experiment to support regulatory governance on air pollution.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

NGO partners are intervene better in their air pollution projects. Our NGO partner Development Alternatives is scaling to other states using this platform. GeoAI is also providing ecosystem services and technological mileage for development organizations to deepen their initiatives.

> What surprised you?

3 States governments in India adopted this platform for state-wide monitoring & regulation of brick kilns in - Bihar, Odisha & Chhattisgarh - even before pilot results were produced. All the 3 states are poorest geographies in India and feature among the bottom quartile in HDI ranking.  Aha moment: Emerging technologies can have traction even in poorer states with low digital capacities - possibility of leapfrogging
