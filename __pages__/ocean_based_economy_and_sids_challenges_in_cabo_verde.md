Ocean-Based Economy and SIDS challenges in Cabo Verde


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is how to empower local communities around blue economy sectors to bring sustainable local-based solutions to development, in the context of SIDS challenges in Cabo Verde.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

“Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face a unique set of vulnerabilities which impede their ability to achieve sustainable development. Structural factors, including their size, remoteness, limited resource base, market size, exposure to climate risks and natural disasters impact socio economic outcomes and their ability to achieve the SDGs. The COVID- 19 pandemic amplified those vulnerabilities with many SIDS countries being particularly affected by the drop in international tourism and travels and international remittances.” – in The Decade of Action and Small Island Developing States: Measuring and addressing SIDS’ vulnerabilities to accelerate SDG progress - working Paper, Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

Cabo Verde is no exception as a small, undiversified, highly open (and exposed to international shocks) economy, with challenging natural environment (longstanding droughts, limited resources) which increases vulnerabilities and hinders development progress

The country is characterized by a small territory with approximately 4.000 km2, composed by 10 islands, located about 500 miles from the West African coast. The country has performed well in the past four decades, achieving graduation to Middle-Income Country in 2007, largely fueled by strong European markets which contribute to both remittances and tourism in the country, meeting most of its human development objectives under MDGs, particularly in health and education. 

Graduation from the LDC category raised a new set of challenges to finance sustainable development. Countries that graduate from the LDC group are faced with reduction in concessional financing and withdrawal of preferential trade agreements. Moreover, in the case of Cabo Verde, LDC graduation coincided with the global financial crisis (in 2008), leading to high debt distress, hindering the country’s ability to finance crucial SDG investments.

Following the financial crisis and LDC graduation, Cabo Verde’s level of development (measured by GNI) has declined and socioeconomic challenges linked to rising inequalities are emerging. One major area of inequality is youth unemployment, which was estimated in 32.5% in 2020. Another source of rising inequalities is linked with rapid growth in the tourism sector. Tourism is concentrated in two islands, Sal and Boavista (with more than 80% of tourists), but these Islands are some of the least populated in the country and the tourism sector does not create linkages with the local economy. Very little farming activity takes place on these islands and transportation connecting hotels with more fertile islands, which could promote local sourcing, remains poor.

SIDS vulnerabilities further impede progress. Cabo Verde struggles to achieve economies of scale and competitiveness due to its small market size. Access to credit continues to limit the ability of MSMEs to develop and the country struggles to overcome its narrow base for production and diversification. The EU (Portugal and Spain) accounts for more than 70% of imports to Cabo Verde and receives 85% of the country's exports. In 2021, exports of fish and fishery products represented 83.5% of total merchandise trade. 

Cabo Verde also faces the challenge of geographic fragmentation, which requires substantial infrastructure financing, leading to major infrastructure constraints including high-energy costs and lack of inter-island transportation. Each island requires separate infrastructure which results in multiplier effects on costs. Basics like energy, water, transportation and telecoms must be duplicated several times across each inhabited island and have a cost above the world average.

Water scarcity is also a growing and costly challenge. Cabo Verde has one of the most expensive water tariffs in Africa (over USD $3/m3) and low water consumption per capita (below recommended global standard). Water shortages, long-term drought, and poor soil create additional barriers in many of the Cabo Verde islands. With less than 10 percent of its surface as arable land and limited mineral resources, Cabo Verde is also at disadvantage for agricultural production.

Finally, Cabo Verde is particularly vulnerable to the impact of extreme weather events. Extreme weather events have a greater impact on SIDS due to their small scale. Droughts, volcanic activity, flooding and other forms of extreme weather have economic and social costs and limits Cabo Verde’s sustainable development. Cabo Verde also faces significant challenges associated with climate change, especially rising sea levels and greater frequency of severe weather patterns, including droughts and flooding.

Poverty Profile

35% of total population, 48.5% in rural areas, lowest in Sal &amp; Boavista Islands (2015) 

Youth Unemployment (15-24 years Old) is 32,5% in 2020 

Tourism (Impact of Covid-19)

Number of tourists and night stays with 75% reduction in 2020, with Covid-19 pandemic

Tourism (Concentration in Sal and Boavista Islands)

Sal and Boa Vista with more than 80% of night stays in 2020

GDP

Agriculture and fisheries representing only 5% of GDP in 2020

 

Employment

Agriculture and fisheries representing more than 13% of employment in 2020

 

Exports of goods

More than 85% of exports to EU and is fisheries products 

LDC Criteria

 Although Cabo Verde graduated from the LDC category, it did not meet the economic vulnerability (EVI) criteria. The EVI captures many important SIDS vulnerabilities (including population size, remoteness, extreme weather, export concentration, etc.). Cabo Verde’s EVI ranking remains above the threshold for LDC EVI criteria (above 35 out of 100) and has stagnated more than a decade following graduation due mainly to agricultural instability and natural disasters.

Competitiveness Index Ranking

Cabo Verde’s infrastructure is ranked is 109 out of 141 countries in the WEF’s Global Competitiveness Index 2019.

· Tourism represent more than 25% of GDP with little linkages with the local economy. A small undiversified economy highly vulnerable to external shocks. Covid-19 pandemic came prove this with sharp reduction in tourist income resulting in a historic reduction of -15% in GDP in 2020;

· Ocean fisheries are principal to the nation’s sustainable livelihoods and food security. The sector has great potential and is a country priority;

· Poverty rates are highest amongst rural and coastal communities;

· Rural households rely almost entirely upon relatively inexpensive and historically easy to access marine resources for subsistence and income, but facing significant challenges;

· Near the coast maritime resources has been decreasing in the past few years. Artisanal fishers face many challenges and have to go further into the sea with little conditions (normally in small boats with poor conditions, raising security issues) to find fishes and obtain income for subsistence;

· Low aggregate value to artisanal fishing. Incipient logistic channels and marketplaces.

· Potential new source of income from activities connected to tourism and ecotourism

· Proposed Innovations to fishery sector include: New activities to fishermen’s connected to tourism (including maritime tourism guide, ecotourism, recreative fishing and diving); Improve the distribution value chain using digital channels and solutions; Improve security using georeferentiation systems; Use research and the scientific community to help identify new species and locate sustainable resources (with technology).

· Unsustainable economic activities in the Ocean: overfishing, plastic, habitat destruction, chemical pollution, deoxygenation, etc.;

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We want to understand which and how economic activities connected to the ocean can have more potential to be a sustainable source of income for local communities in the context of the opportunities of blue economy and SIDS challenges in Cabo Verde.



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

To conduct open innovation challenges, in hackathon format, and implement methodologies like human-centered design and design-thinking to engage with local target-groups to co-create / co-design solutions, develop and test prototypes that addresses their needs in the context of the opportunities of blue economy and SIDS challenges in Cabo Verde.



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Statistical information about the Blue Economy sector is a challenge. Only general information about it is open to the public for analysis in the National Statistics Institute (economic data and GDP). Detailed sectorial data about fishery and other Blue Economy domains are not easily accessible. Some public institutions (like National Directions, Institute for the Sea, etc.) own more detailed data about the sector, but still working to make more factual information available to the public.
