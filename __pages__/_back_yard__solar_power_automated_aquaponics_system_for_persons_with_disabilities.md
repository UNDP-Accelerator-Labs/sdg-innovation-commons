## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

30th March 2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Agriculture - Food Security In Small Island Developing States (SIDs)

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

In St Lucia, manual approaches to farming may be prohibitive based on the type of disability which a person faces. Additionally, many smallholder farms are located on hillsides and are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change induced events. Therefore, the disabled are vulnerable and are at a higher risk for food insecurity. While other projects focus on large scale community farming solutions, such an approach is not tailored to specific individuals who present with a range of disabilities.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can a low space(Back Yard) automated Aquaponics System powered by solar be used to reduce food insecurity for persons with disabilities.

  

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Government of St Lucia through our EnGenDer Project
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiment seeks to determine if the use of emerging technologies and renewable energy systems to can be used to create an automated aquaponics farming systems for persons with disabilities. This experiment seeks to determine if the manual work required to run a successful aquaponics system can be reduced to as little manual overhead as possible in a small space “Back Yard” which is suitable for use by a disabled homeowner/non-Farmer. The solution considers the following:

1. Renewable energy for power.

2. Automated monitoring of water quality.

3. Nutrient management.

4. Cleaning of the system. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Emerging technology such as sensor systems coupled with renewable energy systems can be used to reduce the manual work required to run a sustainable aquaponics system in a "Back Yard" enabling persons with Disabilities to adopt its use.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

This experiment comprises of 3 stages:

Stage 1: The Selection of individuals with disabilities to be part of the experiment.  In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture partners in St. Lucia based on the need, types of disability, space availability and willingness/ability to participate, individuals will be selected for the experiment. Selection will also take into account other factors, including but not limited to location and social vulnerability.

Stage 2: Designing of the tailored system. Each system will be designed based on the identified cases with guidance from the ministry and other partners. This ensures the designs consider already existing technical knowledge in country.

Stage 3: Testing and evaluation of the system. The validation exercise seeks to deploy the designed systems in the environment based on the selected participants. The functionality and applicability will be adjusted based on the use case.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The ability for each participant to:

Manage the aquaponics system with no assistance for another person. (Reduction in effort required to manage the system on their own. Ease of Use)

Number of days the system can operate without being connected to a power source other than solar energy. (Reduction of cost required to maintain the system.) 

Amount of water required to run the system. (Increased efficiency of water used compared to traditional systems.)

Amount of output of crops from the system.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Interviews and Focus Groups.

Observations.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

April 2023 - September 2023 (6 Months)

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
