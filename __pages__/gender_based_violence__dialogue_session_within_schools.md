## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The intent is to test whether the creation of dialogue sessions within schools with the education community can change attitudes and behaviors towards gender issues and discrimination.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF the education community dialogues about gender issues and discrimination THEN the attitudes and behaviors of the actors of the community will change. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Diagnose the dynamics of the education community before the intervention 2. Develop skills to communicate 3. Implement sessions of dialogue on the key topics 4. Creating feasible futures to change identified issues 5. Build working plans between the education community 6. Implement working plans 7. Evaluate and test working plans to adjust and iterate 8. Syntesize good practice and lessons learned

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Unit of analysis: children, teachers, head teachers and parents behavior change

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Various qualitative methods to collect data

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 - 7 months
