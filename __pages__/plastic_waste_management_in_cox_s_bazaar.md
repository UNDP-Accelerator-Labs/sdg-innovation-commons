Cox's Bazaar - the world's longest uninterrupted sea beach and the major tourist spot of Bangladesh - accumulates a huge amount of plastic waste each day, mostly from bottles and cans littered by tourists. A solutions mapping visit to the region uncovered that a local NGO is working on managing these waste by recycling - collecting the plastic waste, sorting them into different categories and reselling them. The video shows solution mapper Sohara Mehroze explaining the process of sorting the plastic in the recycling facility.
