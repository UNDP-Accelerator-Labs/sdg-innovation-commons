Chiwanangala Integrated Fish and Livestock Enterprises Limited

> Brief description of the innovation

Chiwanangala integrated fish and livestock enterprises limited is a private business innovation registered with pacra in 2018 on the 19th October. the business facility is located in Chingola south Copperbelt Zambia on a 1.6 acres piece of land. our vision is to produce quality foods such as fish, chicken and pig meat. Our mission is also to maximize higher profit base while operating at lower production cost, with quality inputs. We also plan to diversify our business operations in order to grow the financial economy of our business establishment Currently we are focusing on fish farming and poultry business, which we have started on a small scale. At present we have three usable ponds with to ponds already stocked with tilapia anderson. The other pond is also complete but is under maintenance. Once the establishment. of our businesses is set to operate at full capacity, we will employ  youths and lemon whom we will train to work efficiently. and effectively to enable produce quality products.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If we produce six thousand full grown fish each weighing  600 grams  priced at K45 per kg, our gain in this harvest will be; 6000 x 600 / 1000 x 45 = K162000 per harvest per pond. Meaning our target of six ponds will earn us K972000 per annum.
Also our poultry. is focused to produce 300 eggs per day when we acquire 300 hens. we presume when these three hundred eggs are incubated will hatch 250 chicks which will be sold as day old chicks at K20 each, meaning K5000 will be earned for this batch of chicks, and when 10 batches are successfully done, K50000 will be earned in less than a month. If the chicks are raised to mature for four to six months, then the average for Rowan Rangers Chicken at the  market is K110 and K27500 can be realized from the 250 chicken. also sales of some manure from the poultry will be sold to earn us income while buyers such as small scale famers will benefit this supply at a cheaper price as compared to the cost of fertilizers . Usually our products will be open to the markets  ranging from individuals, shop owners restaurants butcheries, guest houses, hospitals e.t.c. Our prices of the products are accommodative because of the lover production costs which we have in place through integrated system.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently we are also running a small poultry of Rowan Rangers chicken and we capitalize on the dropping which we treat as manure to fertilize the ponds, and our fish finds feed on this staff. We also feed our fish with maize bran to which we mix with kapenta debris. however ever we also feed our fish with processed feed. Recently we harvested good size of fish weighing  between 450 grams and 600 grams and feeding was based on the above. 
Our proposed implementations is still to better our feeding methods of both fish and chicken with the use of animal dropping. such us cow manure which can be left for a while to produces feed for fish and chicken. The use of maize bran mixed with  kapenta debris, have proved to be nutritious for both fish and chicken especially when used alternatively with processed feed such us grower.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Fish is naturally a high nutritious kind of food which is consumed by many people on the globe. And because of this many people are involved in the fish processing industry. Therefore employment is created for many and through this the lives  of many people are improved our proposed innovation will just endeavor to do the same as explained above and try to eradicate Poverty, Provide good healthy and well-being and create decent work and economic growth..
