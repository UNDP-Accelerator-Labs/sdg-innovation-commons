## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

 The learning intent was to Identify stakeholders along the plastic waste processing value chain, map stakeholders active in the circular economy. Produce business models for youth support associations to support youth unemployment 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If people are shown the value of processing plastic waste, the it can provide an opportunity to employ young people and clean up the city.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experimentation took place in Bukavu, where Accelerator Lab  worked with the town councils, NGOs and institutes working on the issue to support this phase. The main task was to provide solution providers with a public space or secondary road where the paving stones would be laid.

The town of Bukavu identified and designated solution providers, who were monitored, coached and incubated by Kivutech during the experimental phase. At the end of the experimentation, a capitalization workshop was organized to be presented to government authorities and development sector players with a view to scaling up.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Tonnes of garbage transformed in to paver blocks

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Identify stakeholders and record them in the database using Kivutech incubetor, data collection form co-created with the AccLab, KivuTech and representatives of 8 start-ups involved in the project.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

5 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

proven, Creation of temporary jobs for over 150 unemployed people aged between 18 and 39. For 11 tons of waste to be sorted, spread over 6 different sites, 17 people were needed, with an average age of 23 and an average wage of $3.7 per person per day. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The pilot was tested in a small town in eatern DRC who production of waste, The sample size should be increased to take into account a town that has a vast population like kinshasa or Lubumbashi. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

5 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

$19,100

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The methodology will be transferred to local governments and the ministry of environment so they can discover what works, The next stage would to test this as a pilot in a bigger town such as Kinshasa

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The experiment was planned to be scaled into other towns but this required engagement

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The synergy between all the players involved at different levels of the plastic waste value chain and the  participatory approach facilitated the implementation of activities, helped avoid conflicts of interest between   different project leaders and circumvented political, economic, social and environmental constraints.

The experiment demonstrated that plastic waste represents an employment opportunity for many     unemployed people and a means of cleaning up the city of Bukavu, protecting diversity and preventing   flooding.

The city of Bukavu urgently needs a public landfill site to accommodate the solid waste value chain in general, and plastic waste in particular. At present, the city can no longer afford one, due to the over-urbanization of all available sites.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Cumbersome administrative procedures at the municipality of Bukavu, Impassable roads especially during the rain season making it difficult to access to certain collection, sorting and processing sites.

Recourse to artisanal methods of processing the plastic due to lack of machinery for sorting (separation of biodegradable waste, iron, plastics and glass) and materials, lack of machinery for compression of sorted waste and processing of plastic waste.

Lack of an uninhabited area outside the city of Bukavu for storing collected plastic waste, sorting it and transforming it into paving stones.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The  Inclusive growth, Environment programmatic area, because they have projects directly related to the implementation of environmental public policies and Youth Engagement. All the other programmatic areas for the use of experimental methodologies. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Public Institutions more specically The ministry of environment and local governments, Public infrastructure projects must take into consideration the paving stone production project as a means of eliminating plastic waste, making the city cleaner and preserving the environment;.  Residents and Entreprenuers from Bukavu  who had a chance to participate and interact with municipality on the importance of managing waste, cleaning the city while providing employment

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes other iterations included collective intelligence sessions for buiding a roadmap

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

- Several types of plastic waste are necessary for better quality paving stones;

- Plastic waste must be delivered to the processing site well before the start of the production process;

- To make good pavers, plastic waste must be heterogeneous: bottles, cans, bags and sorted at the collection stage to separate it from metals, biodegradables, etc.

-A steering team is needed to ensure that work proceeds smoothly in all phases, that it is carried out on time and, above all, that certain problems expressed by teams are resolved.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

yes SDG 12 on responsible production and consumption, Unsustainable patterns of consumption and production are root causes of the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Arrival to the hypothesis was a direct outcome of exploration and mapping

> What surprised you?

That there were already actors who were already transforming plastic into reusable items and needed to be brought into the limelight.
