> Description of the solution

The Pearl Academy in Jaipur, India uses water and traditional design for cooling. The building includes a sunken courtyard pool, which architect Manit Rastogi explains functions similarly to a basement, staying cooler than the above ground air in the summer and warmer in the winter, breezes flowing under the raised building create evaporative cooling currents that push air up through atria and open stair wells. The building also features an exterior latticed screen (Jaali) enveloping the building and provides a thermal buffer for buldings. The academy is constructed using a mix of local stone, steel, glass and concrete, keeping in mind the climatic needs of the region while retaining the progressive design intent. With energy efficiency being a prime concern, the institute is 100% self-sufficient in terms of captive power and water supply, and promotes rainwater harvesting and wastewater re-cycling through the use of a sewage treatment plant.
