Overall goal: Address surface waterbodies eutrophication in relation to their catchment, different water uses and the Cianosemáforo (Cyanosignal), as a tool for preventing risks in recreational waters Specific goals: 

• Systematize and share the knowledge gathered from applied research during the monitoring of water quality. 

• Raise awareness in society on the impact of the issue of eutrophication, cyanobacteria and their consequences on health.

• Promote visual monitoring of waterbodies through citizen participation.

• Establish partnerships and create contact networks among stakeholders. 

Description of citizen participation: Citizens participate in workshops, visual monitoring, data interpretation and communication. The Spanish acronym stands for the following:

· Control: Monitoring of cyanobacteria and other ELM water quality aspects, with systematized measures and adequate space-time resolution

· Y (and): The nexus involving citizens, research teaching staff, and students of FCEFyN-UNC.

· Alert(alert): After processing field data, supplemented with lab data, the risk levels associated to cyanobacteria exposure are informed to schools, decision-makers, and society.

· Niveles (levels): A risk level is assigned, and recommendations are made for different water uses.

· Observados (observed): Personnel from the Search and Rescue Group of Calamuchita and citizens perform visual monitoring at ELM.
