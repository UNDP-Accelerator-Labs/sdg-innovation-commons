> Title of the innovation

M.N Hatcheries and Incubation services

> Brief description of the innovation

I started my passion for Village chickens during the covid pandemic and the time I was starting I had 27 chickens but now I have more that 400 chickens and I am able to sell 10 trays of village eggs per week.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My business will grow in the next one or two years . At the moment at using a small incubator with a 66 egg capacity. My goal is to have a big incubator with a capacity of a thousand eggs which in turn will give me 1000 chicks in a month. My target market is the supermarket because I have made a research and discovered that most super markets don't sell village chicken s and village eggs. If the business grows it will add value in that youths and women in my society will be empowered to have their own food and also make a profit .

> Technical Feasibility

At the moment the business has no prototype so to say . And at the moment the innovation has already started and only aiming to buy a big incubator

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will help the youths and women in the society in that they will be empowered with chicks and feed to start their own business and in the long run eliminate poverty levels.
