## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Digital nomadism is a key trend in tourism and work, and there is a need to continue doing research

2. Digital nomads can be an important contributing demographic to tourism

3. Digital nomads are still an untapped pool of a diverse range of human capital skills

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Although this work is still in its infancy, we have been working with a municipality in one of the country's top destinations for digital nomads


## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The data collected and used contribute to a deeper and more thorough understanding of the learning question.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Because all of these methods are part of the AccLab's portfolio of working methods and they were useful to get the project moving.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Our learning question/frontier challenge is an emerging theme where digital technology play a key role. Innovative methods are needed in order to approach the theme from a more flexible standpoint than using traditional research and project design methods.



> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
