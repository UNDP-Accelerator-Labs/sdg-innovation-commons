> Title of the innovation

Solar Generation ON Student Performance

> Brief description of the innovation

In this educational initiative , suggestions will be made on to build a real model of solar village inside educational institutions which uses only solar energy. The innovation examine  the educational , social and scientific impact on student performance.The execution of the innovation inside the educational institution promotes creativity and thinking ability among student

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With electricity price expected to rise over the coming years  private and public educational institution owners are searching for ways to save utility bills . Therefore the market is readily available.

> Technical Feasibility

The plan is as follows the information on solar energy uses ,solar panel types and their performance and also  the type of photo voltaic cell  will be collected .Then input cost of installing solar panels  will be calculated to see how much capital will be needed and the last stage of implantation is estimating the load of the campus and  see to it that solar energy generated will be enough to outway the demand of electricity  on campus.

> Anticipated Social Impact

JOB
Solar energy generation is becoming common everyday and people have started investing in solar energy.They hire people for managing and installation, therefore will create jobs for others people.
SAFE TO THE ENVIRONMENT
Fossil fuel and caol pollute air and water . Generating energy from them is like killing your self slowly and increases global warming but with solar energy makes quality of air better. 
ECONOMIC
When we use solar energy ,we have to pay  exactly what we use.means that educational owner won't spending money nothing they have not used . this will allow them to employ other workers.This will boost up the country economy.
CHEAPER
Solar energy is quite cheeper than oil or any other source .there is easy install.
