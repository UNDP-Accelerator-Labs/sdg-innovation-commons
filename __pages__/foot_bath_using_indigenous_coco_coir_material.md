> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

In response to the national, even worldwide, call for control/prevention of the spread COVID19 pandemic, the DOSCST prepared a Foot Bath made of coco coir, which is an indigenous material readily available in the locality. The coir is sprayed with a chemical as disinfectant. This is placed at the entrance Gate that will disinfect the shoes/wheels of anyone (persons) or anything (vehicles) entering the school premises.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

This solution (Coco coir foot bath) answers the challenge to immediately support the prevention if not eradication of the virus spread at a very minimal cost as much as possible. There no need for constant refilling of the chemical because the coir is capable of holding the solution for quite a long time.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

This is for the faculty, staff, students, and guests entering the school premises. This solution is user-friendly because of the capacity of the coco coir to hold the water intact while giving just enough disinfection needed for both humans and vehicles. This means lesser hassle to the users - no shoes are overly immersed in the disinfectant, thus avoiding wet sandals or feet without jeopardizing the OOTD (outfit-of-the-day/footwear) of the user. 

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

I found this solution worth-emulating because it is both cost efficient and user-freindly. It is wise to use indigenous materials that can be friendly to nature as well.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

This solution can also be applied not only in the academe but also in other institutions: supermarkets, wet markets, hospitals, and other public places.
