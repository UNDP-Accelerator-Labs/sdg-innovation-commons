> Brief description of the innovation

We recycle glass products (bottles, mirrors etc) to make cullet which is used as a substitute to sand to make concrete products (countertops, pavers, blocks etc)

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With the increase in construction we looking to B2B2C. Contractors are our biggest targets as it will allow our B2C clients to have a look at our products at no costs before purchase. We are also looking to charge bars a minimal monthly subscription fee for bottle collection. The prize will market our product and help seek audience with government officials to help share awareness to the public

> Technical Feasibility

We are mainly collect bottles from bars and crush them to make cullet which is later used to make concrete products depending on the client. We currently looking to increase bottle collection and marketing to increase the number of clients and range of concrete products on sale

> Anticipated Social Impact

With the high levels of construction. Sand demand has immensely increased as such we are looking to reduce deforestation by providing a substitute and encouraging "keep Zambia clean" by recycling glass. Which will help reduce disease such as cholera
