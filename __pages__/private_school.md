> Title of the innovation

Private school

> Brief description of the innovation

I intent to open a school that can provide good quality education using a holistic approach, a school that can train a child to be able to coordinate hands, head and heart which will incorporate extra curricular activities such as music and art, as well as agriculture.
I understand that music is an important part in a every child for it brings in creativity, coordination and confidence in every child through group and individual performances (recitals). 
In our growing economy towards agriculture, we want to introduce agriculture as a business in fun way (rearing of animals, horticulture, floriculture and cash crop production).

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As a private school we will be able to raise our income through school fees and sell of products from the agricultural department, which will also help sponsor vulnerable kids in our society for they also need this kind of high quality education.
This will also benefit the other youths through employment as teachers, general works and others in administration.
Mumbwa is a growing town and alot of people are coming in from developed towns but they can't find good schools that can not only challenge their children's IQs but also be exciting. For me this is an opportunity to bring in a school that can bring out the best in a child.
The value school adds value in the Mumbwa education sector.

> Technical Feasibility

Procure a big piece of land that can accommodate modern learning facilities, agricultural fields and sports facilities.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Many qualified youths and disabled people will be employment and enrolled hence improving their lives and also help in the right against drug abuse and early marriages through education. This will in turn empower the children and the community at larg.
