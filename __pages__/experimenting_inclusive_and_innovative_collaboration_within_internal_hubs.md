## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Experimenting inclusive and innovative collaboration within internal hubs 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is how we might enhance knowledge-creating and share as well as create a mindset change about the value of knowledge through experimenting and providing a variety of tools and platforms can we provide to increase collaboration and networking among teams in the CO. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Organizational culture is a collective and common set of values, beliefs, assumptions, and ways of interaction that contribute to the unique social and psychological environment of an organization. It is “the way things are done around here”. The accelerator lab is part of a new way of working for UNDP to bring innovation into how we identify, understand, and solve challenges. This new way of working requires a shift in our culture when it comes to how we create, share and manage knowledge. Recognizing this, UNDP Ethiopia is creating open, innovative, networked, and collaborative programs anchored in a portfolio approach to inclusive economic growth, climate resilience, and democratic governance. To spearhead this approach, the lab set out to experiment with knowledge creation and sharing culture as the basis for the knowledge management project in the country office. 

Along the same lines, the Country office underwent a reconfiguration of its policy and program management in Q1 of 2021 to remain ‘fit-for-purpose’ as a key development partner and achieve the new CPD (2020-2025) by raising the scale, quality, and impact of results achieved and the efficiency with which resources are deployed. Structurally, this is achieved through the creation of hubs/networks around priority areas of the CPD and practically, it is by creating “a much more open, innovative, collaborative, and networked approach” to programmatic work. However, on the day-to-day level, there is still the question of how to achieve this. The lab set out to learn how our office creates and shares knowledge as a means for fostering collaboration and innovation to enhance knowledge-creating and share as well as create a mindset change about the value of knowledge through experimenting and providing a variety of tools and platforms can we provide to increase collaboration and networking among teams in the CO?

With the new Configuration, there is a lot of question on how the hubs are exceptive to work together and how projects within the hub are to create links between their areas to make a systemic impact. Looking at an existing staff perception survey to get an understanding of the innovation and collaboration culture in the office, we found out that the value of innovation is understood but there are challenges to bringing it into practice such as being risk-averse, fear of failure, and not feeling empowered to try new ways of working. Looking to the future, as an organization, we are building an open, innovative, networked, and collaborative work environment. However, what does that mean on a day-to-day basis? From our exploration of the desires of senior management, we saw that they are looking to have a motivated and passionate team that regularly interacts with each other and works together to learn new things through experimentation.  We now understand that while there is a common acceptance and understanding of what we need to do conceptually, there needs to be a cultural change in how we value and express knowledge. We need to have a structured way of integrating our work and sharing what we are learning. This means we need to have scalable solutions that can simultaneously bring mindset change as well as change the way we work.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There is knowledge and understanding on the value of knowledge sharing as a means for collaboration and innovating in the CO.  The reconfiguration of the program unit at beginning of 2021 was to have a more open and networked working environment, however, because of the way we value knowledge in the workstream and the lack of dedicated activities behind it, changing mindsets and the day to day working environment has been challenging. This is where experimenting with different solutions and integrating innovative tools like behavioral insight which the lab is so well versed has come in handy. While the lab has taken the initiative to explore this topic initially, the CO teams are now turning to us to guide and support the development and execution of the knowledge management road map and integrated planning activities. The lab is bringing the experience of designing experiments, tools, and methodologies that are unique within the CO.

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

On the last exercise the lab team led a sensemaking exercise to know what the current culture within the organization is and to work together.  Following this we are planning to do an experiment different solution through identifying them using co-creation and participatory design to understand on how might access to a cross-portfolio and project knowledge encourage staff to share knowledge and create shared objectives and goals. 

The lab team also plans to test different engagement tools which will help create synergy and improve staff collaboration through human center design and design thinking methods. 

Though collective intelligence of the staffs we plan also to identify an agile platform for capturing knowledge, documentation and sharing allow staff to create and share learnings more frequently 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

User journey and observe the staff's behavior as well engaging them on different focuses group discussion and interviews on how they use different engagement tools which will help create cooperation and improve staff collaboration through tracking data and system mapping will help us to the identified an agile platform for capturing knowledge, documentation and sharing allow staff to create and share learnings more frequently. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

UNDP in Ethiopia has undergone organisational structural reconfiguration to function in better connected and collaborative way as a development organisation in a continuously changing environment and to focus on delivering Country Programme results through efficient and effective utilisation of resources. The CO has thus undertaken a Portfolio approach to Programming which focuses on system-wide collaboration and partnerships among CO staff, partners and stakeholders; continuous use of policy data and research to inform Programming as well as information sharing to keep stakeholders involved and updated on on-going development efforts. Therefore, learnings from this exercise will contribute to this CO effort and will provide inputs for CO Knowledge Management Action plan and toolkit.
