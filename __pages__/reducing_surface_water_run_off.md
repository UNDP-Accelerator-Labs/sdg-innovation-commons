> Description of the solution

Detroit-based Parjana Distribution LLC is partnering with Lawrence Technological University (LTU) on a pilot project that involves testing a new stormwater drainage system for parking lots that is expected to significantly reduce stormwater runoff volumes. The technology, named energy-passive groundwater recharge products (EGRPs), includes 31.75mm-diameter hydrophobic, polyethylene tubes composed of five chambers and open channels along edges. Designed to handle up to an inch of rain (25mm) during a 24- hour period, EGRPs facilitate underground water recharge by balancing soil moisture and promoting movement of water between horizontal soil layers.EGRP can be used to improve drainage to infiltrate standing water, manage soil moisture to protect underground infrastructure, or recharge water depleted soils to replenish wells and rejuvenate rivers.

The pilot project is slated for a series of demonstrations in partnership with universities in Ohio, Washington D.C, Carlifonia and Florida
