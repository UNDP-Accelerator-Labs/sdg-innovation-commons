> Title of the innovation

Ngombe Compound crafts youth innovation

> Brief description of the innovation

The youth innovation was borne after seeing the potential that youths have to weave different things like shoe's, door mats, baskets and many other things. It drew my attention to try and bring them together and see how they can be empowered and rich the better highest. As at now they are well equipped with different skills and knowledge such that they are ready to compete at National and regional level. For more information we are more than willing to come and exhibit our talents and skills and with your help many graduates and school leavers who are wallowing in poverty will be helped to escape this grip of poverty. The pictures have failed to be loaded but we are more than willing to come with them for more clarity if we pull through.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate income by selling our most beautiful arts to many stakeholders across the Nation and at region level. With these incomes we have many other youths to help who know for example how to do haircut and different hairstyles in the same compound. Currently, our targets are members of the community, and other well wishers who give us opportunity to weave for them different things that they want such as door mats, shoes and hats of different types according to what they want us to make for them. With the help of this innovation many youths have been empowered with income generation skills which have prevented them from staying in the street to beg for money but they are innovative and some of them are soon going to be self_reliance. For those who are bread winners after selling these good, 40 percent is given to them so that they help their families and three are being helped interms if school fees and other school necessities.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently, we don't have any prototype but we are planning to partner with the ministry of labour, commerce and trades and ministry of tourism so that our innovation s may be known at National level. The proposed implementation plan for this innovation is 5 years. In this plan we want to have 1000 youths are being empowered with this skills that will reduce dependency syndrome among the youths in the community. Furthermore, we have identified Chikumbuso organization in the area that we want to partner with for networking purposes. It has two graduates with degrees one in Social work and other one in demography and economics.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation has been impacting lives of others by helping them go to school which has resulted in those bread winners being role model in the families. Furthermore, when incomes are enough we are planning to start a old and physically challenged care center that will help to address the under researched part in our country and help to add to the existing board of knowledge in the country. This innovation is relevant to the existing market in the sense that we are able to compete with other at National and regional level in issues to do with crafts.
