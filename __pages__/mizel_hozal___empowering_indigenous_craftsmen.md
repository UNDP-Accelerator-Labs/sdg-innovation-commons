"mizel-hozal" - a Chakma word for "blending" - is a fashion house by indigenous minorities of Bangladesh. It blends & fuses different styles, techniques and available raw-materials in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) and around the world.  It is collaborating with Supporting People and Rebuilding Communities (SPaRC), the youth and women led organisation which is working towards safeguarding diversity, dignity of individuals and aiming to contribute in making a better world. SPaRC is presently working with the survivors of violence against women (VAW) in CHT. Some of the violence against women (VAW) survivors take active parts in preparing mizel-hozal's products. Collaboration between SPARC and ''mizel-hozal" through sharing the survivors' talents of craftsmanship with the profit sharing initiation will help both the survivors of VAW in CHT and "mizel-hozal".
