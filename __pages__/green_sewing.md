Green Sewing is a socio-environmental startup that aims to recycling tarpaulin advertising posters into products unique creative and eco-friendly (Shopping bag, Pencil case,backpacks ...). The project responds to the problem identified, namely the absence of promotion and use of advertising posters (tarpaulins) after their expiration, and the lack of sustainable alternatives. Our environmental impact is manifested in the fact that we give a second life to a material at the end of the cycle to produce new reusable and sustainable products to encourage people to stop using plastic bags for a single use, on the other hand we help housewives and low-income women by ensuring them a job and a salary.  https://web.facebook.com/Green.sewing.4/videos/1093601367745275
