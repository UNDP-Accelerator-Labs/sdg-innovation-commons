> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



In Palestine, amidst the complex and volatile political situation imposed by the occupation including the ongoing war on Gaza, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are facing significant challenges in sustaining their operations to support inclusive community resilience and assist the most disadvantaged groups. International funding for Palestinians has historically played a pivotal role in supporting these institutions and ensuring the continuity of their services to Palestinian society. However, over the past decade, there has been a systemic and significant decline in

international aid to the Palestinian government and people, affecting the operations of many Palestinian grassroots organizations.

Simultaneously, there is an undeniable trend of excessive reliance on international aid, which has led to overlooking other potential local funding sources for community initiatives spearheaded by these organizations. This oversight exacerbates the deficit in governmental and international aid to these organizations.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Historically, charitable giving has been a crucial component of social solidarity, ingrained in the social values and embraced by local communities in response to the challenges they face, particularly impacting the most vulnerable segments of these communities. During these difficult times, it has become imperative to strengthen the collective community-based support to assist NGOs in realizing their goals. The widespread use of credit cards and, more recently, electronic wallets may provide an opportunity and means to streamline the process of charitable giving and enhance the level of accountability and transparency in collecting, channeling and fund utilization as well as fostering trust and attracting more people to donate through this mechanism. 

One innovative approach to address this is Round-Up Financing, a mechanism that leverages microtransactions to accumulate funds for charitable causes. Round-Up Financing collects small donations by rounding up transactions to the nearest whole number. With fintech platforms and mobile applications, users can opt-in to donate their spare change from everyday transactions to charitable causes. This model has gained traction globally for its simplicity, convenience, and potential to accumulate substantial funds over time.

Beginning in 2013, budget support to the PA started to decline. International assistance to the Palestinian people has been provided in the form of humanitarian assistance, project funding, and development lending that are also shrinking over time.

The expansion of digital financial services including e-wallets and online banking utilized by 15.1% of the population highlights a growing acceptance and utilization of modern financial tools. There was a substantial increase in the adult population having mobile money to 14% by 2021. According to Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) statistics on financial inclusion, 50% of people aged 15+ have bank accounts and 21% have debit cards.

Given the unprecedented destruction and socio-economic impact of the Gaza war in the State of Palestine, it is evident that traditional funding from donors will not be sufficient to address the extensive demands and investments required for early recovery and reconstruction. There is a need to consider alternative financing mechanisms established and institutionalized by the Palestinian people to mitigate the impact of the dynamic and volatile political situation on the availability of resources for development in the State of Palestine. Additionally, amidst the urgency of crisis and its differentiated impact on Palestinians, it is critical to protect and enhance social cohesion. Round-up donations could be one solution to facilitate solidarity among Palestinians and overcome challenges related to movement and outreach, thus enabling support for the most marginalized and affected segments and communities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



 The Accelerator Lab is committed to assisting the CO in exploring various viable alternatives for financing. The CO has been approached by unconventional partners, including the Palestine Investment Fund, to collaborate on establishing alternative impact financing mechanisms. Additionally, the CO is keen on strengthen the resilience of the financial sector in the State of Palestine and integrating new technological solutions to improve access to finance and funding opportunities for individuals and institutions.

Among the many options to be explored in this multifaceted endeavor, round-up financing stands out as a promising avenue to enhance and streamline community engagement in recovery and development efforts and reducing dependency on international aid.

We aim to assess citizens' perceptions and interest in utilizing a digital round-up financing to contribute to the social causes and organizations they desire to support. Furthermore, we plan to facilitate design thinking studios with banks and NGOs to develop the most suitable model customized for the Palestinian context. This model will carefully consider restrictions and regulatory challenges to ensure efficient operationalization, sustainability, and transparency.

Initiate the pilot phase of the co-created round-up financing model with three banks and a minimum of five organizations. Following the successful completion and validation of the initial pilot, the growth phase will involve expanding the pilot program to encompass all 13 banks operating in Palestine with support from the Palestine Monetary Authority. Additionally, during this phase, efforts will be made to involve more NGOs, thus fostering broader participation and impact within the community.
