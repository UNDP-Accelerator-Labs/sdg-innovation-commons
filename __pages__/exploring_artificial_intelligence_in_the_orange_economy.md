Exploring Artificial Intelligence in the Orange Economy 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that AI presents many potential pitfalls and concerns in the Caribbean arts and heritage sector if not understand and applied responsibly. Conversely, if better understood and used with care, AI can present many opportunities for growth in the Orange Economy.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



AI has significantly upended the creative sector in recent years, with many artists concerned that it is compromising vital elements of creativity, included through job loss and loss of intellectual property rights amongst other issue areas. This is driven by the rapid rise of AI and resulting misuse and misunderstanding around it. This involves actors such as artists, archivists, curators, copyright lawyers, archaeologists, film/tv producers, actors and more. Currently, many persons involved in the Orange Economy in the Caribbean are apprehensive about AI's impact on the sector, with the resulting undesired effect of persons not embracing AI for good.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Our Accelerator Lab will leverage its convening power and ability to craft innovation journeys by hosting a Symposium on AI in Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. This Symposium will bring together expert panelists before local community members for discuss on subjects such as human rights and access of A.I. in Caribbean arts and heritage, gender &amp; LGBTQIA+ in heritage interpretation through digital technologies, the implications of AI in film and TV, digital technologies and intangible cultural heritage, copyright law in the age of AI nad more. Our Lab needs to work on this challenge based on its unique focus on R&amp;D for sustainable develop and, as AI is an emerging focus in the creative sphere, there is a gap we can fill in terms of generating understanding of the responsible use of AI in the creative sector, which is not widely understood. It is worth investing resources to this challenge as the creative economy represents immense potential as a source of economic growth and diversification in the Caribbean.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



The Acc Lab for BBD &amp; EC will be posting a Symposium on AI in Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage, discussing its many opportunities and challenges in the creative sector.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We want to understand how AI can be responsibly applied to the creative sector in ways that boost the Caribbean Orange Economy.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



By hosting an AI Symposium on Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage, we will be engaging key local stakeholders in an innovative manner, leveraging our art of hosting skills and techniques. This will help to weave communities together within the topic of AI, creating potential for partnership and knowledge generation. We will also be exploring the theme of AI in the creative sector, exploring the edges of its potential and pitfalls that are only just starting to appear. This will involve future forecasting and analysis, providing projections of what we anticipate from AI in creative spaces, both globally and regionally.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



By engaging with communities and relevant stakeholders in the digital x Orange Economy space, we will try to fill the many information gaps that exist, such as how many Caribbean persons are actually applying AI to creative work currently. We will also try to gauge sentiment towards AI, measuring how Caribbean persons feel about AI in the context of creativity. We will look to AI itself for some of these answers as well, as well as how AI represents Caribbean iconography and analyzing its benefits and drawbacks. 
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Other SIDS/RBLAC colleagues and teams can benefit from exploration of this challenge. We can collaborate in our regional with tech bodies, academia and cultural institutions.
