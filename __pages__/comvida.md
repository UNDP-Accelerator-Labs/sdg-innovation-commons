Facing the country's emergency situation and taking into account our mission, with a focus on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, it was up to UNDP, within the Accelerator Lab Project, with a view to acting more quickly in the most diverse and complex challenges, understand the difficulties and support opportunities that the Government and the Country need, using modern technology and techniques for modeling processes and modern tools that are easy for everyone to use. Thus, COMVIDA appears, a technological solution composed of several modules and that works in an integrated way with all institutions throughout the cycle of combating COVID19.It is the main channel of communication with the citizen during the pandemic crisis (Government's official communication channel for the pandemic crisis).
