> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This is a poultry project specifically designed for eggs production. It is planned to start with 400 layer birds in 4 batches of 100 birds in each batch. It is assumed that only 85% production shall be realized, which means 400 trays of eggs shall be realized and incubated in the first 30 days of our project which provides sustenance of our project. The primary customers for the eggs shall be prominent egg traders within Isoka municipalty. The minor customers shall be the egg venders who usually boil 10 to 15 trays of eggs and vend it at pubs, market places and streets. The reason for the target market is that egg production in Isoka  cannot meet market demands. The project is a three-fold strategy, in that it seeks to create a viable income generation project for our initiative, giving it an alternate way to support its daily activities and to improve the welfare of the the Youth in the community and the district at large. The project will produce poultry products for sale  and the proceeds will not only assist the youths who are directly involved to meet the basic necessities of life but also the community members at large. Winning this prize will have a tremendous impact on us as it will serve as a starting backup capital for our initiative which has the potential to serve many lives in our rural community.

> Technical Feasibility

In order to successfully implement this new innovation in our community, there is need for adequate financial support to give us the initial capital inputs which includes; birds, feed and an incubator. To show how committed and passionate we are about reducing the poverty levels in our community we have already purchased a 440 egg incubator capacity, drinkers and feeders.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project will see a lot of families out of poverty through job creation and empowerment programs which in turn will play a tremendous impact in creating a thriving community as poultry farming is one of the major sources of generating income.
