> Brief description of the innovation

Currently there are thousands of trained graduates, in Zambia, who are not employed and have been waiting to be employed as employees without knowing when they will be employed. This is after spending years of schooling up to tertiary education with minds conditioned to being employees. The reason is that most parents and other leaders including teachers have not told these graduates the story that they were born employers- that there are employers in each of them. Given that the young people were told the Employee in them Story without the Employer in them Story, the majority of the graduates get stranded when they are not employed as employees.
    Despite this challenge, there is one of  the solutions  in form of The Employer in them Story dubbed "The employer in You Story" designed to be told. It tells the Untold Story particularly to  the youngones, that they were born employers and that they can develop  products and services which they end up  owning and sell to the market as owners who are employers. But this mindset is not in most of most youngones. This is the mindset this initiative aims to inculcate in the youngones in particular

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The initiative has both the business aspect of selling the media products and services .Supply of books, videos, audios and other designed materials to corporate and Government instutions like the Ministry of General Education, as major buyers for sale to generate income. These can in turn be distributed into schools and other community setups as change media content by the buyers. The initiative further may be contracted by Government and the Corporate world to engage in wealth creation, wealth building, wealth ownership and wealth distribution Empowerment Programmes for their clientele. For example series 1  is approved  by MOGE. If we get demand for say  20,000 books @ k100 revenue OF K2, 000,000.Enhanced capacity for  business  leadership, entrepreneurship  and business  management  will add value to existing businesses  through human capital  personal  development  . This has a spiilover effect in the value chain.This will empower business leaders,entreprenuers and business mangers to enhance theiir business. Impact on the environment will be negligent given  that the innovation  is predominantly knowledge  based using existing  technology  like computers and other equipment that are environmentally friendly. The major physical products will be hardcopies and other materials  and brochures printed on paper whose environmental  impact is negligible .

> Technical Feasibility

Using the crafted a wealth creation and acquisition/ ownership/ accumulation equation as a basis for wealth creation and ownership:

WEALTH CREATIIN AND ACQUISITION = HUMAN CAPITAL + SOCIAL CAPITAL + RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS + PEOPLE AROUND YOU + YOUR EXPERIENCE+ TIME +RESOURCE MIX + PACKAGING + BRANDING + MARKETING + SALES
BASED ON THE FIVE PILLARS OF WEALTH CRAFTED BY SIMON KAYEKESI, NAMELY WEALTH CREATION, WEALTH BUILDING, WEALTH ESTABLISHING, WEALTH OWNERSHIP AND WEALTH DISTRIBUTION THE EMPLOYER IN YOU INITIATIVE IS A WEALTH GENERATING PROGRAMME TO BENEFIT THE BUSINESS UNDERTAKING AND OTHER OFF TAKERS IN THE MEDIA VALUE CHAIN AND IMPACTING OTHER VALUE CHAINS SUCH AS AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY.
USING THE MEDIA EQUATION CRAFTED BY SIMON MBUYI KAYEKESI: MEDIA= PLATFORM + CONTENT = COMMUNITY IMPACT, THE INITIATIVE IS A TWO PRONE PRODUCT APPROACH TO MEDIA BUSINESS FOCUSING ON BOTH CONTENT PRODUCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF PLATFORMS FOR TRANSMITT IT NG TRANSFORMATIVE INFORMATION.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There is a problem or a challenge that many countries are grappling with globally and nationally when it comes to employment. Many countries including Zambia are faced with high unemployment with no hope or little hope for employment of the young ones in particular. For example, in Zambia there are many young ones who are graduates from learning institutions who after graduating at various levels have no jobs because they were only taught one route to be employers instead of being  employers.
    Given that the young people were told the Employee in them Story without the Employer in them story, the majority of the graduates get stranded when they are not employed as employees. However, the Employer in them Story tells the youngones that they were born employers and that they can develop  products and services which they own and sell to the market as owners who are employers. But this mindset is not in most of our youngones. To make matters worse, it is not even in most parents, teachers and other leaders. Whenever most leaders talk about employment, they refer to employee- employment and nothing or very little reference to employer- employment. This poses a big challenge to a nation like
     Zambia has a very high supply of labour and  low demand for labour because of lack of job opportunities for most graduates in a number of skills.
    The employer in you Insights are about changing the mindset of our communities regarding the idea of employment. These achored on the philosophy that when you change the minds of the nationals of a given country, you transform in nation. The Employer in You  is a transformative initiative that aims to change the mindset of nationals to realize the employers that they were born to be.
     This inititaitve aims to raise millionaire young entrepreneours who will be a blessing to the community in which they are found through capacity building and mentoring youths to establish innovative  entrepreneurial setups. It is predominantly, a capacity building and  mentorship initiative for wealth creation, wealth building, wealth establishing, wealth ownership and wealth distribution to communities. This is from a backdrop of Zambia on one hand being endowed with  reservours of various resources as its potential wealth while on the other hand,  there is high poverty levels among the citizenry which is compounded by high unemployment.It is also predominantly  knowledge, wisdom and understanding based innovation that prioritizes the three to be a foundation for acquiring wealth and distributing it. the three, knowledge, wisdom and understanding used as ingredients for business leadership, entrepreneurship and business management if desimmented and applied can result in wealth creation, wealth ownership and wealth distribution In communities.
     The tangibility of this initiative is that it  is focussed on business bookwriting , song composition, business poems writing, business drama, business music  and thier  publication and distribution,  motivation and  trainings and capacity building programmes  using the same books and other innovative  materials. this focuses on media products and services that are transformative in nature. these products &amp; services range from mindset change ( paradigm shift) products  to products for realization of the potential capital in individuals and around individuals. the focus is on recognizing and identifying our potential capital and engaging in actions that  translate such potential capital into cash and result in wealth creation and ownership for distribution. to this effect simon mbuyi kayekesi has crafted a wealth creation and acquisition/ ownership/ accumulation equation as a basis for wealth creation and ownership as follows:

WEALTH CREATIIN AND ACQUISITION = HUMAN CAPITAL + SOCIAL CAPITAL + RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS + PEOPLE AROUND YOU + YOUR EXPERIENCE+ TIME +RESOURCE MIX + PACKAGING + BRANDING + MARKETING + SALES
    BASED ON THE FIVE PILLARS OF WEALTH CRAFTED BY SIMON MBUYI KAYEKESI, NAMELY WEALTH CREATION, WEALTH BUILDING, WEALTH ESTABLISHING, WEALTH OWNERSHIP AND WEALTH DISTRIBUTION THE EMPLOYER IN YOU INITIATIVE IS A WEALTH GENERATING PROGRAMME TO BENEFIT THE BUSINESS UNDERTAKING AND OTHER OFF TAKERS IN THE MEDIA VALUE CHAIN AND IMPACTING OTHER  VALUE CHAINS SUCH AS  AGRICULTURE, EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY.
    USING THE  MEDIA EQUATION CRAFTED  BY SIMON MBUYI KAYEKESI: MEDIA= PLATFORM + CONTENT = COMMUNITY IMPACT, THE INITIATIVE IS A TWO PRONE PRODUCT APPROACH TO MEDIA BUSINESS FOCUSING ON BOTH CONTENT PRODUCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF  PLATFORMS FOR TRANSMITT IT NG TRANSFORMATIVE CONTENT DISTRIBUTION.
   From The Employer  Insights Book Writing, video and audio material Production to book, video and audio distribution into schools,tertiary institutions, youth skills training centres and the community at large to offering, motivation talks,  training and capacity building in Business Leadership, Entrepreneurship and Business Management to youths in particular; offer designed Entrepreneurship programmes on radio and Television; Print media, social media, virtual and physical platforms. The initiative plans procure bigger  printing machines,studio equipment such as  cameras, computers, recorders  
for production of Entrepreneurship, Business Leadership  and Business Management for Distribution to Institutions of learning and the community at large as a one of the Media for mindset change.
    The initiative aims at training  and mentoring youths into engaging in various Product Development, Marketing and Sales initistived such as book writing and publication, music writing, composing and production, poems writing and production into books and  poem . Other than using existing platforms like Youtube and Facebook, the initiative aims to collaborate with existing Radio and Television Stations as well us establshing  radio and television stations mainly for delivering  transformative media for media for mindset change ( paradigm shift) of the Zambian people in general and in particular the people of North Western Province. These activities will be undertaken in Northwestern Province with Solwezi as a springboard but extending to other provinces of Zambia given that the innovation is national, continental and global in nature. The initiative will encompass products in the media value chain with forward and backward linkages.   The initiative will have a spectrum from product development to marketing and selling the transformative products to consumers.
  The initiative has both the business aspect of selling the media products and services but also has a corporate social responsibility aspect where empowerment programmes and materials  are dustributed and availed  to widows, orphans and vulnerable children in form of corporate social responsibility.

The innovation  will also, apart from printing  hard copies, use environmentally  friendly distribution  of products such as E-books and provide soft copies to reduce on the use of paper and other printing materials.This will minimize impact on the environment.
The initiative has a high probability of success provided the innovation  receives the expected demand from Government  and those expected corporate entities who are envisaged to procure the bulk of The Employer in You estimated number of books and other services to be supplied on demand.
