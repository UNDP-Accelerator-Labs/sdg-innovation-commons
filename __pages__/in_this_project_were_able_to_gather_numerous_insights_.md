## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

In this project were able to gather numerous insights: 1) The importance of working with multiple stakeholders: The project involved our sister agency UNICEF and many other including government research agencies and departments. The engagement enabled sharing of resources and technical capabilities 2) The innovation challenge modality yields high visibility compared to many other approaches. 3) It is crucial to egage government from the inception phase of the project, this will yield buy- in and support. 4) Two UN agencies working together has proved that we can leverage our capabilities and also increase impact of our initiatives.
