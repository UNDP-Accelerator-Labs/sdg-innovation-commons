## Kondayama Biofuel produces ethanol cooking fuel from cassava and a ethanol cooking stove 

The lack of clean cooking energy solutions is a very big problem affecting Sierra Leone, from its origin to date. The country’s population depends on the use of dirty energy (firewood, charcoal and kerosene) to cook. Only 0.8% of the country’s population use clean cooking energy sources to cook. That is from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity. This problem has resulted in deforestation, contamination of the environment, air pollution, air borne diseases and health problems; and affects our climate, social life and the economy of the country.
