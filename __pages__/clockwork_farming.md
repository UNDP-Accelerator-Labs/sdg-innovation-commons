> Brief description of the innovation

clockwork is a farming website that offers unique calendar software to its customers. The calendars are unique because they give you a step by step procedure of what you are farming from start to finish. Through these calendars, the farmers data is given to interested parties like agro-chems and companies in the agriculture industry to get in touch with the customer. This is unique because now the business owners will be the ones engaging customers which will boost sales significantly. The website will also share farmer data with restaurants and interested parties that will be able to see which farmer has a ready product and call them directly.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This software has huge potential in generating income as big data is sold or auctioned to interested parties generating high incomes and sustainability. Companies that want to have a competitive edge will have no problem buying this data. Also charges applied in the marketplace when a ready product is sold.

> Technical Feasibility

Website hosting and dropbox membership are the biggest expenses that are paid yearly. The income generated should cater for this with plenty of money leftover to channel into marketing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This software has huge implications on the society because farmers will be able to sell or get interested parties calling them right when their products are ready even before. This increases sales. Businesses will also have better turn overs because they will be able to compete better by engaging the customer themselves rather than waiting. They will have a wider reach. Also entities that operate from home will work more efficiently with this type of data as there is no need to own a shop in town. Simply buy our data at a small fee and start calling!
