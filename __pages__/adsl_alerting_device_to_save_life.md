ADSL-Alerting Device to Save Life

> Brief description of the innovation

The ADSL is a plug-in module for all sorts of vehicles ranging from cars to mobile machinery and heavy equipment. ADSL stands for Alerting Device to Save Lives. The ADSL is a versatile tool that can be used in countless scenarios where safety is of prime importance. This module was designed to overcome most of all human error-induced accidents in places where mobile machines are used. Human limitations such as poor hearing in noisy environments, poor vision in dusty environments, and blind spots caused by obstruction by obstacles are just a few of the many causes of accidents in the workplace. The ADSL is an embedded computing system that has been equipped with enough computing power to detect the presence of another vehicle within a given proximity and to alert the machine operator or driver of a possible collision by means of an audible sound. It has also stereo intercepting system to priorities warning sound. Incase of breakdown along the way, it has warning emergency switch to warn other vehicles.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1.	To mitigate the road traffic and mine accidents and road sign pole vandalism.
2.	Our target is the ministry of mines and ministry of transport (individual vehicles through RTSA) both local and international.
3.	The supporting policies must be in place. 
4.	This safety feature must be included in the mine regulation guide book so that it becomes mandatory for all mining houses to have this device installed on all mobile mining equipment and vehicles.
5.	The device shall be sold to mining houses and replaced yearly.
6.	Labour hire to mine houses for maintenance of the garget on scheduled maintenance according to their service plan.
7.	It will be mandatory through Road Development Agency, and Road Transport and Safety Agency to pay a small service charge once daily by both local and international transporters on different rates for maintenance purposes for the electronic road sign recognition system.
8.	Installation charges on both company and individual vehicles.
9.	Training charges on individual Driver’s licence holder to be and prior to renewal at all RTSA stations.
10.	Zambia being a landlocked country most road transporters use it to reach neighbouring countries. Therefore, the introduction of the safety device installation and maintenance charge will bring in revenue.
11.	We intend to export the device which will bring in revenue.
12.	Sending of expatriates for installation, training and maintenance will bring in revenue.

> Technical Feasibility

1.	The invention relates to mitigating road traffic accidents by using powerful microcontrollers in conjunction with radio transceivers and speakers installed in off-road Heavy Mobile Equipment, on-road Vehicles, Locomotives, motorcycle, bicycle, road signage, and in the pouch of personnel to alert the driver of the specific road sign or vehicle in the given radius. This gives the driver an opportunity to act in good time and avoid accidents.
2.	It is a two part system a transmitter and a receiver circuit.

3.    Pending Patents for the device.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1.	The production process creates employment through the chain supply.
2.	Installation process creates direct employments 
3.	Maintenance process creates direct employment.
4.	Social responsibility from area of operation.
5.	With this device it grants 24hrs service operation on road safely 
6.	It is the smart way of reducing road sign pole vandalism because the system will be monitored 24 hrs
7.	The monitoring of the systems will create employment too.
8.	Sensitisation by trainers, Teachers will be our target hence creating employment for the teachers.
9.	Zambia being a landlocked country most road transporters use it to reach neighbouring countries. Therefore, the introduction of the safety device installation and maintenance charge will bring in revenue.
10.	We intend to export the device which will bring in revenue.
11.	Sending of expatriates for installation, training and maintenance will bring in revenue.
12.	Looking forward to manufacturing of the device locally and getting most of the raw materials locally like copper.
13.	Supporting of the local businesses example casing manufacturing of the device by 3DCreation Dynamics in Lusaka.
14.	The invention will reduce cost of maintenance on equipment and vehicles due to accidents.
15.	The invention will reduce the increased number of death due to traffic accidents.
16.	The device assures the business houses of the road safety to do transportation business 24 hrs service for the system will continuously be monitored and it automatically alerts road users of potential hazard ahead.
17.	The invention will increase production for the business houses due to reduced downtime as the result of accidents of that nature.
18.	The invention will mitigate road sign poles vandalism
