## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

I) Addis Ababa City administration does not have a system to integrate and properly manage infrastructure assets in the city. The integrated infrastructure mapping was a proposed idea by the accelerator lab, which resulted from our recent embodiment within the UNDP programs/projects/units to provide problem-solving support. Integration of smart infrastructure in urban development has been an issue for the past decade, while meager progress has been recorded and still it is an area of development. As a result, infrastructure such as water lines, electricity cables, telephone, road etc on which government has invested a lot are frequently damaged one by the responsible organizations themselves damaging the other while installing/constructing or maintaining their own and second by other entities such as the private investor during investment.  This has significant negative socio-economic impacts forcing the government to incur an unnecessary cost, obstructing economic activities, and dissatisfying the public. The lab organizes sensemaking workshops that help us to frame the “future state” which is the desired state wanted to have, then identify the “gap” that hinders us from reaching the desired state and then co-create a solution to bridge the gap. Accordingly, the desired future that Infrastructure Management and Integration in Addis Ababa should be efficient, Sustainable, and resilient with the ultimate goal of achieving improvement in the quality of life, improving awareness, and improving competitiveness within the Addis Ababa city administration.  

II) In assessing the current status of desk review, we were able to see that more than 120 damages are recorded on Water and Sanitation lines during the construction/maintenance of infrastructure by different entities in the last 5 years. As a result, the city administration has incurred an unnecessary cost of more than Birr 340 million to restore the service and more than Birr 35 million is spent to maintain damages on electricity cabals in two districts in 2021 alone.  More than 1,300 road sites are damaged in the city for which hundreds of millions of Birrs are spent on maintenance. Analyzing challenges and gaps identified that are causing the above damage generates insight collectively by the participants like the lack of a database on infrastructure assets most institutions do not have a well-organized database of their assets which makes maintaining and locating for third parties difficult and those who have database is not accessible to others to know where what is and integrate which resulted in no coordinated database. 

III) Through collective intelligence we have seen the gaps in behavior and mindset that lack cooperation by the leadership of institutions when they are requested for information and joint planning that cause delays and lack of openness to accept the new way of doing or new technology by some leadership. Horizontal expansion of the city instead of vertical demands big investment in infrastructure as well as the high rate of increase in population as compared to the low capacity of the municipality was also a gap seen. In this regard, some improvements are being recorded which can be taken as an opportunity and good practices which are summarized here under the establishment of a Construction Permit and Control Authority which is responsible for infrastructure integration is a step forward. Through the coordination of this organization, new development sites such as condominiums are having an integrated infrastructure. Designs are checked and all organizations are asked to integrate their design during planning. Some organizations such as roads authority are introducing Property and Asset Management systems. Ethiopian Electric utility also mapped and geolocated its assets like electric poles and transformers. 

IV) Following analysis of the existing status of smart city- integrated smart infrastructure mapping as well to create an open space for problem-solving we have led collective intelligence to bring about data and information from different stakeholders on what the smart city means from residents and municipality perspectives and how can we engage the community directly on the problem definition and ideation within the SMART CITY HUB. It gives us an insight as a foundation to get the state of smart city concepts and build upon the already started initiative by the Sheger Resilience Project. Collectively the participants state that Smarty city is all about innovation and scoring with enabling environment such as infrastructure and governance. Creating a mutual environment for innovators and governance. The internal brainstorming session that has included the city administration's partnership office also revealed potential areas of smart city operation where the city can respond to the growing demands of the urban population and pressing livelihood challenges. SMART infrastructure, SMART transportation, SMART service, and SMART governance were identified. These areas will be explored through future deep dive sessions to prioritize and validate their relevance with stakeholders at different levels including the municipality. 

V) The collective intelligence participants have identified four potential areas of smart interventions. The team will further explore, therefore, to zoom in specific and experimental urban smart solution. The accelerator lab to consult the city administration’s responsible unit. The expected outcomes of the discussion will be prioritized area of smart city intervention, defining what resource it requires and share of responsibilities. Following the identified priorities, the lab team organized a solution safari exercise in the science museum that was inaugurated recently which exhibition spaces that will collect, restore, and preserve homegrown findings. We have mapped innovative and future ideas, services, and products which focused on smart cities solutions specifically smart mobility, smart health, smart education, smart housing etc.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- To map the infrastructure and brainstorm about the integration with SMART technologies we have seen a lack of standards on infrastructure investments. There is no standard that forces the establishment of utility corridors during construction, especially roads. As a result, all utility lines are buried and congested under the pedestrian road which leads to damage during maintenance or establishment network by one of them. Some of the infrastructures are established outside of the master plan and structural plan of the city. Lack of coordination to develop a joint plan by institutions that leads to damaging already established infrastructure while emplacing another that comes late. Whenever a joint plan is developed, some institutions face a shortage of funding during implementation that causes delays in others.  

- Governance was also another bottleneck especially when it comes to scaling up. Not allocating enough budget mainly for coordination of infrastructure & monitoring and poor foresight during planning that gives no room for installation of another new infrastructure type at leads to damage on the existing ones while establishing network were some of them.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- The exploration involves direct interviews and Participatory observation to see how mapped a system integrates and properly manages infrastructure assets in the city. 

- We have also used Literature review and open data to understand what smart city-integrated smart infrastructure mapping means, what smart city means as well as how can we engage the community directly on the problem definition and ideation within the SMART CITY HUB. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- The lab used collective intelligence to get the state of smart city concepts and build upon the already started initiative by the Sheger Resilience Project. Millstones and action points identified as insight and scale on our next step. 

- The lab team used solution mapping in the science museum that was inaugurated recently which exhibition spaces that will collect, restore, and preserve homegrown and more broadly African findings. We have mapped innovative and future ideas, services, and products which focused on SMART Cities.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

- Using unusual data sources as well as bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight within a short period of time in different topics as well-diversified learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implemented in a previous implementation form. It enables us to see different insights which we didn’t see in the normal project implementation ways. It also enables us to use fewer resources since we have done many activities through collaboration with other partners which makes the lab approach less resource incentive method.
