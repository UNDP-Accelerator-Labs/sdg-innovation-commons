Reducing gender violence: justice operators and schools
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is tackling both ends of a single thread: prevention and repair in regards to gender violence. Prevention: working with adolescents in schools to change perception and behavior towards gender violence and discrimination by using pedagogical methods. Repair: participatory construction of geo-referenced routes of memory and injustice with families’ victims of femicide for two purposes. First, to contribute to symbolic redress, justice demand and resist oblivion. Second, to increase awareness and empathy among justice operators (prosecutors and expert witnesses) to enable more effective actions and reduce revictimization.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Ecuador, a woman is victim of femicide every 44 hours, yet, since 2013 there has been a recrudescence of conservatism and a setback in women's rights, more intensely in the latest years. The feminist agenda has been displaced from the national political project. -At the beginning of 2013, within the framework of the judicial reform, the Women's Police Stations were closed to be replaced by the Judicial Units for Women and the Family in a slow process that left empty spaces, especially in rural cantons. -Abortion was penalized by the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code (COIP) of January 2014, with penalties of up to 2 years for women who consent to having an abortion performed on their bodies. -In March 2015, the National Intersectoral Strategy for the Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy and Family Planning (ENIPLA) was eliminated and replaced by the Ecuador Family Plan, with proposals to establish traditional gender roles and the proposal of abstinence to prevent adolescent pregnancy. -In 2018, the Ministry of Justice was eliminated, producing great impact for repairment policies for victims of violence and other justice processes. -De-criminalization of abortion was vetoed by president this year and Assembly voted against it. -Gender violence Law has limited funding and there´s a weal articulation of institutions. -This year, Judicial Units for Women were eliminated which means having prosecutors with no gender approach violence deal with all sort of felonies. -The lack of specialized prosecutors means that gender violence crimes are in the hands of untrained people or with little knowledge or empathy (before, those in specialized offices had more days off as a self-care measure, for instance). -Ecuador was recently shocked by a femicide occurred in the premises of a police school, the perpretator being a police officer. This produced massive rallies and increased lack of credibility on the Estate. -Effective training and immersion is needed urgently.- FLOWERS in the air, offers the possibility of symbolic redress to families and becoming an awareness tool. Furthermore, schools are not an exception for gender violence to occur, along with other forms of violence such as bullying. Perpetrators involve peers, teachers and other school members, affecting one in three children (Unesco, 2018). -Between march and august 2020, violence in schools show: i) 11,404 cases of psychological violence; ii) 2525 cases of sexual abuse; iii) 2213 cases of rape against women; and iv) 1888 cases of physical violence against women. -The actors involved in this situation is the entire education community through their teaching practices and the education authorities through ineffective mitigation and control mechanisms to eradicate gender violence within schools. For this reason, the initiative “Brave Schools” is needed to prevent gender violence scenarios from taking place in schools.

+ Flowers in the air: 86% of the cases, the femicides had a sentimental relationship with the victim and in 14% they had no relationship with them. -These first months of the year 2022 show an increase of 50% of cases in relation to the same period in the year 2021, which alarms us deeply since 2021 was the most violent year for women and girls in Ecuador and in 2022 the figures are even higher.   -From the information available in 2022, it is known that at least 9 women were mothers, leaving at least 19 children and adolescents orphaned. These are invisible victims who sometimes become witnesses to the brutal crime against their mother. They and they require attention, protection and urgent comprehensive repair.   -It is known that at least 3 of the 28 women had previously reported a history of violence and one of them had a help ticket. Because the protection system continues to fail for women and impunity continues to be normal in our country, it is necessary to work with Justice System operators. -Government data show that between 2014 and May 2020, more than 4,220 children and adolescents reported sexual violence by teachers, school staff, and peers.

The context is challenging with a Justice system that fails to provide adequate sentences to perpetrators, integral repair and justice. The recent femicide on the hands of a police officer, produced social unrest, rallies and political authorities resignations. We see, however, small signs that civil society pressure and advocacy does play an important role in changes. For instance, in the context where gender violence is receiving great media coverage, some measures are being taken, among them, a recent policy to provide families with orphans with  monetary aide. We learned that monetary aide is only available to those cases where there is Judicial sentence, leaving out many affected families. This was brought to their attention by civil society organizations, allied to htis project, and this requirement was removed from the policy. In other words, we see as effective, bridging voices from the community to bring in quick and informed changes in policies. It is a moment where social pressure and advocacy may have an effect.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Flowers in the air: the Justice System has failed to bring justice and repair to families and women victims of violence. Understanding integral repair requires connecting with the victims and not only learning legal frameworks or theorizing. Public servants precarious conditions, lack of training, lack of gender perspective produce biased actions. We want to test using other sources to see if these are more effective in enhancing empathy and awareness of what repair means. +On the other hand, with "brave schools", we are testing whether violence perception is increased with pedagogical methods as a first step to de-normalize gender violence and discrimination within schools. To work with adolescents and the Ministry of Education by using behavioral insight is all new to UNPD´s portfolio. We are adding up to the work done by other stakeholders by generating evidence about this intervention that could lead to evidence-based policy.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Flowers in the air: can exposure to first-hand narratives from families victims of feminicide bring higher awareness among Justice Operators?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Flowers in the air: the information we have collected in the first phase (micro narratives through ethnographic practices and cartography) is to become a training tool. It has been curated and located on a digital map, of open access to citizens and Justice Operators in a moodle on gender violence. We want to identify reactions obtained from trainees, who traditionally have received theoretical information, but no access to real stories.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We don´t have a baseline, however, measuring or evaluating the increase of awareness amongst prosecutors in relation to the justice system processes lived by families and their loss, can give us an idea if training should use other sources of information that are not only theoretical. First person testimonies may be more effective. We will provide the National Prosecutor Office with results, from over 300 responses, processed and analyzed with Nvivo Software and qualitative measures. We will cross variables by gender to see if there are differences in responses by gender.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Brave schools: Is it possible to change perception and behavior towards gender violence and socio-cultural discrimination by using pedagogical methods? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Brave schools -> Randomized Controlled Trial: We are testing, in a high school, in two different groups, one expose to the intervention (treatment) and another group is not (control) whether the three pedagogical methods that we are using could have an effect on participants ‘perception and behavior regarding gender violence and socio-cultural discrimination. Behavioral insight: In a patriarchal society, gender roles and stereotypes are reinforced through the education system. Thus, it was key to generate an intervention tackling behavior change within the school community to go from a culture that replicates and normalizes gender violence to a culture that aims for equality. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Brave schools: we used a mix-method approach to assess the school community perception on gender violence before the intervention and after. We run a survey at the beginning of the intervention and at the end to know how different types of violence (verbal, physical, psychological) are perceived and experience by the participants. Also, during the intervention we did focus groups and collected individual reflections of the participants. Finally, we observed how behavior changed during the implementation of the pedagogical methods, how gender roles were questioned. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Flowers in the air: public sector can learn about how to be more effective in training and awareness programs. Brave schools: the Ministry of Education can scale this initiative in the territory.
