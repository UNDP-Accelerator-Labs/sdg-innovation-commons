Infrastructural

> Description of the solution

A major contributor to heat emissions within a city are cars and vehicles. One way to address this is planners designate areas within a city as car-free-zones. These areas are then only accessible by public transport, foot or bicycle, reducing emissions of heat, pollutants and greenhouse gases. Bus lanes can also be incoporated into a citys design, to encourage more use of public transport.
