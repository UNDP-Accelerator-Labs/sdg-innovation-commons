Towards a Self Sufficient Jordan: New Wheat Growing Project Launches in Amman

"Do you want to learn how to grow wheat in the capital, Amman, from start to finish? Do you want to plant your wheat and have enough stock for about a year? Want to know the different products and foods we can make from wheat grain other than flour? Do you know that Jordan imports 97% of its wheat and grains needs and that it is the main source of energy and calories for Jordanians?"

With these questions Rabee Zureikat, founder of Zikra Initiative, started calling people in Amman to join a new project to grow wheat, inspired by the lockdown and necessity to have a stock of food to sustain oneself and family at all times.

"Our food is controlled from outside, and it is possible in any circumstance that we become deprived of it under political or other pressures. We do not have sovereignty over our food and the reason is simple because most of it is not produced in Jordan. For this reason, it is necessary to start thinking about how to produce our food ourselves by investing in the available resources.” Zureikat added.
