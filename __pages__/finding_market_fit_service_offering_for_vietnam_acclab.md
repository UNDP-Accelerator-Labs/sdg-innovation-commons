Localize a Market-fit Offer for Vietnam AccLab Innovation Service 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the UNDP Viet Nam AccLab and CO need to fundraise and establish a cost-recovery mechanism for our activities to ensure Lab sustainability and continued viability 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Over the past decades, Viet Nam has experienced rapid economic growth, transitioning from a low-income to a low-middle-income country. While this progress is a positive milestone, it has led to a significant decline in Official Development Assistance (ODA), as international donors shift their focus to lower-income nations. As a result, UNDP Viet Nam and the Accelerator Lab must explore alternative funding models to sustain our work in driving innovation for sustainable development. 

This challenge is further compounded by a global decline in international development funding, as donor priorities shift towards domestic concerns and emerging global crises. Development organizations worldwide are facing increased pressure to demonstrate financial sustainability and justify their value proposition beyond traditional models. 

At the same time, Viet Nam is undergoing a major political restructuring under its new leadership. While this has created a temporary bureaucratic freeze, there are emerging policy opportunities, particularly with Resolutions 57 and 03, which signal a strong governmental push for science, technology, and innovation (STI). This shift presents a window for the Lab to position itself as a key partner in Viet Nam’s innovation landscape. 

However, a fundamental challenge remains: Viet Nam’s government has historically not paid for UN services. Unlike the private sector or donor-funded initiatives, government institutions are accustomed to receiving ODA rather than using their own budgets to procure services from international organizations. This lack of precedent presents both a mindset and structural barrier to positioning UNDP and the Accelerator Lab as a viable service provider in innovation consulting. 

As a result, the current situation produces several undesired effects: 

- Uncertain financial sustainability of the Lab beyond 2025, risking a loss of innovation capacity within UNDP Viet Nam. 

- Limited agility in responding to local needs, as reliance on donor funding dictates priorities rather than market-driven demand. 

- Missed opportunities for client partnership with the Vietnamese government, as existing UNDP support is often viewed through the lens of donor-funded technical assistance rather than as a strategic service offering. 

- To overcome these challenges, the Lab must navigate a fundamental shift in how it operates—transforming from a donor-dependent initiative into a financially sustainable, market-responsive innovation service provider.

Declining ODA and Shifting Donor Priorities: 
Between 2000 and 2020, Vietnam was a major recipient of Official Development Assistance (ODA), receiving between $1 – $4 billion annually.  According to the DevelopmentAid Country Report on Vietnam (2018), Vietnam’s net Official Development Assistance as a percentage of GDP has steadily declined as the country’s robust economic growth has gradually reduced its aid dependency due to Vietnam's improved human development indicators and its entry into middle-income country status.  .   

Financing Challenges and IDA Graduation: 
The Oxfam Library report on Financing Development in Vietnam offers an in-depth analysis of Vietnam’s shift away from concessional financing as it nears IDA graduation. This report details how key donors—including Japan, USAID, and the EU—are adjusting their portfolios, leading to significant reductions in concessional aid. Such recalibration underscores the urgency for Vietnam to explore alternative funding mechanisms to sustain its development agenda. 

Innovation Policy and R&amp;D Investment: 
Recent policy moves, such as Vietnam’s Resolution 57-NQ/TW (2023) and Resolution 03/NQ-CP (2024), aim to boost the nation’s innovation ecosystem by enhancing digital transformation and public–private partnerships. Meanwhile, World Bank data indicate that current R&amp;D investment is around 0.5% of GDP, with a target of 2% by 2030—an ambitious goal to drive sustainable economic transformation.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Our existing relationship with government partner such as the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the National Innovation Center (NIC), and provincial such as Danang and Hue hint at a growing interest in leveraging UNDP expertise for innovation consulting. This is something we have done for free in previous years, but it can be potential entry point for UNDP’s services. 

New leadership in Vietnam and a strong push in innovation and technology such as with Resolution 57 and 03 in 2024-2025 to push investment in R&amp;D indicate a room of opportunity

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Accelerator Lab Viet Nam brings a unique, systems-focused approach to innovation that sets it apart from traditional development actors, private sector consultancies, and government agencies. Our five years of on-the-ground experimentation, deep contextual knowledge, and global network of 90+ Labs uniquely position us to tackle this challenge. 

 

1. A Proven Track Record in Innovation &amp; Experimentation 

The Lab has pioneered lean experimentation, solutions mapping, and systems thinking to address complex challenges in circular economy waste management, digital transformation, and public sector innovation. 

Unlike traditional UNDP country programs, which focus on policy advocacy and large-scale interventions, the Lab is agile, adaptive, and iterative—able to prototype, test, and refine innovation models before scaling. 

 

2. Bridging the Gap Between Government, Development, and Market-driven Innovation 

The Vietnamese government recognizes the need for innovation but lacks the internal capacity to design and execute human-centered, experimental approaches. 

Private sector consultancies provide innovation services but are often detached from local development needs and lack a sustainability lens. 

The Accelerator Lab operates at the intersection of these two spaces—leveraging UNDP’s policy credibility while offering the agility and problem-solving mindset of a start-up. 

3. Global Knowledge + Local Application 

Through the UNDP Accelerator Labs network, we have access to cutting-edge methodologies, global case studies, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities, ensuring that Viet Nam benefits from global best practices. 

Our deep contextual expertise in Viet Nam’s unique governance, economic, and cultural landscape allows us to localize and tailor innovation services in ways that international consulting firms cannot. 

4. A Unique and Sustainable Business Model 

Unlike traditional UNDP programs, which rely on ODA and donor grants, the Lab’s new fee-for-service model will create financial sustainability, reducing reliance on external funding. 

This approach aligns with the Vietnamese government’s push for public-private partnerships in innovation, creating an opportunity to mainstream innovation services as a strategic investment rather than a donor-funded activity.
