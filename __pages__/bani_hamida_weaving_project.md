This women's cooperative in Mukawir village (by the side of the road leading to the castle) is run by the Bani Hamida Centre and is a good place to buy gorgeous, colourful kilims and cushions. Designs reflect contemporary tastes and traditional Bedouin patterns. The kilims aren't super cheap, but the fixed prices fairly reflect the labour that went into their weaving.

Rebecca Salti is a pioneer of women’s empowerment in Jordan. In 1985, she established the Bani Hamida Weaving Project as country director of Save the Children in Jordan. The project became a model income-generation project throughout the developing world and is internationally known. It continues today with the participation of three generations of rural Bedouin women of the Bani Hamida Tribe. Rebecca’s skills, energy, and vision led her to establish other income-generation programs in Jordan. This article includes excerpts of an interview with Rebecca, a U.S. native, which presents her insights about the project and women’s empowerment.
