> Title of the innovation

Life In Diversified and Motivated Agriculture (LIDMA) Grow a LIMA and save a LIMA.. A farmer should be Motivated and empowered at small scale level as to be able to grow what they can consume at domestic level and sale the othe lima at and acceptable market value

> Brief description of the innovation

The Life in Diversified and Motivated Agriculture (LIDMA ) innovation is an initiative of empowering small scale farmers at chiefdom level. Grow a LIMA and save a LIMA. When a small farmer is motivated and empowered to diversify and produce enough for domestic consumption and the other LIMA for sale to Government at an acceptable market value.  This initiative can be effectively be implemented through chiefdoms. A chiefdom has land, water and people, that is where it should start from. Help the chiefdom develop their own strategic plan and Foster their own development. A chiefdom with a strategic plan has a leadership structure within their Kuta which can Foster agricultural policies

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With viable agricultural policies in place. Where the cost of production becomes minimal the farmer shall'll be encouraged to grow from a small scale farmer to a medium and eventually to a commercial farmer.  If we allow and encourage enhanced production of quality products then we are adding value to the market by ensuring that we have enough for domestic consumption and able to export the excess.  The Government should be the targeted market at a competitive price.  With an expanded production, Government shall swing into expanding the market both local and international.  Government will embark on the processing industries, packaging and transportation etc.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation will be implemented through the chiefdom structure.  Help the chiefdom develop their development strategic plan and strengthen the leadership structure.  The chiefdom has land,water and people. Investment should start from a local and lower level and it continues to grow.  From the village in the rural areas to the urban town Investment and saving shall be a norm.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the lives of many households because they will have food for consumption but also be able to sell the excess at a competitive price that will enable them to be able to send a girl child to school and discourage early marriage because of poverty. Its a supply chain, a farmer produces, need for transportation, packaging and processing into finished products.  Life in a Diversified and Motivated Agriculture is relevant because it will help aliviate poverty among the rural population and here by reduce unnecessary urbanisation
