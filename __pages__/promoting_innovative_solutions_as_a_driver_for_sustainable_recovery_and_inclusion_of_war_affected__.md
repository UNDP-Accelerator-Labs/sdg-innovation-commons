PROMOTING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AS A DRIVER FOR SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY AND INCLUSION OF

WAR-AFFECTED POPULATIONS ON THE UKRAINIAN PATH TOWARD EU ACCESSION
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that Ukrainians of different ages and genders are facing immense difficulties as the country navigates the path toward EU Accession and strives for sustainable socio-economic growth amidst the ongoing war, widespread displacement, and severe economic and energy challenges.

How can we harness the potential of individuals and communities through innovative approaches to social inclusion, rebuilding social networks, engaging the private sector, and promoting the circular economy to empower them and support comprehensive recovery and socio-economic development efforts?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Notwithstanding the mixed picture of longer-term reforms, in the face of sustained Russian aggression, the Ukrainian government and institutions continue to demonstrate remarkable resilience and agility, underpinned by the overall resilience of the social fabric.

In the area of state and local governance, Ukraine’s programme of governance reforms has been disrupted by Russia’s invasion, slowing down the transition towards a modern democracy with strong institutions, underpinned by the rule of law.

Despite these significant challenges, the situation is further exacerbated by a compounded, multi-dimensional environmental crisis associated with chemicals and the remnants of war.

Pollutants released from war-damaged fuel storage facilities, industrial and energy infrastructure, waste management systems, etc., emit hazardous materials into the air, water, and land, posing severe health risks that may last generations.

In general, the resilience of the Ukrainian government and its people continues to be tested, with long-term implications for both the social and environmental health of the nation, which requires innovative approaches to effectively address and mitigate these multifaceted challenges, ensuring sustainable recovery and development.

However,

the cost to humanity of the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine has been

vast[1].

Around 24,862 civilian deaths[2].  Over 3,67 million refugees have fled across

Europe[3].

6,5 mln. of Ukrainian refugees, 3,7 mln. of internally displaced persons, 2 mln

households were affected by damaged or destroyed housing, a fivefold increase

in poverty to 24,1% - up from 5,5%[4].

[1] Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 was presaged

in 2014 by the illegal annexation of Crimea and its move to culturally,

politically, and economically integrate the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of

Ukraine into the Russian Federation, summarised from UN CCA 2023, p.5-9.

The Ukrainian context is characterized by a dynamic yet challenging

environment where social and green transformations are critical for sustainable

development.

According to a comprehensive UNDP-led Human Impact Assessment[1],

the war in Ukraine has significantly affected social inclusion Impact of the War on Social Inclusion and Vulnerable

Groups. Around 45% of

the population now belongs to at least one vulnerable group, such as internally

displaced persons (IDPs), persons with disabilities (PWDs), and older persons.

These groups have experienced the lowest income levels and face discrimination,

especially in seeking employment or accommodation.​

The assessment also highlights severe challenges related to gender

equality, with 3.6 million people at risk of gender-based violence. About 55%

of women reported feeling unsafe in their daily lives, and a significant number

of women are burdened with unpaid domestic work, spending over 50 hours per

week on chores​.

Communities like Ternopil are spearheading international donors

supported initiatives to create green hubs and foster innovation at the

community level, like “Mayors for economic growth”. These initiatives reveal a

strong community drive to overcome socio-economic and environmental challenges,

but they also highlight gaps in capacity and resource availability that

innovative approaches need to address. The enthusiasm of community actors and

the success of previous projects suggest a readiness to adopt new solutions,

yet the need for sustainable funding models and partnership-building remains a

critical gap.
