Pilot Project: Community Empowerment Hub
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Among the implications of poverty in Indonesia is the existence of People in Need of Social Services (PPKS). This marginalised communities, which consist of 26 categories including homeless, beggars, and scavengers, exist particularly in big cities. Despite the existing government efforts and programs to build their capabilities to work in the formal sectors or become entrepreneurs, many returned to the streets due to the lack of financing to start their own small enterprises as well as lack of monitoring on the sustainability aspect of the enacted empowerment programs. 

In response to this social welfare issue, UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab conducted a participatory study to better understand the complex challenges faced by PPKS communities in 2023. Insights from this study are then used as the basis to design a sustainable intervention to empower the PPKS communities and improve their overall living conditions. 

Building from the study results and consultations with government entities, our challenge is to design a project to empower the urban poor communities to be independent and improve their overall living conditions. One potential concept is to build a hub for empowerment of the urban poor communities through vocational training and entrepreneurial mentorship.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The challenge of poverty and marginalization among urban poor communities, particularly the People in Need of Social Services (PPKS), in Indonesia has deep historical roots and is influenced by various socio-economic factors. Rapid urbanization and rural-to-urban migration as well as income inequality have led to the proliferation of informal settlements and slums in major cities across Indonesia. 

On a daily basis, the PPKS communities face social stigma and discrimination based on their socio-economic status, leading to marginalization and exclusion from mainstream society. They also access lack of government administration documents which exacerbates their marginalization and restricts their access to essential government’s supports and outreach programmes (such as education, healthcare, housing, and financial services). Despite efforts to provide vocational training and entrepreneurship support, many PPKS individuals struggle to establish sustainable livelihoods due to limited access to capital, market opportunities, and support networks. The absence of comprehensive and integrated empowerment programs contributes to the perpetuation of poverty and vulnerability among urban poor communities. 

The undesired effects of the current situation include persistent cycles of poverty and vulnerability among urban poor populations, social unrest, crime, and insecurity in marginalized communities, social exclusion and discrimination based on socio-economic status, underutilization of human capital and productive resources, as well as negative impacts on health, education, and well-being outcomes for PPKS individuals and families.

Indonesia has made significant progress in poverty reduction over the years, reaching a poverty rate of around 9% in 2023. [1] However, further efforts are still needed to achieve the target of 6.5-7.5% by 2024. In 2023, the Indonesia’s Central Statistics Agency (BPS) released the data on extreme poverty at 1.90 USD PPP, and approximately more than 3 million individuals in the country still live in extreme poverty.  

According to the Kemensos, there are approximately 77,500 homeless and beggars throughout big cities. [2] This reported number is likely to be heavily underestimated, given how urban poverty is a dynamic issue that leads to difficulties in data collection. A report by the National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) indicates how data collection done through home care/residential institutions tend to be passive, following the number of PPKS reached by their programs. [3] In consequence, there is no comprehensive data on the PPKS number and the urban areas where they are most active, which implies the need for better mapping.

Through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with PPKS individuals that UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab conducted last year, we identified the pressing needs of PPKS communities, the barriers faced to improve their living conditions, as well as the potential interventions to address these complex issues.

Field observations and community consultations reveal the persistent vulnerability of PPKS communities, with many individuals and families struggling to meet their basic needs for shelter, food, and healthcare. Despite existing government programs, PPKS individuals continue to face socio-economic challenges that hinder their ability to break out of cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Stakeholder consultations and expert interviews indicate a growing recognition of the importance of holistic and integrated solutions to address the multifaceted challenges faced by PPKS communities. A comprehensive approach, such as the Community Empowerment Hub proposed by UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab, is urgently needed to provide tailored support, build community resilience, and promote sustainable livelihoods.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab brings added value through its innovative, collaborative, and evidence-based approach to tackling the challenge of empowering PPKS communities through the establishment of the Community Empowerment Hub.  

Our Lab adopts a system thinking approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to the marginalization of PPKS communities. By engaging community members in participatory decision-making processes and collaborating with diverse stakeholders (including government agencies, civil society organizations, and private sector partners), we can co-create solutions that are contextually relevant, culturally sensitive, and sustainable in the long term.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What is a potentially scalable, public-private partnership framework to enable sustainable investment in and empowerment for vulnerable communities in urban cities in Indonesia?  

To address this learning question, the team will need to articulate the right champions and actors – especially government agencies and social enterprises – to engage. The pilot project will need to be co-designed and co-created, outlining the criteria for targeted communities as well as the type of vocational and entrepreneurial trainings to sustainably alter their means of living and enable them to build their own business. Finally, a monitoring and evaluation mechanism via digital application needs to be considered as additional supports to help ensure the effectiveness and sustainability/scalability of the project.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The project design will be based on the participatory approach involving relevant stakeholders (government, CSOs, MSMEs/social enterprises) to understand the beneficiaries’ needs and experience to create effective solutions in empowering the urban poor communities. This project design is also envisioned to provide insights to the government’s policies and programmes.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The new source of data will enable a better understanding on the complexity of challenges faced by the urban poor communities hence strengthening the project design to better cater to the needs of these marginalised communities. Through these additional data, we can also map and identify potential actors during the prototyping phase. 
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



As a proof of concept, this pilot project focuses on enhancing the capacity of urban poor communities, thereby offering direct benefits to marginalized groups residing in major Indonesian cities. If implemented at scale, it is also anticipated to yield indirect advantages for the government, including reductions in extreme poverty and unemployment rates. 

The implementation of the project should entail collaboration with social enterprises, which will play a crucial role in delivering capacity-building and mentoring programs to the targeted communities. The involvement of both local and national government entities is also essential, as they will be responsible for providing necessary facilities, supportive policies, and oversight to ensure the sustainability of the project's outcomes.
