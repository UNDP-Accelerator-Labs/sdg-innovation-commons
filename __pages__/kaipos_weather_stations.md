> Description of the solution

KAIPOS Weather Stations is a system that provides real-time weather data tailored for agricultural use. These stations collect a variety of environmental metrics, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and solar radiation. The data collected supports better decision-making for farmers, enabling them to optimize irrigation, protect crops from adverse weather, and manage resources more effectively. KAIPOS stations also allow data visualization and can send alerts to help farmers take timely actions based on weather conditions.
