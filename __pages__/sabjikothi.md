Sabjikothi

> Description

"Sabjikothi" means "A Chamber for Vegetables". This innovation can store perishable fruits and vegetables for up to 10-40 days and requires 10-20 watts of electricity (on or off grid) and 2-3 liters of water to operate. This is a blessing for smallholder farmers and vendors who cannot afford inventory or storage facilities to run their business. Farmers can store up-to 300-400 kgs of produce at one time. A mobile app is also being developed that would help the farmers control the micro-climate inside the chamber.
