> Technical Feasibility

Once funded the software product will be copyrighted and protected from theft (duplication of project name and/or functionality) of project , we will then be able to purchase machinery for flashdrive labeling and packaging. We will procure a vehicle/vehicles for the delivery of discover powerpoint flash drive to the retailer shops. Discover powerpoint will be highly advertised on National TV(ZNBC), BBC and OTHER famous radio stations.
