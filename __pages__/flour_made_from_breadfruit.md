Description: A 25-year-old Fijian medical student came up with the innovative idea to make breadfruit flour and through this business venture ‘Grassroots Fiji’, he is also assisting some Nadi villagers who have been affected by COVID-19, by sourcing all raw produce from these villages. Breadfruit flour is said to be a healthier alternative to wheat flour as it is gluten free, has low glycemic index, and is nutrient dense. Additionally, breadfruit protein is easier to digest than wheat protein.
