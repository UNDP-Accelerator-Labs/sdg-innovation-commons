## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand&nbsp; to understand why acces to formal loans are still limited for women entrepreneurs.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Microfinancing in Bolivia have improved opportunities to access to loans, especially for women entrepreneurs in the informal sector. However, despite this fact, microfinacing is not a solution for everyone. Even for micro loans is necessary to accomplish a lot of requeriments. Moreover, small loans usually have high interests and women who are beginning small bussinesses do not have such money to pay the doubt and interests. In a recent reseach about the unmet needs for women entrepreneurs, some women expressed that they do not acceed to microfinancing because it do not meet their needs.

According recently studies (CAF, 2018; CEED, 2020), women that led micro and SMEs in the formal and informal sector, do not use financial products because they do not meet their businesses' needs and due to the disadvantages of women because their economic situation, knowledge and processes of exclusion.&nbsp; &nbsp; In Bolivia. 95% of the businesses are micro and SMEs, of which 70%&nbsp; are run by women in the informal sector. Women-owned businesses represent one of the fastest growing segments in this sector. However, only 20 per cent of women have access to loans or savings, and the gap respect to men is 36% (UN WOMEN Bolivia2021)

In a recent research (2021) led by UN Women Bolivia, some women mentioned that they do not access to finance, not because they do not accomplish the requirements, but because financial products do not met their needs, so they prefer to access to other source of financing, like relatives, friends, investors or save money

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Research about acccess to loans usually are focused on identifying barriers to acomplish the requiremens of banks and microfinancing institutions and the complete problem space is not known as the barriers. Because of that, working on this challenge will give us information about the comprehensive solutions to access to finance. With this information it will be possible to develop adecuate products, processes and tools, especially focused on women entrepreneurs in the informal sector.
