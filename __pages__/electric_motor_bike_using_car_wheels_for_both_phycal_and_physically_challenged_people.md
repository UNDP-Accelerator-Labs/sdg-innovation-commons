> Title of the innovation

Electric motor bike using car wheels for both phycal and physically challenged people

> Brief description of the innovation

The used vehicle wheels are everywhere in Zambia, then we also buy steel tubes or steel pipes fabricate them according to the needs or per our plan. We then buy either bycicle or motor bike parts such as brake disks, chains, sprockets, padles, stands, shocks, sits, bearings then do some machining on some parts, BLDC motors and controllers with batteries are purchased online.. and our future is to start EV conversion in Zambia for climate change.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Simple, a lot of people what to be mobile on affordable transportation and by having a Zambian made product will definitely sale and our workers will gain income..The market aspect is well looked into and on demand. To make it more green energy we will provide solar charging system meaning even in the village this product will sale. The challenge in pricing is the importation of motor, controllers, batteries , onboard chargers and BMS. However once we start our own local manufacturing of motors, batteries and controllers will reduce the prices.

> Technical Feasibility

Our financial problem is the only challenge to have more tools and equipment to use during the manufacturing of these electric bycicles, motorcycles, dessabled motor chairs. Once this is achieved we are ready to go.  Intial finance will help pay the workers we have at the moment also while our sales team ingange government.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our inovation will help the disability people especially physically disabiled. People working with us will have work and then offer training to others to equip them with similar knowledge.
