> Brief description about the identified local solution:

The Washing Machine Project is a social enterprise dedicated to alleviating the burden of hand washing clothes globally, a burden that often falls on women and girls.
The challenge: during displacement, women and girls often bear the burden of hand washing, spending up to 8 hours per week hand washing and consuming up to 40 liters per washing cycle.
The solution: a single, standalone, off the grid washing machine (WM) that will be affordable, portable and accessible for everyone. The WM reduces the washing cycle time to 30 minutes instead of 60-80 min, resulting in time saved which can be put towards more productive uses and will reduce the amount of water used per washing cycle to 10 liters instead of 20-40 liters, addressing the water-scarce conditions in IDP camps.
Target population: Displaced Women and girls in Iraq
