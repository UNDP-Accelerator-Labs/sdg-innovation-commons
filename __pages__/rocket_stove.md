> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The rocket stove is based on a concept developed by the British in the 1850s. He explains, “A British version contains an insulated vertical chimney. I have seen it in many hotels in Kodaikanal and Munnar. This burning stove ensures complete combustion before the flames reach the cooking surface.” He did more research on Google about the British stove before making one. “I have my own company — Excellent Engineering, in Kochi where for the past 40 years, I have been making products such as boilers, and many industrial materials,” Abdul says. With the help of five employees of his company, he created his own version. The 57-year old’s invention is made using 4 mm mild steel sheets, and the oven chamber is made with stainless steel sheets. The materials for the stove were taken from his company and are easily available at the market.
