## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Víctor A. Tablas

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

24/12/2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Food Security and Development

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Evidence to improve the effectiveness on cash based transfers in the adoption of behaviors.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Both food insecurity and poverty are reproduced in a two-way relationship, which affects well-being and human development, the UNDP and the WFP in El Salvador agree on the interest of exploring simple but effective ways of influencing the behaviors of the beneficiaries, helping them to meet their goals and improving the capacities of vulnerable people to overcome conditions of food insecurity and manifestations of poverty, starting with the adoption of family economy behaviors, such as budgeting, joint responsibilities and increasing dietary diversity.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Generate evidence on the way in which non-conditional monetary transfers and the delivery of information based on social norms influence the adoption and changes in family economy behaviors and dietary diversity in the beneficiaries.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis 1: If beneficiaries of non-conditional cash transfers are provided with purchasing planning information through messages that take advantage of the power of influence of social norms, then they increase the adoption of desirable behaviors for the family economy. Hypothesis 2: If beneficiaries of non-conditional cash transfers are provided with information on budgeting for food consumption through messages that take advantage of the power of influence of social norms, then they increase the adoption of desirable behaviors for the family economy. Hypothesis 3: If beneficiaries of non-conditional cash transfers are provided with information on healthy eating and dietary diversity through messages that take advantage of the power of influence of social norms, then their dietary diversity score increases (HDDS).

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

This knowledge product seeks to generate evidence on the way in which non conditional monetary transfers and the delivery of information produce the adoption and changes in family economy behaviors and dietary diversity in the beneficiaries. Specifically, it is proposed that for the delivery of pieces of information and behavior changes, the application of behavioral sciences (Be-Sciences) be used, a field that refers to evidence-based research and understanding of how people actually behave, make decisions, and respond to programs, policies, and incentives. The proposed methodology involves incorporating elements of these behavioral sciences into the information products that the WFP delivers along with the cash transfers and testing in RCT format whether positive effects against a control condition. For this study, the application of the so-called social norms nudges is proposed to influence the effectiveness of the messages delivered.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Beneficiaries of non-conditional monetary transfers in vulnerable locations of La Unión.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

A total of 308 representatives of family groups that receive an unconditional cash transfer will be interviewed. These participant will be divided in 1 control group and 3 treatment groups, made up of a qualified informant at home, randomly assigned to groups. Participants will be interviewed prior to the training provided by WFP.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
