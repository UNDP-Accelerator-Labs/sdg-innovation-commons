## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. New and emerging technologies such as blockchain have immense potential to solve complex development challenges. 2. Participatory design approaches involving key stakeholders helps in securing the ownership and motivation for successful implementation. 3.  It is possible to attract more resources and knowledge partnership along the way by getting initial positive results and sharing these results with donors. 4. Working with government organizations may involve several administrative procedures and approvals which shortens time for actual implementation. An advance planning and risk assessment is key to mitigate some of these delays. 5. There are some unexpected, unintended wins along the way which could be further leveraged to attract more visibility and resources. A keen eye to map these little successes and pitch them appropriately goes a long way for achieving success.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Devising Inclusive Business Models is vital to foster Sustainable Agriculture and Livelihoods in India – ET Edge Insights (et-edge.com)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, quite a few. Mostly due to the administrative procedures and delays at the partner organization (government) that impacted timely delivery of project activities as per plan.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These datasets are relevant for planning project interventions and finalizing the blockchain modules for spices traceability.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These innovation methods were more suitable for the pilot initiative we were undertaking, to co-design and co-create a technological solution (blockchain) that will be used by the government to regulate spices processing and exports from India.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

A few civil society organizations were involved in our pilot to visit the spice farms and validate farmer data of nearly 3000 farmers (geographic locations, crop data, crop processing and packaging data etc).

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We did not work with an academic partner in this frontier challenge. However, we worked closely with Global Standards Organization (GS1), a not-for-profit international organization that is authorized to issue Global Location Numbers (GLNs) and traceability related standards.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with NEC Corporation, a global technology company with expertise in several new and emerging technologies including blockchain. NEC designed the blockchain architecture for our project.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Spices Board India under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India is our key implementation partner.  Spices Board is the key regulator for spices trade and exports from India. They provided guidance on spices value chain as well as field implementation support for the project.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All of them

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The combination of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners helped us in several ways including, securing the key opportunity for Accelerator Lab India to be the knowledge partner for this initiative, with Government of India.  Our value addition are the above unique capabilities which other peer networks and UN agencies were not able to demonstrate. A project of this importance is usually given to specialized agencies in agriculture such as Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Accelerator Lab provided this unique opportunity to UNDP CO which made it possible for us to be the partner of choice for this potential national scale project. In a country with 1.4 billion people and spices export value of 4 billion USD annually, an entity as tiny as Accelerator Lab securing the place of implementation partner is a miracle.
