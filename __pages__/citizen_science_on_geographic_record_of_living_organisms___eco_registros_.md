Description of citizen participation: Citizens take part in recording species by providing accurate coordinates and dates, photographs, video or audio recordings. 

Overall goals: • Identify species. • Create species datasheets. • Disseminate the findings of scientific research. • Perform a leisure activity. Specific goals: • Mapping and determining the geographic distribution of different species on the basis of the data recorded by the community, considering three options: – All records, including those which are not supported by evidence. This implies that more data will be displayed on datasheets and maps. This is very useful for easily identified species. – Only records supported by evidence. This means that datasheets and maps will contain more reliable data, which may be easily validated. This is very useful for species which are harder to identify. – Only such records containing reproduction information. This requires knowledge on species reproduction, and all geographic data which are not relevant to this topic will be discarded. • Generate lists of species for each country, province and district. • Record nature-related events. • Generate personal statistics for each user regarding the species recorded, the number of records entered, and the areas visited.
