A native of Sweida, sought to develop his own experience of redworm breeding and start an integrated farm project to produce organic fertilizer (Vermicomposting) . Red worms are known for being "excellent at breaking down decaying organic materials, creating a nutrient-rich substance for soil.  Red worms turn the soil into a healthy environment. The reason why vermicompost is now spread in different locations in Syria is that fertilizers are expensive and are not allowed to be imported.
