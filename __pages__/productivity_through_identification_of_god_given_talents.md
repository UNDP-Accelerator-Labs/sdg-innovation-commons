> Title of the innovation

Productivity through identification of God given talents

> Brief description of the innovation

As children grow into adults, many are forced to do things they are not meant to. They are forced to study subjects in schools which are not applicable to their God given talents. This innovation seeks to encourage parents and teachers to identify the God given talents in children and further would urge the Ministry of General Education and the Ministry of Higher Education alike to change the syllabi in a such a manner as to have pupils and students study subjects and courses relevant to their God given talents. This will enable our nation and the planet to have relevant skills available when and where needed.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Because not every one will have to go all the way through 12 years of education and 5 years plus of tertiary education, resources will be saved, our country will have entrepreneurs as early as 12 years because talent would have been identified before long even while in primary school, farmers, carpenters would be producing and selling their products at an early stage. The economy would expand much faster because once the local market seems to be overcrowded, reason to export will be found.
Expert knowledge would be inculcated in the young and so the young will not have to wait until they have a degree.

> Technical Feasibility

For starters, the guidance department in schools should start from primary school, and as a child goes from one grade to another, they should be attached to a department. For instance, Agriculture, Botany, Medicine, etc.
Once a child is in their fourth grade, they should be hands - on practicing their skill to verify their abilities.
As they progress to 6th grade, the child is well equipped to actually produce armature products and sell those that are of almost perfection.
As the child progresses to the 8th grade, they should be in a position to produce, make and sell up to standard products and services.
This would have created a path as to what the child should study at senior secondary going forth.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Improved products and services
Fresh products, goods and services as they will be acquired from known 'hands'
Completely eliminates dependency on 'the government'
Makes good use of resources as the 'producer' appreciates the resources and makes good use of the same.
Complete elimination of poverty
Drastically reduces the abuse of drugs and alcohol
Makes it possible for every one to afford goods, products and services that are currently affordable to many.
The nation will have no reason to borrow from external funders as resources will be abundant
The levels of HIV/AIDS infections will be reduced as people will develop a busy mind
