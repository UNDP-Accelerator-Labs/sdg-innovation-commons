With the increased transportation costs in Syria and the imposed sanctions that affects mobility services, a number of local solutions and initiatives were started in different Syrian provinces. Most of these solutions depended on the concept of sharing transportation costs. It started with people starting a public Facebook page where drivers/ cars owners can post their destinations, time of trip, number of available seats and cost of the trip (sometimes they offer free rides).    Recently a number of start- ups created mobile applications that offers mobility as a service. But still the informal Facebook pages covered a wider population, more options, and cheaper costs.
