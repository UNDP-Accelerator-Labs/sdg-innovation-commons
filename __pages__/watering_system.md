> Brief description about the identified local solution:

Establishing an environmentally friendly agricultural irrigation system that works with solar energy as a clean and sustainable alternative energy instead of electric power and fuel energy and is sufficient for watering large areas using the drip irrigation system and medium areas with direct irrigation, and it can also be used to supply medium and large multi-use water tanks with processing up to 6 continuous hours Every day, the environmentally friendly system consists of multiple solar panels (according to the user's needs), an intelligent power inverter, a medium-sized water pump, a control panel and connection cables. Among its advantages 1- Sustainable that uses only solar energy 2- Environmentally friendly and non-polluting with water, air and soil unlike fuel pumps 3- With efficient production capacity 4- Less expensive when compared to fuel pumps 5- Easy to use and control 6- Low maintenance
