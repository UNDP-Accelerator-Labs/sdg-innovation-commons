> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Rayo is the result of a journey undertaken by the organization Engineering Without Borders to promote renewable energies and, thus, accelerate the energy transition, one of the main mechanisms to mitigate the current climate crisis. Through this undertaking, this project seeks to offer a service that facilitates and simplifies the process of solar panel installation so that more and more people can adopt more sustainable consumption habits. In addition, the social entrepreneurship proposes to train people from left-behind neighborhoods in a new trade and promote labor inclusion.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Full commercial application

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

Three photovoltaic systems were already installed in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and over 200 people attended the training course. 

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Having solar panels allows for minimizing the environmental impact, and generates energy and economic savings.
