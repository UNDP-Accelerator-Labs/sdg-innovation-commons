> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Jean Claude Bizumuremyi.

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

IPRC Kigali, phone: +250786721002, email: johnclaudbiz95@gmail.com

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Yes, IPRC Kigali

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The purpose of this solution is to address lack of clean cooking energy in Rwanda where more than 90% of households still rely on polluting traditional biomass-based cooking like firewood and charcoal. These inefficient cooking methods reduce the country’s forest cover, generate indoor air pollution that causes respiratory diseases associated with 1.6 million deaths globally every year and together with decomposing organic wastes dumped in landfills generates greenhouse gases contributing to climate instability

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

500,000 FRW / 515$

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

(TRL.6), the solution has a functional prototype.

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

A market research was conducted and it showed that at least 50 households, that is 85% liked the product and showed willingness to pay for it.

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback
None

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Compared to existing clean cooking energy solutions like biogas system, this solution is cheaper with the cost reduction of about 40%-70% of traditional biogas system.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

None
