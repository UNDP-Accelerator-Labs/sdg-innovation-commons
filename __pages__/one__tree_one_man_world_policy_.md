Restoring our tree environment can keep us healthy and even enrich our agricultural lands. This will keep us alive enough to be productive and enriching our agricultural lands by lessening the direct exposure of our agricultural lands to sunlight.
One of the factors that destroys the fertility of our lands is a direct exposure to the sunlight.
