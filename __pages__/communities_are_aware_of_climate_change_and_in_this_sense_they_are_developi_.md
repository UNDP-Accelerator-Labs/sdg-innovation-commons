## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Communities are aware of climate change and in this sense they are developing more and more innovative local techniques for the development of irrigated crops.Also some structures participate in the conservation of native trees likely to fight against climate change.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

High-resolution satellite images were used to cover a larger geographical area, saving time and accuracy.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The Data Powered Positive Deviance , was established on the belief that lessons on how to tackle complex sustainable development challenges are best learned from the people who face those challenges every day. This is especially useful in contexts where data is scarce or unavailable and to find out what is being developed by communities at the local level.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Les Chambres régionales de l'Agriculture, ONG Niger développement, groupement feminin Gaalo de Zinder, groupement feminin godiya de Maradi, structures régionales de la jeunesse(CRJ)

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

University of Manchester

Ministry of Agriculture

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Regional Chambers of Agriculture, university, companies dedicated to the processing of local products (example: sahara sahel food). The specificity of these structures resides by the fact that what actors who are directly in contact with the field. We can easily access empirical data with them.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?
