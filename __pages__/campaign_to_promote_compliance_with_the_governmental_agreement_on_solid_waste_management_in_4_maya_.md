Different texts were written and designed with the aim of educating and raising awareness among the Guatemalan population about the importance of complying with the governmental agreement on solid waste management. The messages were translated into 4 Mayan languages, which are the most widely spoken in the country.  


The campaign was carried out in different formats (audio and written messages) in order to reach more people and be truly inclusive with the population that does not have the ability to read or has some visual impairment.
