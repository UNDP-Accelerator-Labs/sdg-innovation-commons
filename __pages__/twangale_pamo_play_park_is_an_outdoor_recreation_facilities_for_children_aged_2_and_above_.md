> Title of the innovation

TWANGALE PAMO play park is an outdoor recreation facilities for children aged 2 and above.

> Brief description of the innovation

TWANGALE PAMO play park is the idea of the founder by the name of Bwalya sendapu. The founder is a teacher by profession. The idea was born as a result of lacking outdoor recreation facilities in itezhi-tezhi. The business is at an advanced level of implementation. In the year 2019 Twangale pamo play park was born. We intend to play active role in developing few skills to children and mentor them, so that they become good and fruitful citizen of Zambia and Africa at large. 
Our business is totally a private institution at the moment. We are situated in the south west of Central province of Zambia. Itezhi-tezhi district is lacking a recreational facilities for children. This is the district with urge population of 68599. Lacking of this facility we want to provide has made children to perform poorly at school. Children engage them selves into sexual activities at a tender age and indulge themselves to drug abuse. 
In addressing this we are providing a greater area with a safe , fun, exciting (and profitable ) child entertainment facility for children and their parents, which will help children grow physically, emotionally and mentally through interactive play with their parents, peers and the facility itself.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Marketing plan

Our research into the local market has indicated that a concentrated target marketing effort will yield the best results. We are therefore focusing on the 20, 000 households surrounding Twangale pamo play park with 8,000 children between 2 and 17 years of age. Children in this age range are typically in school yet, and in need of diverse means of recreation, including “play groups” with children of their parents’ friends. As members of this demographic, my Son and I fully understand the need and benefit of offering our children diverse recreational and physical outlets. From experience, this demographic will look for and seek out recreational opportunities for their children for not only the child’s benefit, but for the parent’s benefit as well. Out-of-home facilities that can entertain kids and give parents needed respite are in high demand.
This market is greatly under-served with respect to the services Twangale pamo play park plans to offer in Itezhi tezhi area. The school system can provide this type of recreation to an extent, and there are some businesses that have recreational outlets. However, it is my observation that similar facilities are either too small, seasonal, have health hazards, or are not geared to younger children and their family. Winter is long here, and weather is unpredictable. “TWANGALE PAMO “ will be a preferred destination for families looking for something new, fun, and exciting for themselves and their children, especially if it promotes physical and social growth. Tour of school is another target, weddings , kitchen parties and birthday parties.
We will reach out to our clients through : radio, bronchures, Facebook, twitter and door to door advert.


 












                 Operations plan

Twangale pamo play park will provide a venue in which young children can really enjoy their leisure time by participating in fun and exciting activities that require minimum strength or physical ability. Supported with great service and offered at competitive prices, I believe we have the winning combination.
Once customers choose to come to our location, they have already made a choice to buy our services. We get them there with marketing; we get them back again and again by continuing to offer high-quality, safe, and fun experiences for and with their young children. Our sales strategy involves continuing informal surveys of our customers about their preferences and needs, and keeping an open mind about changes in the adult areas. We may, in the future, institute a small cafe-type service, or offer space for young family book clubs, and so on, depending on feedback from parents.
 Sales Forecast
My sales forecast assumes that, on average, 37% of my market (2960 children, out of a possible 8,000) will visit 1.5 times per month, at an admission price per child of k10.00 We project that parents will spend an average of k100.00 per visit on food and beverages, at a 20% cost of goods. This would allow me an 80% mark up on food and beverages, a reasonable amount given the savings we will get from doing prep work ourselves in the mornings.
Sales will be higher in the summer months, when outdoor competition and free activities are limited, and lower in the winter. In keeping with my sales goals, I anticipate reaching 40% of my market by the 3rd year.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The service am selling is called " active play"
Physical active play for children- playing is fun atany age . If you don't believe me, consider what you do to relieve the stress of an active day at work or school, how your vacation, or what you spend your money on. If you have a hobby or interest . Or , if you have children, just watch how exuberant , carefree and energized they are when they are having a good time. Studies have shown that it is also a major factor in the appropriate mental, social, emotional and physical development of children. When children are engaged in play, they are presented with various situations, interaction and challenges. As they develop competencies in these areas, they are honing the same social , mental and physical skills they will need in other aspects of life.
Vicarious active play for parents.
There is a saying in this world " if mama is not happy, nobody is happy ". I think what is meant by this is that we could drive nuts on accasion, and when we are "nuts" we all suffered. These occasions are typically when We were children, we were bored or stuck in the house. Therefore, I believe that business is also selling fun, rest, and a social outlet for parents. When children are occupied, happy parents can enjoy a book, the newspaper, or a friend's conversation over a cup of coffee or lunch. However, parents are also encouraged to participate with their children on the equipment themselves. Due to the nature and size of some equipment, it is able to withstand and support adults.
Children engage them selves into sexual activities at a tender age and indulge themselves into drug abuse. To address this, we shall provide a place for children which will develop; critical thinking skills, and improve collaboration skills, physical benefits, social and mental benefits. All these needs to be acquired at a tender age.
