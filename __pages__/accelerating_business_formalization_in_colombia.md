Accelerating Business Formalization in Colombia
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to accelerate business formalization in Colombia identifying different approaches through experimentation and a collective intelligence challenge to understand, learn, tap into under the radar “hacks”, and create inputs for the design of better public policies on this matter

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

·         Covid – impacts on small businesses

o   According to DANE, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Colombia lost 509,370 micro-businesses. They went from 5.6 million between January and October 2019 to 5.3 million between January and October 2020.

o   During the second half of 2020, 757,754 jobs disappeared, of which 81% were generated by micro-enterprises.

o   By 2020, 40% of microbusiness owners were in poor households in the country and 90% reported not being affiliated with pensions.

·         Economic reactivation 2021 (EMICRON, DANE, 2021)

o   52.4% of microbusinesses reported that their sales increased during the last quarter of 2021.

o   Although the number of micro-businesses decreased by 2.4% compared to 2020, sales or income in 2021 grew 35.3% and employed personnel increased by 0.4%.

·         AccLab´s previous work to create a systemic understanding of the challenge of (in)formality in Colombia

o   Scan: We explore different global trends around business formalization and informality. We connect with the UNDP accelerator lab network to find out what they are doing in other countries.

o   Research: We research actions, ideas, projects and hacks around formality, and informality in Colombia

o   Understand: With our consultants, we generated inputs to understand the academic, business, social and human

The National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) carried out in 2021 the count of existing Economic Units (natural o legal person carrying out an economic activity), which listed and georeferenced the fixed and semi-fixed establishments, mobile positions and homes with an economic activity.

 

According to DANE, in the municipal capitals of the 32 departments of the country, 2,548,896 economic units were found, of which 83.10% are in a fixed establishment; 9.42% are in a home with economic activity; 4% in mobile positions; and 3.41% in a semi-fixed establishment.

 

Likewise, of the total of the 2,548,846 Economic Units identified, 17.7% are in Bogotá, followed by 11.65% in Antioquia and Cali with 9.95%. The companies that are located in Bogotá are 451.093, where the number of informal entrepreneurs is 73,093, which corresponds to 16%.  However, the floating population, mobility and under-registration do not allow us to be certain of the business informality rate.

 

By sector, the count of the Economic Units shows that 55.2% belongs to the commerce sector, where 50.84% of those are found in Bogotá, followed by 40.1% from the services sector, represented with 32.15% in the city.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Usually, the formalization process has two points of view: the government´s perspective and the citizens' perspective. While the government address it as a binary condition (Formal/Informal), with a wide offer of services with benefits; the citizens see it as a complex, long and expensive process, where the benefits are not evident to them.

The add value of the AccLab is to articulate different actors and create the possibilities to facilitate/accelerate the process from what already exists and experiment with hypotheses generated from them. We want to: 

o   Validate the proposed hypotheses.

o   Generate iterations on the experiments that extend the learning curve.

o   Create a collective intelligence exercise to identify, recognize and reward innovative and transformative initiatives that contribute, promote, or impact the increase in business formalization in Colombia.

o   Obtain inputs to create new approaches to the challenge of business formalization in Colombia

Understanding the barriers and opportunities to promote business formalization in Colombia from the human perspective, could show us new path to experiment and learn about this challenge. Let´s take the leap together and accelerate business formalization in Colombia!

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we accelerate business formalization in Colombia? What are people and microbusinesses doing to face the informality? Which barriers are preventing them to get their businesses formalized?

o   If we facilitate the procedures for entrepreneurs and someone carries out the entire process for them, then the entrepreneurs will be more formalized.

o   If we articulate all the actors of the entrepreneurial ecosystem and institutions in charge of business formalization to support the entrepreneur in his formalization process, then the entrepreneurs will have a clear path towards formalization.

o   If we finance the entire formalization process for entrepreneurs, then they will be much more motivated to complete the process.

o   If efficient selection mechanisms are established in the entrepreneurship support programs, then it will be easier to identify those who want to continue their path towards formality than those who want to be employed.

o   If we provide a meeting space between the actors of the entrepreneurial ecosystem and entrepreneurs who are in the process of formalization, then it will motivate the transition of workers from the informal economy to entrepreneurship.

o   If we identify all those bottom-up solutions that are already being implemented to sort out the informality, then we are going to be able to understand, learn and scale better suited solutions to incentivize business formalization processes.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral insights: We are looking to identify the constraints and motivations to move from informal to formal systems. We had incorporated a consultant to identify behavioral barriers associated with the formalization process.

Collective intelligence: Learning from our previous experience with Life Helmets, we want to launch an open challenge to identify, recognize and reward innovative and transformative initiatives that contribute, promote, or impact the increase in business formalization in Colombia.

Prototyping & human centered design: We have design (through a human centered design based on our previous human understating about the formality challenges). Currently we are implementing 5 prototypes, testing which are the variables that can incentivize the most a formalization in MSMEs.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The aim is to obtain insights of the formalization challenges from the MSMEs perspective, through experimentation and prototyping. We have developed 5 lean-experiments and a collective intelligence challenge, which will provide us with a systemic understanding of the motivations and barriers for MSMEs to move from informality to formality. Our 6 experiments, use direct interviews and a close follow-up process done by our team to the participants, and a behavioral understanding of what motivates or prevents MSMEs to formalize in practice.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

With the 5 lean - experiments we want to:

·         Validate the proposed hypotheses.

·         Generate iterations on the experiments that extend the learning curve.

·         Obtain inputs to create new approaches to the challenge of business formalization in Colombia for the design of better suited public policies.

 

With the collective intelligence challenge, we want to:

·         Create a repository as an open library of easily accessible public information. This open digital library will be for public consultation, as an input for the construction of policies or programs that encourage business formalization.
