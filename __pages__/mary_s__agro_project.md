> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Potatoes they have alot of profit so me it will give me a lot of income, the same income it can be helpful to my fellow youths in investing in other businesses.
Am targeting marketers coz they usually travel in far places to get potatoes.
For the prices they will be atlest abit less in order to attract more customers.
The value is very high.

> Technical Feasibility

I planted my potatoes in a garden so for my plants to fit in my garden I had put the potatoes on one side although the land was able to accommodate alot of sucks.
My is to plant more potatoes not just in sucks but also on land atlest 500 sucks and on land .

> Anticipated Social Impact

Being in a place where 5% of potatoes are planted ,,if I start planting more it will reduce people from traveling far in buying potatoes.
Many more people will be incouraged looking at a young person's project was successful especially the youths hence it minimize poverty.
