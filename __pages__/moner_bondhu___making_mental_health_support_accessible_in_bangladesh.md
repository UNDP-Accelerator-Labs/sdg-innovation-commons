In a research conducted by WHO, it was found that, mental health expenditures from the government health department was less than 0.5 percent of the total national health expenditures in 2012. At that time, a national survey was also conducted. Which reported that 16.05 percent of the adult population in Bangladesh was suffering from mental health disorders. Bangladesh Health Injury Survey (BHIS)-2016 found that in every 100,000 people, nearly 15 die from suicide which was more than other injury related deaths. The national survey conducted in 2019 reports that 2 crore people are suffering from some form of mental illness. So it is an alarming indication of the mental health condition of Bangladesh. In this context, the organization Moner Bondhu was formed with the mission of making professional counselling accessible, affordable, convenient – so anyone who struggles with life’s challenges can get help, anytime, anywhere. Through their counsellors, Moner Bondhu offers access to trained, experienced psychologists, therapists, clinical social workers, and professional counsellors. And their websites and mobile application platform deliver mental healthcare to the people who do not have access to mental health facilities.
