> Title of the innovation

Jet engine with highly improved and efficient cooling system

> Brief description of the innovation

This jet engine has a  turbines that are cooled in a systematic manner and  consequently the turbines can be made of low temperature materials as this has never been the case before.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Jet engine turbines and combustion chamber casing will be efficiently cooled and thus low temperature materials like aluminium can be used to make these parts.also reduced price of jet engine components.

> Technical Feasibility

Its just a simple idea, but I cannot disclose it to the public because people will steal my idea,its for selling, I get cash and you get the idea.for now I cannot go into the details of the operations but given an opportunity with cash on the table, i can explain.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Cars and many other vehicles of modern day will be operated on jet engine once this great idea is actualised and implemented.

> Name of the Innovator

Shadreck sandwe

> Age

- 19-35
