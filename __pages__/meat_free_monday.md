> Description of the solution

Ask residents to go meat-free for just one day a week, as one significant source of pollution is the release of greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide during the process of animal farming. These gases are produced during the digestion process of livestock and are released into the atmosphere through manure storage and application. Consuming more plant-based foods greatly reduces emissions, ultimately leading to cleaner air.
