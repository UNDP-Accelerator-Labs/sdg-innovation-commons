> Title of the innovation

Plant A Tree

> Brief description of the innovation

A climate change digital solution is our innovative solution - a smart management tool and platform for tree planting accountability of trees planted by individuals and organizations and proper planting and follow up care and making tree planting fun. This is a mobile based application that is used to register individuals and organizations planting campaigns, map the geographical locations of where trees are planted, the care which is being provided by digitally monitoring growth and platform provides for undertaking tree planting campaigns- ultimately providing tree planting analytics, including trees planted in a given period of time.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate money through taking a percentage on all digital payments made through the application. The revenue potential is from a market research we undertook which suggests that for every one Kwacha our profit margin is 50 ngwee per tree. It is estimated that 5 000 000 trees can be planted in the next 5 years. Our target market will have a platform to sell, get visibility and have a cashless payment hence improving the efficiency of their operations. The players in the tree value chain include  seed suppliers, transporters, forest extension officers, suppliers of tree planting implements, buyers of tree products. Our market base are the organizations and individuals that would like to start fundraising campaigns This revenue stream will be a 10% commission on each successful fundraising campaign. Other revenue streams will include consultancy fees for capacity building programmes targeted at the individuals and organisations that are into tree planting. This eco inclusiveness in the value chain of tree planting makes the business to be environmentally and economically sustainable in the long term. We require the Challenge prize to finish off the development of the application to be used for the digital selling and payments.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation has a first stage of an android application on playstore for individuals and organizations and a web application for administrative purposes and data analytics. In the next 6 months the application will be introduced to the market, in the next 8 months a second development phase is to be done to add soil pH so as to advise what type of trees to be planted in the different areas, laws concerning planting tree species.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve climate change, food security by planting fruit trees, using trees to farm bees hence ending the cycle of generational poverty by Increasing incomes, building self-sufficiency, promoting entrepreneurship and Local economic resilience. Our approach impacts on a social level: It promotes education by farmers learning valuable farming, life, and technological skills, promoting cultural preservation, youth and women’s empowerment.
