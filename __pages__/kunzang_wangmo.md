## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

How might we engage with social media influencers in the country to reach out to wider audience to advocate the city bus application?  

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we engage with creative and upcoming mode of communication to reach a wider audience THEN there will be an uptake of city bus ridership and increase in mobile application downloads and usage.

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Quality assurance by reviewing script, video length and ensuring task is completed on time.  Time of UNDP comms and Experimenter were involved in completing the assignment.  
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

There was no significant increase in the Gakyid app downloads. However, visibility of The City Bus Services improved substantially with frequency of social media post post social media campaign. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

None 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Three and half months 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 2900

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

s per the experimentation recommendation, City Bus Services officials were trained to continue developing the Gaykid ride by incorporating new route and advocating to the bus commuters, drivers and conductors. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Some of the approach such as involving social media influencers were replicated for Stockholm plus 50. 

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Prior to the experiment, I was not aware that the comms materials were to be uploaded in UNDP page. I was also not aware that UNDP comms and IT personnel were crucial executing the social media campaign. During the course of the campaign, UNDP comms and IT personnel were kind enough to upload the content during their leave and also during lockdown. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

COVID lockdown and getting comms and IT personnel to work during their leave. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP CO and the viewership increased substantially especially amongst the youth by involving social media influencers. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Upcoming social media influencers, youths working as freelance camera operator and video editors.  

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

None 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Involve the social media influencer as individual consultant for the specific assignment. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, some of the approach may be replicated as it is done for the Stockholm plus 50 by the Environment Cluster and UNDP Comms. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

None 

> What surprised you?

Views on the 'Par Sonam Vlog" even though the video quality was not that great.
