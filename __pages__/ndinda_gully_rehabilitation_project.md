> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The Ndinda Chiefdom is one of the most degraded areas characterized by large gullies. Due to the rainfall in the past season and deep soils in the area, the gully has expanded causing rampant erosion in the area. Therefore, the purpose of the solution is to solve the challenges of erosion.  

ACDP development with the support of UNDP revealed the challenges of SLM issues as the main ones. The solution was a result of the needs identified as part of the Chiefdom development process.  This was the biggest danger which needed machinery as the problem is a result of poor drainage. 

The focus here was also aimed for skills transfer as the project involves local labour from the community. The aim is to also fence the place for environmental benefits such as planting of fruit trees and grass to create the necessary ground cover to prevent further erosion.
