> Description of the solution

School Streets is an initiative to transform the roads outside schools so that only pedestrians and cyclists can use them at school drop-off and pick-up times. This way, School Streets can help to improve poor air quality around schools where children are clustered at the start and end of the day. They also make it safer to walk, cycle, and scoot to school, creating a more pleasant environment and giving children a chance to get some exercise. As of July 2023, almost 600 School Streets were in place across London, with more on the way. The initiative is run by Mums for Lungs.

> Socio-economic effects

Enhanced health of school children due to both improved air quality and potentially active mobility. Enhanced safety around schools in terms of traffic.
