Reverse Vending Machine

> Description

In Nepal, the concept of waste seggregation does not exist. Thus, more than 90% of recyclable waste ends up in landfills. The reverse vending machine accepts empty PET bottles or plastic wrappers and inturn rewards the provider with discount coupons or other perks. The collected plastic waste is later upcycled to  produce new products.
