Problem: Population growth, intensive agro-industrial use in the lower part of the basin and pressure on the forest in the upper part have generated a marked decrease in the flows of the Ixtacapa River. In addition to the above, the illegal extraction of wood and firewood, high levels of pollution, forest fires and overgrazing have had a negative impact on the recharge capacity and hydrological regulation of the area.

Solution: It began by consolidating the Association in a legal manner, establishing the statutes and developing a strategic plan for action and then identified the need to protect the upper part of the forest, so technical and economic support was provided to the communities of this region.
