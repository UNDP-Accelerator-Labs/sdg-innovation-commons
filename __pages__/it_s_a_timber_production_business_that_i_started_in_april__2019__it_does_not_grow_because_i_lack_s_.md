> Title of the innovation

It's a Timber Production business that I started in April, 2019. It does not grow because I lack sponsorship, I have a goals of supplying finished products such as Plunks and Household Furniture, but not yet come to reach that goal because my income is too little to pay for a place and open a workshop. But my business is registered with PACRA, under the name THE DEW ENTERPRISE.

> Brief description of the innovation

Basically, I just go into the Jungle, Pay a sum of Not less than K5000 to the Chief of that area, and also pay about a K2000 to the Headman. Sometimes these people request a truckload of timber each.
So timber has to be cut, shaped into a square box, and a tractor has to Drug them to one place. From there, the truck will load and take to Lusaka, where I sell to the Chinese

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Personally, I feel the business will help me generate income to further my career and better my future, most importantly, being able to pay the people who help me get the job done in the bush.
If I win this Challenge, I'll be very happy because it will help me grow the business, I want to open up workshops so that I'm able to employ others and start selling finished products.
My target customers are schools and other public offices, I also want to start export timber to China.
I want to buy machinery like Chainsaws, Woodmizers, Forklift, Tractor, Truck among others, this will help me stop booking these things, and that will reduce the cost and I'll be able to use that money to pay others. Timber is also exported when I sell in Lusaka, so the Government still gets some income from export permits and others, which benefits every citizen.
For others, I feel this will create more Jobs for them, improve infrastructure, furniture in schools and home and others public offices.

> Technical Feasibility

The Procedure is that, I first get a Production license from the Forrest Department before entering the Jungle, from there I have to book a Chainsaw, buy Petrol, 2Stroke, Chains, Foods for the people helping in the Bush, and also Chainsaw Spares.
After that, a Surveyor has to find trees good quality for Timber, 50 Logs makes one Truckload. And then the machine operator will cut them in pieces call Logs, Shape them into a square box.
There after I have to book a Tractor to drug them and hip them together at a place called the Loading Bay.
Later I have to book a Truck to load them, I need to pay the loaders putting them on the Truck. From there I have to go back to the Forrest Department and get a conveyance license and clear a truck, lastly but not the least,vI have to pay council levy and face other expenses on the road until I reach Lusaka.
I always have to spend around K150,000 to K200,000 to get a Truck to Lusaka.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Well, Timber Production will help More youths find Jobs, No person can do this Business without the help of others. Currently I have a Surveyor, Machine Operator and a Motorcyclist to help me get the job done, so they get paid and feed their families. Truck Owners and Drivers also have a share when we book them, and the Government gets road taxes and fees that we're changed for obtain a business license and clearing a Truck through the Forest Department. Timber is also exported when I sell in Lusaka, so the Government still gets some income from export permits and others, which benefits every citizen.
All in all, everyone is benefitting.
