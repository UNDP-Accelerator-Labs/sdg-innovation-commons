> Description of the solution

In line with what community groups have asked for, the city should update the heat-related mortality data it uses and expand the indicators it uses to measure heat-related mortality and heat vulnerability. The City should also reassess what varibales it uses to create a heat index by considering other data sources for temperature and the built environment, such as humidity and building material type. This will help improve the accuracy and specificity of the heat Vulnerability Index tool and allow the city and researchers to make program and funding decisions that better target heat-vulnerable communities.
