> Title of the innovation

Modernization and development of rural areas using local materials within the environment

> Brief description of the innovation

The presence of hunger, poverty and poor living conditions in rural areas despite the availability of land and resources leaves much to be desired. This therefore forces the able bodied youths to leave these areas in search of greener pastures. To alleviate these challenges, we would like to work with the youths using the environment they live in with the resources therein to develope and modernize the rural areas and give them hope of advancement and success. We would also like to work with women to encourage the adoption and incorporation of diverse foods for a healthy community by promoting diverse and organic farming using cost effective methods.

To achieve this, we would like to create a platform that avails agricultural inputs, machinery and skills training through membership and encouraging a ripple effect to the neighboring communities.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

A) Income generation:- contributions from members for agricultural inputs, skills training and use of agricultural equipment.
- selling of the demo farm products
- providing agency services for the member's products.

B) Target market :- the local residents themselves
- public central markets, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants, hospitals and schools, events, etc.

C) Value addition on the environment:- modernization of environment through building of modern infrastructure, energy generation and water systems.
- promotion of cleanliness through modern infrastructure and recycling of products.
- promotion of a peaceful community due to change of mindset through skills training, improved diet and time for creativity.
- contribution to national development through new agricultural methods and infrastructure.

The challenge prize will enable implementation of this innovation as it will be the capital to offset the project.

> Technical Feasibility

The initial design of this innovation requires input of financial capital, land, seed, machinery and labor which will be employed as follows:-

1) Capital for acquisition of land and infrastructure building, seed and machinery and salaries for labor.

2) Land will house office infrastructure and demo farm.

3) Machinery for income generation and capacity building.

4) Seed for the introduction of diverse farming and provision of seed to members

5) Labor for operation of machinery and running of the organization.

The expected outputs in this innovation are:- an increase in diverse products on the market
- development and appreciation of the innovation.
- contribution to the national food basket
- overflow of diverse food on the tables of the families in the community
- improvement of health in the community.

Implementation Plan :- sourcing of capital for the acquisition of land and building infrastructure.
- acquisition of machinery :-
A) 2 tractors and accessories for cultivation.
B) 2 harvestors and accessories for quicker and effective harvesting of crops.
C) water drilling machine for the creation of water systems to promote all year farming.
D) 2 oil expellers and accessories for for production of oil, stock feed and other by-products
E) 2 canters to provide transportation for products for members.

- acquisition of seed
- advertise the organization to the local residents through the headman and sign up members.
- first work on demo farm i.e developing infrastructure and cultivation.
- avail machinery to the members for land development.
- then start training for farmers and gradually introduce organic farming.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will help improve the lives if locals through increase of crop production due to availability of machinery.
- the members will be self sustained due to diverse farm produce.
- introduction of machinery will reduce manual work for the members giving them enough time for rest and creativity, and acquisition of self improvement skills.
- improvement of health due to nutritional education.
-introduction of decent housing and infrastructure, energy and water systems will improve their well being, security and productivity.

Relevance to the market:- due to increase of productivity this will cover the insufficient food supply on the market.
- it will bring diversity and affordability of food on the market to the locals
