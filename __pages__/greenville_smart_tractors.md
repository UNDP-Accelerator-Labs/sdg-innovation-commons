> Title of the innovation

Greenville Smart Tractors

> Brief description of the innovation

A Tractor sharing platform that is designed mechanize agriculture in Zambia and subsaharan Africa by bringing tractors to populations that need them the most through the collaborative consumption or the gig economy

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Small holder farmers are by definition resource poor and they can't afford to purchase tractors for ploughing, so by making them have access to a tractor that is as good as owning one, further more seed and fertilizer companies as well as investment Banks will become core patners for obvious reasons, income will be generated from the cultivation of high value cash crops like marijuana

> Technical Feasibility

Each tractor is fitted with a special tracking device, the GPS device is able to tell the tractor owner where there tractor is at all times, whether it is idle or not and the number of hectors it has ploughed, there is a full audit trail, the tractor owner can then assign a tractor operator to that tractor, when a farmer needs a tractor they just send a request through our platform, soon the tractor will arrive and provide a service that is forty times more efficient than the cost of manual labor

> Anticipated Social Impact

Mechanized agriculture for all small holder farmers, farmers will be able to plant forty times faster, use the land that is mostly sitting dormant, make agriculture a more viable investment option for the youth
