I have done poultry nutrition and l know feed formulation which will make the cost of production cheaper. Thuse our selling prices will be competitive ,and give the group enough profit. We always have a shortage of poultry products in kitwe. This will make it more marketable.

We would like to start with 500_1000 broilers. We will divide bird's in half .We  bring in half then the other half to be brought after three weeks. These will allow us have a continuous supply of the products on the market. 6 people will be on production and 4 will be on marketing.
