## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The activity aims to develop the most effective method for collecting and providing information on the accessibility of cities for people with disabilities. To this end, key accessibility parameters will be identified using focus groups of people with different types of disabilities.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the method is correct, then accurate data will be collected and more people will use the digital map to get information

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The data collected is verified by the citizens. If the information is not correct, any citizen can leave a comment through the mobile application and attach a photo as proof.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

n/a

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data are collected based on the methodology developed, in which volunteers rate the accessibility of buildings based on five key parameters: main entrance, elevator, toilet, navigation, and indoor mobility. Each parameter has a number of sub-parameters that allow for a more detailed assessment. For example, the main entrance parameter consists of evaluating the availability of call buttons, wheelchair lift requirements, accessible ramp, stairs, doors, and tambour. Volunteers use a special digital tool to enter data and save photos. The data is then integrated into the 2GIS platform, which visualises it on geospatial data.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

18 weeks in total: 6 weeks for focus groups and methodology + 12 weeks for city assessment

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
