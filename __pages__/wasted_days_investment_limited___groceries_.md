Wasted days investment Limited ( Groceries)

> Brief description of the innovation

I completed my secondary education in the year 2016, after School I stayed with my brother at his house for a year without gaining any little amount of money. Then it came to my minds that I don't have to stay just like that.

I started this business in the year 2018 as a chips seller, I bought some potatoes for ten kwacha (k10).
Since my brother was dealing with a grocery I good cooking oil for k10 on credit with the zeal of paying back whenever my chips are finished. As I continued selling the chips the business was quite encouraging such that within one week I managed to start buying a 10kg bag of potatoes costing k35, a bottle of cooking oil k12 and charcoal for k 6, packing papers for k20. 

Due to the increase of the number of customers who were coming to buy my chips in 6 working days in a week I used to finish 10 by 10 bags of potatoes, in a week I used to get a profit of about three hundred kwacha ( k300) 

In the year 2019 I thought of changing the business for most of the youths started making some chips within the same market I have been working from that's how I opened up grocery of which from the grocery I managed to buy a plot were I managed to build a two roomed house. the plot costed me k6500.

My encouragement to my fellow young people out there is that, in everything you do you just have to have confidence and believe that one day you will make it.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My target in this business is to make this business grow from one worker to a good number of workers. 
If given enough funds and make this company grow it will be a company were the prices will be low so that we can help everyone who comes to buy from this company. There are people who are unable to buy things from other parts of the market because of high prices, but my business is there to help the vulnerable in the society who can not be able to by a loaf of bread at k16 but am giving them at k14 so that, that k2 they can use it to buy something. 

If this company grows it can be a company were people will be treated equally so that everyone who buys from us can feel at home and a company to  trust in the market for having affordable goods and low prices.

This company if funded I can create jobs to the youths so that we reduce theft case in the community by providing to my fellow young youths something to do, than just moving up and down to and fro in the community.
The more the customers are increasing in number the more the income can increase for this company it's first  priority is a customer for I depend on the customers, if there are no customers meaning they will be no business.
Treatment of customers also matters as is stated earlier on that customers must feel at home and received with a warm welcome .
The vision is to see this business grow and provide an opportunity to others to  learn from it.

The plan for this company is see many young people get inspired through how it started till where it is now.
So that we can all be creative thinkers

> Anticipated Social Impact

Many people suffer from high prices if this grocery is closed. Many people are happy the way customers are being helped and welcomed.
