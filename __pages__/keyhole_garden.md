A keyhole garden works on a similar principle to tower gardens, in that it is a stacked structure with a central cavity in which vegetable food waste is placed together with water or grey water . The walls of the keyhole garden are constructed from similar materials to tower gardens, but they are generally larger in diameter, with an access point (keyhole) to reach the central cavity. In keyhole gardens, vegetable crops are generally grown only at the top of the structure.
