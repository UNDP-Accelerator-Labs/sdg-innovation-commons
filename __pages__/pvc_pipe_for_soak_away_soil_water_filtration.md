> Brief description of the innovation

Basically the invention tries to use non cement and blocks for the construction of the soak away.  A merely use of a 110diameter PVC soil pipe, which is perforated then firmly allowing it to stand vertically and then surgically using selected waste rocks stacking them around the whole upright PVC soil pipe to the desired height then cover appropriately on top to avoid soil/silt filling the air pockets around the sprocket or stones.  This system allows quick construction of waste water without any use of concrete blocks or cement.  This makes this invention easy to set up and allow many to have point source intervention from polluting the environment due to costs or lack of cement in far places.  But a PVC pipe can easily be transported unlike cement and blocks to remote or rural places.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It's a very green project in the sense that it is cutting down on it carbon footprint with almost no use of cement and concrete blocks thereby having a huge positive impact on the environment.  The use of PVC pipes drug to their longevity in use has relatively low damage in the areas they will be used in this instance.

> Technical Feasibility

It is based the the similar knowledge of solid waste disposal.  But this design prototype will make it ease for house holds to develop water portable toilets at minimal costs.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This will spontaneously have a huge positive impact as it will be an ideal option for household developers to adopt.
