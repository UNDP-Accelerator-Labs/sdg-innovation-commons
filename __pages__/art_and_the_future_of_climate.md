The Future of Climate in Iraq Exhibition is an art exhibition that invites new players in the community to think about the future, grasp the aspiration of the Iraqi community in response to climate change challenges and share their own perception of the climate they want to see in Iraq in the long-term using visual art. This participatory future approach will invite people to avoid short-termism and think in the long-term as well as engage the public through creating the purpose to start impacting decision-making and identifying local solutions that are aligned with the local community priorities.  This exhibition aims to build the capacities of the Iraqi local community to think long-term and participate in drawing the future they want, and throughout the whole process unite people, give them hope, and a shared identity about the future they want.  Goals: The sensing initiatives aim to engage people through online submissions to scan, sense, explore and forecast the future of climate and mainly: -          Change the way of thinking of the Iraqi local community to think long-term and participate in drawing the future they want through art. -          Engaging more people and new players in thinking about the future will lead to startups that satisfy market needs and better decision making. The initiative does not target only experts and decision-makers but target the local Iraqi community in order to avoid cognitive bias and groupthink. -          The future thinking participatory approach helps the implementers of the initiative to: -          Show “blind spots” that are not included in our research.  -          Harness collective intelligence of the future -          Analyze change in a specific issue over time -          Spur ideas and knowledge that help in drawing out potential futures and achieve that through promoting collective actions in the present. -          This approach will engage citizens in long-term thinking about climate change and inform the Accelerator Lab and partners next steps when analyzing the challenges and drawing the portfolio of solutions. -          Imagining the future solutions for the climate challenges in order to help the implementers to direct and dig deep to shape the current solutions to match the future needs. -          Supporting the UNDP Environment Energy and Climate Change pillar (EECC) and the partners to have another point of view from the community level to tackle the challenges by bringing the community priorities on the table. -          Brining new players to have a voice; minds in the margins are not marginal minds! Giving the voice to artists. -          Using unusual and new data sources and analysis to provide input for UNDP and partners. -          Identifying the prioritizes of the local communities in order to support in building local solutions, startups, around them.
