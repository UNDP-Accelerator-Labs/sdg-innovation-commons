## Title

DIGITAL NEIGHBORHOOD
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the pandemic-driven social distancing has impacted trust between vulnerable neighborhood residents, reducing their ability to collaborate towards communal solutions and citizen participation for better decision making

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

"Based on the analysis of the deprivations of demographic and socioeconomic information in the municipality of La Paz and the evaluation of progress in achieving the SDGs, in 2019 the Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz (GAMLP) designed a municipal plan with three multidimensional guidelines: i) Healthy living, ii) Inclusive urban mobility and iii) Decent work. Within the framework of the last two guidelines, the Accelerator Lab of UNDP Bolivia identified a sinergy with the GAMLP specifically with the "Barrios de Verdad" Program, which has been active since 2005 with the aim of transforming neighborhoods and communities with more dignified conditions, less vulnerable to natural and social risks, with quality basic services and with solid organizations in interaction with institutions legitimized by their efficiency in public management. Jointly with the "Barrios de Verdad" Program, the Accelerator Lab analyzed socioeconomic and demographic information identifying 5 potential neighborhoods , from which it was decided to explore the Barrio 110 Villa "San Sebastián". It is a neighborhood with 795 inhabitants, 396 are men and 399 women. Additionally, more than 45% of population is young people, according to the 2019 Municipality survey.

> 

A signal of weak social cohesion was the fact that women and youth did not participate in regular meetings of the neighborhood. Besides, citizens did not have enough information to make decisions about the neighborhood, so it was so difficult to identify common needs and goals.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The pandemic deepened social and economic problems and the neighborhood of San Sebastian was not the exception. The situation in San Sebastian was very complex and a systemic analysis was needed in order to have an integral and shared vision of the problems. Furthermore, co-creation was the only way for citizens to identify feasible solutions. Since our Acc Lab works with these tools, we were the perfect actor to face this challenge. The process began with a characterization of the neighborhood, identifying their needs, including strengthening their social cohesion, new job and entrepreneurship opportunities, and communal communication. Neighbors also mentioned the need for Internet access, digital education services, and technical training. Through co-creation, social cohesion and a reduction of the technological gap using digital tools were linked taking advantage of 45% of people under 25 years old. To implement the Digital Neighborhood experiment, citizens especially women and youth were trained to use technological tools to facilitate citizen participation toward effective decision-making. Young people of San Sebastian gathered information using digital tools as input to prioritize goals and activities for the neighborhood. Furthermore, citizens realized the importance of having a place where youth could access to the internet and digital tools. As a consequence, they decided to install and maintain an internet cafe in the neighborhood. "
