> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Mauritanians eat a lot of meat. Animals are either slaughtered at home or at a slaughter house. The hides and skins of these animals are normally left to perish which causes a lot of pollution. Since a local market for raw hides and skins hardly exists in Mauritania, some groups of people are using these hides and skins to make local traditional products. The most prominent locally produced product from hides is the “Lekshat”. Lekshat is a local traditional leather belt used by men in Mauritania to tie the Sirwal (aerated baggy pant).  The “Sirwal” goes with the Moorish boubou or Drâa which is a kind of long sheet with a hole in order to let the passage of the head, with two large opened sleeves in each side. In summer time, when it is very hot, sleeves can be rolled up until shoulders. Pockets are sewed in each side to allow men to put their personal effects in. Boubou can be worn on top of a “Sirwal”. The “Lekshat” and Sirwal is a long standing traditional dress by men in Mauritania.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

This helps to ameliorate situations where people have nothing meaningful to engage in within their communities, by creating opportunities through the utilization of available unwanted resources in the community such as animal hides and skins. It helps to foster a safer and more prosperous country where people are seen as active player in moving their own developmental plans forward in partnership with like-minds. It’s also, a source of livelihood and empowerment from community waste.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

There is greater socio-economic potential in the hides and skins value chain that could be exploited by establishing a modern production enterprise and take advantage of the opportunity. Leather is probably the most ancient fabric used by humans, and it’s a multi-billion dollar global industry. Demand for leather goods is growing but so is criticism of its severe environmental impact, which is driving a keen interest in sustainable alternatives.
