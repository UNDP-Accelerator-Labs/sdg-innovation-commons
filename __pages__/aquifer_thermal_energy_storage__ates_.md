> Description of the solution

ATES is the storage and recovery of thermal energy underground. ATES is applied to heat and cool buildings. More than 30% of Germany's final energy consumption currently results from thermal energy for heating and cooling in the building sector. One possibility to achieve significant greenhouse gas emission savings in space heating and cooling is the application of¬†aquifer thermal energy storage¬†(ATES) systems.
