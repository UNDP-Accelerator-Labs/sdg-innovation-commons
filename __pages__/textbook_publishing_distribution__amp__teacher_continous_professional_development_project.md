> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Each school shall pay annual subscription fee of K1, 000.00 for using the book. based on the 3, 000 secondary schools around the country, our business shall have the annual turnover of three million kwacha (K3, 000, 000.00). Our online research has also identified an international market of 30 countries in Africa. If the book sales to 3000 schools per country, a total of 90, 000 clients could be realized, with a potential Forex earnings of USD 409, 090.91 per year.

> Technical Feasibility

1. Print 5000 books minimum.
2. Distribute the Books to Schools, 
3. At the time of distribution sign contract with school management for annual subscription and collect the first payment.4. Set-up direct debt with Bankers of the client
5. Conduct annual seminar to Teacher CPD online or onsite

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Zambian government developed a curriculum on "computer studies", meant for senior secondary schools in 2012. Nine years has passed without the needed textbooks, to support to teaching of the subject in schools. This book will be a vital teaching and learning tool for both teachers and pupils. This will help 3000 schools, with approximately, 150,000 pupils per year,  who are currently not learning the subject around the country. This shall ultimately reduce ICT illiteracy levels among our youths and their teacher.
