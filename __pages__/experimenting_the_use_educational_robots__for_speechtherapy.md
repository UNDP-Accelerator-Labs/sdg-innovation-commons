## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

The success of using robots for speech therapy in Rwanda will depend on careful planning, adaptation, and ongoing evaluation and hence repurpose the robots used during covid 19 response.

It is important to involve therapists, patients, and other stakeholders in the development and implementation of robot-assisted therapy.

Robots should be seen as a tool to supplement, not replace, human therapists.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The UNDP along with the partnership with ZoraBots Africa, a robotic and

AI based company and Silver Bells School, established a program of

introducing humanoid robots to assist and help children with speech and

language problems(autism and downsyndrome).
