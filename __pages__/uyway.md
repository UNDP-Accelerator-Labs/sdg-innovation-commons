> Description

The 'Empowerment Program for Elderly Women Weavers' is an initiative focused on providing support and opportunities to elderly artisan grandmothers who possess unique skills in hand weaving. The main objective of this program is to reactivate the economy of these older women by providing them with resources, training, and access to specialized markets for the commercialization of their creations, specifically baby textiles. Distribution takes place in specialized stores with which partnerships have been established, facilitating the placement and sale of the products woven by the grandmothers in these spaces.


After the sale of the products, payment is made to the grandmother weavers according to a fair and transparent scheme that recognizes their work and contribution to the empowerment program. Additionally, UYWAY is responsible for acquiring the necessary materials for the production of the textiles, ensuring their quality and facilitating access for grandmothers who may have mobility issues or limited resources.
