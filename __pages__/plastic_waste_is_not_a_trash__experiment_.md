## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. If separation infrastructure is provided to the population, they are ready to separate the plastic waste. 2. There is a difference in the level of engagement from the population in Tbilisi (capital city) and Batumi (2nd largest city, region). detailed analysis of the experiment and the final report will be ready in mid February.   3. We placed transparent bins for the collection of the plastic waste. initially the municipality was against the transparent bins and wanted to place the regular bins. however, the experiment demonstrated that the transparent bins  contributed to the increased quality of the collected waste.  4. collected waste in transparent bins placed near the households have 30-40% better quality of collected waste than in closed bins placed in public spaces. overall, during 7 weeks 730kg of plastic waste was collected in Batumi and 1.2 tons in Tbilisi.  5. There is a huge interest towards the topic among the population. Lab did not post anything on social media to avoid the spillover effect of the experiment, however the photos of the bins appeared in multiple social media groups and digital media itself.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. initially we announced the call for proposals to issue the grant to the NGO, however after the winner was announced we found out that since the Lab is an engagement facility we are not allowed to issue grants and we had to change the contracting modality which took additional 2-3 weeks.  2. Lab was forced to postpone events and activities due to Covid

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We were planning a behavioral experiment, which required the analysis of available literature and citizen habits. the chosen methods helped us understand the existing barriers and perceptions of households towards the separation of plastic waste. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We wanted to test different messages and the RCT using the behavioral insights was the best methodology to be used. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Spectri, Parki ar Minda (I don't want a plastic bag), Chaobi  - consortium of NGOs contracted for the implementation of the experiment.  Packaging Cluster  - association of packaging industry representatives. AccLab consulted with them to find out their strategy towards the increased producer responsibility obligations. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

BISC - Behavioral Insights Strategy and Communication partners - supported the Lab with behavioral insights methodology review.  

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Tbilisi City Hall and Batumi City Hall - signed MoU with moth municipalities to implement the experiment in these cities.  LTD Tbilservice Group and Sandasuftaveba - Municipality owned waste service providers - responsible for the collection of the waste. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Parki ar Minda, Chaobi and BISC were new partners for the UNDP. for Parki ar Minda, it was one of the first large projects, since they are a new organization oriented on waste topics, therefore they were ready to take an extra effort to ensure that the experiment is successful. Chaobi is a regional organization that provided insights into the local situation in Batumi.  BISC provided high-quality behavioural insights consultancy, which compared to the famous BIT was significantly chapter, however, the quality of work, performed by BISC was similar, in not better than BIT. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

AccLab partnered with EU supported UNDP Project "Innovation Action for private sector competitiveness" focused on the engagement of main plastic producers and users (coca-cola etc.) in the waste problem resolution. Mentioned project is interested to scale the experiment in other cities.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

NA
