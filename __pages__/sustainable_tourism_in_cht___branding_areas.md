1.    Tourists visiting the CHT region often do not know the specific unique features of the areas they are seeing, which makes the areas less interesting than they could be. There is scope to innovate via sub district level branding of specific areas such as Thanchi to introduce those areas to potential tourists, highlighting the specific attributes of those areas. The best practices and good practices from different locations should be identified and replicated in other locations. The picture shows a discussion organized by the Accelerator Lab on this topic with the local government representatives and the tour operators association of Cox Bazaar.
