YOUTH EMPOWERMENT AND INNOVATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT:    A Center for technology and innovation for fresh graduates and school leavers.

> Brief description of the innovation

The plan is to capture fresh graduates from universities/colleges and school leavers, mobilize them and allow them to create individual as well as corporate enterprises that innovate ways of implementing new technology in agriculture, education, and climate change. The initiative will involve building a cooperation of youths who will contribute to national development while running SMEs. The innovation and technology wings will incorporate raising awareness on digital migration, research, and orienting upcoming entrepreneurs on how to grow their businesses. The extra support will be to link these young local entrepreneurs with local authorities such as PACRA, ZRA, and ZPPA to guide them on local procedures, while at the same time connecting them to other prosperous business people. I will be a platform upon which ambitious youths can sale their ideas and translate them into workable solutions that can earn them an income.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Agriculture: the idea is to allow the youths to come up with new but practical ways of improving agriculture. For instance, coming up with bio-technical solutions and opportunities with small and medium scale farmers, facilitating the soliciting of implements and loan schemes, the use of natural fertilizer and conservation agriculture methods. 
This team will comprise a technical think tank whose responsibility will mainly be to innovate, monitor and evaluate the innovations. As more solutions are created the cooperation will convert it's intellectual product into marketable solutions that can be used by the agriculture sector. Also it will usher some of it's members into various institutions and companies to pioneer the implementation of the solutions.
Out of whatever solutions are sold, the returns are deposited into the company account and redistributed at the appropriate time. The monies are then reinvested into person businesses. It will be the task of the team leaders to only sustain members who run any form of business.

Education and Climate Change: the innovation will also encapsulate the implementation of ESD and climate change solutions in schools and communities. This branch will recruit school leavers and climate change ambassadors to work alongside ZEMA, LCC, and NGOs such as WWF, Plan International and WECSZ. Much of the funding will be solicited from partners and donor agencies for the start but these will be reinvested in the company businesses in order to continue to grow and expand.

> Technical Feasibility

There will be a center with computers and internet facility where the youths including the differently abled will be enrolled at affordable costs and made to innovate ways of enhancing agriculture, ESD and Climate Change solutions using their acquired knowledge and skills. The focal point areas of focus will be agriculture, education, and climate change. The center is purported to be located in Lusaka. In order to facilitate its commencement, the innovators will liaise with managers of Kalingalinga Youth Resource Center, Kabulonga Youth Resource Center and Kalingalinga Community Center. These are the possible places where the location for the operations can begin. Also the potential  graduates and school leavers can be identifies and recruited from these places. 
Springboard: there is already a program underway to facilitate the implementation of ESD, digital literacy and migration at Kabulonga Girls secondary school. There are workshops where presentation platforms for innovative solutions will be done by pupils and school leavers. This program is being done in partnership with plan international and WWF.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation is prying on enhancement of methods of improving the current agriculture practices. It will contribute latest solutions to eminent challenges due to fundamental changes that have affected the field.

It will consolidate and expand the linking agribusiness with emergent farmers so as to increase the number of commercial farmers.

The agriculture sector will see an increase in production and this will translate into food security for people. The cost of food will decrease hence increasing affordability.

The unemployed youths will become employed both through the cooperation and through the opportunities created in the existing institutions by the innovations.

There will be reduced vice and possibilities of crime as many energetic people will channel their mental and physical energies to innovation and profitable work.

Young women and girls will be empowered through their engagement in ESD programmes that will open up possibilities of running their own businesses right from school.

When climate change solutions are enforced, the clean and green environment will create a healthy and harmonious environment for  everyone. This will reduce mortality and increase life expectancy.
