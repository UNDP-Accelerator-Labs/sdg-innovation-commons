This dehumidification system is a solar collector system that incorporates storage system, generation and regeneration absorption, and drying chamber. The drying chamber can be maintained at a stable temperature and the relative humidity for drying is of high quality. The herbs that have been dried using the solar dryer have been tested to contain many of their active ingredients after the drying process. This system is suitable for herb and agriculture produce drying.
