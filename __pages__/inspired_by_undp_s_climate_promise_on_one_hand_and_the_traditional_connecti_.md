## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Inspired by UNDP’s Climate Promise on the one hand and the traditional connection of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to their natural environment, the Accelerator Lab set out in late 2019 to explore practical ways in which climate action can be ignited and brought closer to the people. This is what we have learned so far: 

1. To answer the need for a broad awareness and action at scale, it became obvious a digital solution would need to be deployed, and more attention given at the outset to the mere understanding of the climate urgency. For this purpose, the first phase of the TvojCO2.ba platform of June 2020 consisted of a release of an engaging carbon footprint calculator for individuals and companies, that compared everyone’s footprint results with the national average and provided a set of recommendations on how to minimize one’s impact on the environment and climate. In parallel, we surveyed the users of the calculator (individuals and companies) to get a sense of their motivation to take climate action and concrete ways in which they would prefer to lower their carbon footprint. Somewhat surprisingly, 100% of those surveyed thought that not enough was done on climate change and air quality in the country and that awareness on these issues was very low. Besides separate waste collection, which is correlated with a growing awareness of the municipal waste mismanagement in the country, the second most preferred option for personal and corporate climate action was – planting trees. Coincidentally, safeguarding old forests and planting new ones are among key ways in which societies can contribute to carbon removal from the atmosphere and mitigation of negative effects of climate change, such heatwaves and floods. This was well recognized in the "Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use" endorsed by Bosnia and Herzegovina and a dozen of other countries at the COP26 climate summit last year. Although more than half of the country’s territory is under forest cover, forests in Bosnia and Herzegovina are in decline. Among other factors, the forests are heavily impacted by wildfires and at-scale restoration efforts are lacking. At the same time, trees are important carbon sinks, and when healthy, significantly contribute to climate change mitigation. CO2 emissions per capita in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2021 are estimated to be 6.7 tons. For the capture of 1 ton of CO2 emissions, 50 trees must grow for one year. As the United Nations Digital Financing Task Force in their report “People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future” rightfully noticed, citizens (and their businesses) are those ultimate owners of the world’s income and wealth. Tens of billions of decisions every day determine what and how we produce and consume, today and into the future. However, we see that citizens’ spending behaviors often do not reflect their legitimate concerns about their and their children's futures, specifically regarding the environment and climate change. In many cases, it is just because of a lack of services that would allow citizens to direct their money for effective sustainable development action. Our goal was to overcome barriers to securing financing for this kind of climate action. 

2. The next step for the platform development to achieve the desired impact was to offer trees for online purchase to allow everyone who calculated their carbon footprint to immediately offset a part of it and quickly and conveniently take part in maintaining forest health and combating climate change. Further on, since volunteering for climate positive actions also scored high in our survey, TvojCO2.ba also expanded its functionalities towards an event organization and management segment. Registered users can, therefore, follow their positive effect on climate through both the tons of CO2 absorbed by the trees purchased through the platform and the number of hours volunteered for the climate. 

3. Motivation is helped in this case by a mixture of factors: 1. convenience and speed – everyone could do something good for the environment and climate from their armchair, in less than 5 minutes; 2. low cost – tree seedlings offered at the platform had a wide range of prices: from less than a dollar for young, common seedlings to more than a hundred dollars for grown-up trees and rare species; 3. there is a clear recognition of the effort in the form of the CO2 offsetting certificate the buyer receives after each purchase of trees or volunteering. 4. After the e-commerce and event organization features of the TvojCO2.ba platform were developed, the next important thing was to ensure that the platform is a trustworthy digital space where people will feel safe to spend their money or time. To ensure this, but also to faster connect demand from the public and supply from plant nurseries, the first batch of partners that offered their seedlings at the platform were either public forestry companies from across the country or urban greenery departments of local administrations. Both types of companies had to have their own plant nursing capacities and the mandate to plant trees at public lands and undergo a rigorous risk assessment procedure, to become platform vendors.  This was also the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina that this type of public companies was introduced to e-commerce and opened up its stock to the entire population of the country, online. Furthermore, a clear set of follow up correspondence steps was set up to build trust in the way the platform functions and to codify and establish functional communication between the supply and demand sides of the process. We will list here the key results of the first, test tree planting campaign we held via our carbon offsetting platform in the fall of 2021: Vendors: Out of 41 mapped potential partners to the platform (communal and forestry companies), 7 public companies have signed partnership agreements with UNDP and thus digitalized part of their business operations through selling their seedlings at the platform’s carbon offset marketplace. Those vendors represent national pioneers in this regard, and have achieved, some more than others, a significant financial result when the campaign ended. 6 vendors showed interest to continue this collaboration, whereas one had difficulties with ensuring suitable planting locations and will probably withdraw from the platform. Biodiversity: The diversity of the seedlings offered was significant at 17 different species available for purchase. Most of them represented native species adapted to the conditions of planting locations, and a portion of trees offered were ornamental species used for landscaping in urban environments. Geographical coverage: Each vendor selected a limited number of planting locations where all seedlings bought through the platform were planted. The test campaign saw 34 different locations with new trees planted, available for review in this map. Although limited in geographical representativeness as this campaign was involving a rather small number of public companies that have a specific areal scope of work, the team has learned a lot in terms of differences in approach when it comes to planting in forests or natural vs. urban areas and the heightened public interest in locations that tell a story (those ravaged by forest fires, or in neighborhoods where someone has grown up). Trees and buyers: A total of 17,322 tree seedlings were purchased through the platform in less than three months of the autumn test campaign, by 132 individuals and 38 companies. We learned that individuals are mostly opting for one or several grown-up and more expensive seedlings to be planted in their neighbourhoods, while companies are going for the larger numbers of cheaper ones to be planted in rural areas, resulting in more than 80% of the total trees being bought by the private sector. This combination proved to be quite beneficial for the platform’s operations since all vendors could profit and raise their profile among the public and the private sector. All buyers showed quite a significant interest in the carbon offsetting certificates issued by the platform’s system. Some even gifted them to their loved ones, and companies usually used the certificates for their corporate social and environmental responsibility function and marketing. Assurance of maintaining plants for 12 months and replacing a plant free of charge in case of unsuccessful planting was important for buyers of trees in urban areas.

Climate impact: The trees planted in the first campaign through TvojCO2.ba will absorb over 20 kilotons of CO2 in their lifetime. For comparison, that is the amount of CO2 that 10,000 cars on gasoline produce on average in a year. Also, the newly planted trees will restore a large natural area burned by wildfires thus contributing to the area’s climate resilience and a boost in biodiversity. 116 mature trees planted in the urban environment of the capital of Sarajevo through the platform will contribute to lower air pollution in the city, cool down hot urban areas during increasingly warm summers and have a significant aesthetic impact on generally neglected apartment blocks in the city. However, the most important effect is probably on building awareness of the positive effects of tree planting. Accidently or not, at the very end of our campaign, the Government of Canton Sarajevo decided to finance the reforestation by planting an additional 500.000 seedlings in rural areas of the Canton.

Outreach and public awareness: TvojCO2.ba is the second result for "carbon footprint" Google search in the local language, after the eponymous Wikipedia article. Google Search showed the platform 6,480 times in the test period of 2.5 months. The total number of platform users in the test period was 16,253, indicating a high public interest in the idea but a somewhat low conversion rate for tree purchases, possibly due to a low purchasing power of the audience or other factors such as limited geographic coverage of the initial campaign and the available payment modality. The number of open pages on the platform in this period was 159,000, and over 80% of users accessed the platform through a mobile device. Most users came from 5 urban centers in the country (Sarajevo with over 6,000 users was leading, followed by Banja Luka, Tuzla, Zenica and Mostar).

The blog on the experiment is still in drafting. We can update the form once it's been cleared and published. The platform can be explored at www.tvojCO2.ba

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. Institutional barriers: Climate action is still perceived as something out of the reach of every day actions and ordinary people. Institutions in charge also showed little interest in supporting our experimentation with climate action. 

2. Digital literacy: Although we started the development of the online marketplace just as the pandemic was unfolding and life quickly became more digitalized, e-commerce is still not equally endorsed by all demographic groups. 

3. Fear of novelty: The CO liked the experiment but didn't really step up to support the test campaign or the comms efforts when it was launched.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The entire solution was developed based on collective intelligence and behavioral insights methods. We tracked its development and success using surveys, customer observation, google analytics  and social media data.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective Intelligence and participatory design helped us create a solution that would be inclusive and will nudge several leverage points in the system we were observing. The pilot was developed and tested and for this we are currently developing a PoC.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with a number of local CSOs mostly while preparing the design and promoting the solution. The growth phase will see more direct involvement of targeted CSOs in the platform work.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have worked with several faculties of forestry in the country while preparing the tree seedling online marketplace.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have established formal partnerships with 6 platform vendors and have mapped over 40 potential ones.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The solution was presented on several occasions to institutional partners dealing with the environment and climate in the country but no particular interest was shown from their side.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The sole number of vendors (forestry companies, urban greenery utilities etc.) that we have made official partners to the platform and digitalized their business operations is unseen in our CO.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The RCO was quite interested in the solution and colleagues participated in the test planting campaign.
