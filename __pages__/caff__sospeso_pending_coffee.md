It is a practice born in Naples, Italy, where coffee shop consumers pay in advance a cup of coffee for any poor person who can enter the shop asking for a cup of coffee. It promotes solidarity and the tradition has grown to other cities and countries where meals can also be "suspended". An anonymous citizen charity practice to combat hunger during economic crisis.
