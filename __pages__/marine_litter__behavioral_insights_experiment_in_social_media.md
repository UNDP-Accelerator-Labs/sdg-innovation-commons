## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiment is part of a broader effort to design a communication strategy on the issue of marine litter, solid waste management, and sustainable consumption (a) social listening to sense consumer sentiments; (b) understand the "user journey" or life cycle of a person shifting towards a sustainable lifestyle, and (c) test how different social media messages could be effective in facilitating the shift. This specific activity pertains to learning objective (c), limited further to testing for messages that could drive engagement as the first stage to potentially enroll audiences into a behavior change campaign. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

BROAD (on Socia &amp; Behavioral Campaigns): IF people's sentiments and practices are used to inform "nudge" campaigns THEN the shift to a zero-waste life can be made more accessible to all.

SPECIFIC (to this experiment): IF social media messages that (a) emphasize social accountability and (b) collective action are delivered to people in the right age groups THEN more people will engage such messages, opening the possibility to entice them into deeper action towards a sustainable lifestyle. "

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

This experiment is part 3 of a broader activity for the design of a communication campaign to promote zero-waste behaviors against marine litter (see above). An experience design firm (KindMind) was tapped to support the whole activity from undertaking a sensing activity to preparing a proposed communication strategy. To test the latter, KindMind and ALab PH prepared the broad experiment design,  executed the social media campaign and A/B test, undertake analysis, and prepare recommendations for the way forward. Two ad variants were pitted against each other: (a) one emphasizing social responsibility and (b) another focusing on collective action.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

social media users (individual)

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Facebook has an experimentation or A/B Test feature for the placement of ads. We used this to set up a head-to-head test of the two ads with four legs each representing four age groups. About US$500 in advertisments were placed. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Staff time (ALab heads and communication consultant), "Clean Seas Pilipinas" Facebook Page, Canva (online content design app). Note on cost: it includes the professional fees of the consulting firm tapped for the whole endeavor and the social media ad placements. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, sort of. Of the two variants tested, the ad emphasizing collective action (b) garnered a higher overall engagement rate, particularly among the youth. The ad emphasizing social responsibility (b) appealed to the older age groups more, although engagement by the youth dominated both ads. The age groups behaved differently, however, with the older ones being more vocal in the comments and active in sharing the posts.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Although Facebook is a useful platform for launching A/B tests quickly to a broad audience, the tool has its drawbacks notably the lack of access to respondent-level microdata due to, among others, data privacy and commercial concerns. This prevents not only disaggregated analyses but also tracking of change in behavior over time (not just a one-off campaign). Facebook could be a "bridge" to bring potential experiment participants into a more robust setting (e.g., to sign them up into a program, move them to a different platform, etc.) to test for "sticky" behavior change. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Two months. Although the A/B test run only for one week, preparatory work (not including social listening and survey) and post-analysis took some time to undertake. 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

About 9,500

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

There should be, as it is the beginning salvo of our foray into social and behavioral communication for circular economy and zero waste, a key feature of our circular economic portfolio. This experiment is a very limited one—in social media testing for short-term outcomes—while we intend to take learnings into the field for longer-term experiments on sticky behavior change. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, see above, although the institutional home for the effort still needs to be discussed.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Ultimately, we knew that social and behavioral communication will be a crucial element in the portfolio but we also learned that it is not a solution in and of itself but a stage to bring in stakeholders into a "movement" for sustainable living. Moreover, although the numbers showed that the "collective action" ad garnered more enegagement and appealed more to the youth, there is nevertheless value in emphasizing "social responsibility" messages especially if deeper action is required. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

One of the main issues was whether or not we should use UNDP Philippines' account and branding (if not, which channel?) and, given the policy constraints, we just decided to use a project advocacy page that UNDP had used previously. Another early problem--not an operational obstacle but a conceptual one (for we could run the experiment anyway without resolving the issue)--was the lack of programme buy in and/or a partner who would sustain the effort moving forward. Partly ther risk of lack of sustainability due to lack of buy-in came a little true as the effort has not had follow through for quite some time. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Apart from the Climate programme who will steer the CO's efforts to build and implement the circular economy programme / portfolio, other programmes who are facing some behavioral and/or communication aspect in their work may benefit from the lessons. Definitely, the communications team may include the lessons--substantively and on the techniques--gained from this experiment. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government and civic organizations--and even private companies--who are campaigning or promoting for the shift to sustainable lifestyle may also learn from many of the rich and even humbling lessons from the experiment. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, a lot in terms of a) tweaking the design of the messages to be published; b) tweaking the caption and actual call to action (i.e. do we ask people to post pictures of their practices? Sign up for a newsletter or mailing list? etc.); c) engaging programme early on or experimenting quietly, etc.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

There's a lot, but one practical advice: make sure that the CO will be able to reimburse your ad placements! Or in the first place, that these are covered adequately in a firm's contract. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, see also my comment to the question "who at UNDP might benefit." Most immediately, SDGs on clean energy may benefit (on nudging consumption behavior). 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Significantly. As mentioned, the A/B test was just the latter part of a multi-component activity which began with sensing the current state of discussion on marine litter and plastic waste management and exploring what the current practitioners of a zero-waste lifestyle have gone through to shift from their old ways. 

> What surprised you?

Although we knew that different messaging treatments appeal to different segments of the population, we were delightfully surprised about how more deeply engaged the older generations may be compared to younger ones, although the latter were still engaged.
