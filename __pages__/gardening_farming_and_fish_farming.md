The land is six hector's. Thus, five hector's will be used for gardening, and one hector will be used for fish farming. For gardening it uses seeds of that particular season of the year and for fish the prototype is Tilapia fish. 

Under the mplementation plan, a timeframe will be  set and target dates for the completion of tasks, actions, communication and training of participants once there is enough funds to spearhead the project.
