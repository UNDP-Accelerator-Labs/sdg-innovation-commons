> Title of the innovation

Cage fish farm on Lukanga swamps

> Brief description of the innovation

In a nutshell it is simply cage culture on the swamp

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project will employ security personnel and feeders,  empower fish traders and transporters alike plus giving locals a continuous supply of fresh fish.

> Technical Feasibility

The design is that of a fish cage but since the swamps are shallow that a lake their will be bar to hold each facility to the ground/bottom.  Also since the water in the swamp doesn't mix by the process of downweilling and upweilling solar powered agitators should be fixed in cage.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Once the work is started on the swamp local communities will benefit directly through employment and a cheaper alternative source of protein with is fish.
