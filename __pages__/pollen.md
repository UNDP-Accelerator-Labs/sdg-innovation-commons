> Brief description of the innovation

Pollen is leveraging on the use of AI powered diagnosis tools to curb the spread of prevalence livestock and crop diseases of economic importance which cause huge economic losses to farmers and the state. Our approach is simple accurate and saves time and costs, allowing farmers to perform diagnosis and receive results and feedback instantly.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our solution is Pollen an App and USSD based digital platform using a combination of AI, Big data and Big Data Analytics into predictive models that function in real time by facilitating accurate, rapid detection and diagnosis of crop and livestock diseases. The system utilizes data captured from various locations to provide farm specific and ready to use data to farmers in their local languages for better livestock and crop management. Our business uses a subscription based revenue model; revenues are generated through subscription for services offered; instant diagnosis pay as you go for only $1, weekly best practice and vaccine remainders $0.6, Vet consultations $1 while Vets/ Pharmaceutical company subscriptions are 5% of each task performed. Our customers are farmers, cooperatives and government agencies such as E-slip.

> Technical Feasibility

Pollen is leveraging on the use of an app and ussd platform to provide farm specific and ready to use data to farmers in their local languages for better livestock and crop management and the government for better E-slip program implementation. Our farm management services at a go helps farmers to increase production while reducing costs. Most farmers are not conversant in the use of smart phones and are unbanked, thus we combined the Pollen app with a USSD based on boarding and diagnosis system for farmers in local Zambian languages; we have partnered with telecom service providers Airtel, MTN and Zamtel to facilitate the SMS diagnosis and airtime subscription system and we have integrated their mobile APIs with the entire Pollen ecosystem.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our enterprise creates tangible social economic benefits to 500 plus farmers on the platform and aims to create benefits to over 10,000 farmers by year end 2021 by digitizing and incorporating their operations with AI powered diagnosis tools to curb the spread of prevalence livestock and crop diseases of economic importance which cause huge economic losses to farmers. Farmers benefit through access to agro-services at a go, and are able to fund themselves via PollenFin savings cycles and revenue sharing model. This increases their output and income flows into communities to over $1200 per person per three months cycle.
