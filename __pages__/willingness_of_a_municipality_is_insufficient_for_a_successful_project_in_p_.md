## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Willingness of a municipality is insufficient for a successful project in participatory urban design. Their internal capacity should be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding with a partnership.  Residents are keen to be included in design processes for public spaces and some of them even have valuable skills. Municipalities should create a platform for participatory design and decision-making. Without a formal platform, it is difficult to engage the public in any meaningful way.  Though only a few, there are organizations and communities that work on participatory methods. They can be mobilized in urban design projects and their efforts can be complemented by local talent and resources like ours.  Working with a Japanese partner introduced some communication challenges due to language issues. Their lack of local knowledge as well as difficulty with working in English meant that we had to do quite a bit of comms work which was not anticipated at the beginning of the process.  Participatory urban design has traditionally been done through in-person workshops. Due to the pandemic-induced constraints, we had to facilitate the whole process using digital tools. We turned a major challenge into an opportunity to set an example and the result will be presented at Marmara Urban Forum (MARUF), an international conference in October.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Communication, in terms of language barriers between local partners and our Japanese partner has created an information gap since the designers could not directly interact with the stakeholders except UNDP and Kentsel Strateji. To overcome this challenge, AccLab had to intervene and act as a knowledge transfer point between the Municipality and our Japanese partner. As a result, building trust and common understanding between partners was challenging and there was a risk of coming up with a design which did not meet the local needs.  Since participatory design is not common in Turkey, especially in relatively small and disadvantaged regions, Municipalities tend to stick to their usual ways of working rather than embrace the diversity involved in participatory design processes. As such, our core partner (the Municipality) struggles at times to keep up with the pace and the requirements in this experiment. Their lack of capacity in terms of design, community building, coordination, PR, etc. proved to be a real challenge.  In terms of methods, due to the geographic distance of the partners and the pandemic restrictions, we had to rely on digital tools solely. We anticipated some digital activity but certainly did not expect to do the whole thing online. Generally, projects carried out in this field require face-to-face communication, the participants' learning about digital tools used in the workshops and the organization of these workshops by the Municipality created serious difficulties at first. This has also shown that participatory workshops can be conducted remotely but a lot more coordination and preparation is involved.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There was no previous experience of participatory design in Gokceada, so participatory observation was necessary. We held focus group discussions to understand the expectations of the Municipality and later on conducted participatory workshops with the residents during which we collected qualitative data through surveys. In partnership with Kentsel Strateji, we reviewed the literature as well. Geospatial data was used to provide information to the design team about the site. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The above methods were necessary since the experiment revolved around participatory design.   
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Marmara Municipalities Union (MMU) was one of our partners with whom we launched an open call to select a municipality. Here, the role of MMU was sharing its network ties and presence in the region and handling coordination with the municipality.  During the design phase, we worked with Kentsel Strateji a consultancy firm founded by an academic) who facilitated most of the workshops with residents. Their role was to translate the data collected during workshops into a design brief that could be used by the Japanese partner Sotonoba.  Our latest partner is Herkes Icin Mimarlik (Architecture for All, an NGO set up by architects who specialize in participatory design) who will be coordinating the building work in September & October. Their involvement was deemed necessary due to the lack of capacity at the municipality.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Gokceada Municipality is our core partner. They are responsible for providing the site (to be developed), handling necessary planning approvals and coordination of the residents’ participation in the process.  

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All partners in this project are new to UNDP Turkey. The CO has worked with municipalities before but never with Gokceada Municipality. MMU, Kentsel Strateji (Urban Strategy), Herkes için Mimarlık (Architecture for All) are new partners, they were instrumental in the design and building processes, respectively. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We designed this project as a multi-partner learning experience in which each partner played a role in meeting specific needs. Sotonoba (the Japanese partner), Kentsel Strateji, and Herkes Icin Mimarlik (Architecture for All) are all unusual partners for UNDP and without their involvement it would have been very difficult to progress this much in a short period.  We also had two not so unusual but new partners for UNDP. MMU with its extensive network enabled us to follow a strategy through which we invited interested parties to a new project rather than try to find one by approaching many directly. This saved us time and ensured that we had a willing and keen partner rather than a municipality that was merely interested but not invested enough. Gokceada Municipality, despite various disadvantages, had a site that met all our needs and a team of people who were enthusiastic.  Gokceada is a place of intense ethnographic diversity and contrast. During the co-creation process, ethnographic data was used to design the workshops. Listening to the needs of local people from them directly enabled us to form a common language between the parties. Although the Municipality had difficulties in promoting the project (and making it visible to the locals), the facilitators of the project (Urban Strategy and Architecture for All) made the process much more manageable for the Municipality by using HCD and helping with developing a proof-of-concept which was then introduced to the locals.
