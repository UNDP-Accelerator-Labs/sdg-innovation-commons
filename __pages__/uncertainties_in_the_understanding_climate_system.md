> Title of the innovation

Uncertainties in the understanding climate system

> Brief description of the innovation

The change in our climate is so affecting by the varies factors such as variation in the sun's output volcanic pollution the greenhouse gases the El Nino and LA Nina and human activities as the main factor which contribute to the climate change: emissions of carbon dioxide, deforestation, combustion of large amount of fuel in our homes and industries and the use of artificial fertilizer leading to an increase in poverty levels

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The change in the climate can change alot in our lives we we hv good climate system will have a lot of fish in rivers and lakes meaning there will be good marketing, it will improve the agriculture system,it will a a good vegetation and tourism will be improved also lastly but not the list we have a good and healthy atmospheric condition

> Technical Feasibility

By practicing reforestation and aforestation making machines that produces less harmful gases to the atmosphere reduce the greenhouse gases, reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, stopping deforestation, adapt the recycling system than burning to reduce combustion of fuel and All that which may be a threat to our climate

> Anticipated Social Impact

If we control and maintain the a activities will be receiving good rainfall which will make a lot of people to engage themselves in farming there will be good grope production many people will be sustained even those at low class there will be marketing since fishing will be also good and the country at large will have Goods enough to sustain the nation and to export too the other countries will in return we get what we don't have or earn income apart from this there will be good health good agriculture  system good vegetation rivers oceans lakes animals which will attract more tourists to come in  while provided good and favoureble whether condition for the tourists n marketeers and everyone
