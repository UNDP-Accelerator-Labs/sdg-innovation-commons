This elegant necklace is hand-made by Rako Pasefika out of Fijian coconut shell sourced from the island of Rotuma. Using naturally abundant Coconuts, each mini-button is individually shaped out of coconut shell to just the right size, before being drilled to create the perfect incision. The coconut buttons are strung together using cotton fiber chord which is hand-woven.
