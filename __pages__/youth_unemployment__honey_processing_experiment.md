## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Zandile Mthembu

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

9 August 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Inclusive and economic growth 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Our challenge is that employment opportunities among women and youth are very limited yet there are a lot of women and youth who are engaged in the manufacturing of various products that have no market access. Consequently, 72% of women are self-employed in the informal sector and 25% of youth are also running micro enterprises in the informal sector. Hence our assumption is that if local MSME’s are supported with domestic market access and product promotion and development, then local MSME’s can grow to provide employment opportunities for vulnerable groups such as women and the youth.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

The intended learning question(s) are 1. that of understanding impediments that inhibit local products from penetrating local market linkages and the support required for that locally produced product to get tractions in domestic and regional markets. 2.  Understand the success factors of processing and marketing locally processed honey product. This experiment is related to the Buy swazi portfolio, which has 3 experiments. This is the third component, which looks at supporting the development of high impact value chains i.e Honey. The honey value chain is predominantly characterized by beekeepers who sell their honey raw and unprocessed. This model leads to low income for farmers, and loss of potential income they can get from byproducts such as wax. The team identified a youth group in the area of Magele, a rural community in Shiselweni region. The group was supported by MTN foundation and Eswatini water and agricultural development enterprise (ESWADE) - Smallholder Market-Led Project (SMLP) to start farming honey and selling it raw to the market. The intent was to:  a. process the honey and finding new markets to help improve the income for the youth group.   b.   Addressing formal markets access barriers by meeting requirements such as formal business registration, setting up a formal working facility following food safety and quality management protocols.   c.  Provision of processing equipment e.g. extractor, weighing equipment. d. Support with packaging, branding, and bar-coding to attract new formal markets.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The intended learning question(s) is that of understanding impediments that inhibit local products from penetrating local market linkages and the support required to that locally produced products can get tractions in domestic and regional markets. 2.  Understand the success factors of processing and marketing locally processed honey product.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If Honey  farmers are provided with supporting enablers for processing raw product  and given the necessary support for formal business operations, then they will be able process the raw honey, find new markets and address all other formal markets access barriers.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The AccLab carried out the following activities to test the hypothesis:  1. Partnered with two development organizations - The lab identified that ESWADE  (Eswatini water and agricultural development enterprise) Smallholder Market-Led Project (SMLP) which is a government company that supports various small agriculture projects in communities. They had an ongoing honey project whose honey farming project started from 2017 by grouping unemployed youths in the community of Magele. At the start, MTN Foundation (one of the leading mobile networks in the country) supported the group with funding to establish an apiary. The ESWADE project had 4 components and one of which entailed processing of the honey, laying foundation for the social aspect of the group and training the participants for business transformation so that the groups sustain their livelihoods in agriculture processing. The second partner organization identified was SEDCO (Small enterprises development company). SEDCO has business incubation facility across the country where small enterprises are able to get lower rented formal businesses offices and also get business development training on various administration matters. The group is based close to a local town called Hlathikhulu where SEDCO has underutilized facilities. The lab made an arrangement with SEDCO to reserve a room which will be used as a honey processing factory, by the youth group. A 1 year rent holiday was negotiated for them to set up and kickstart operations. ESWADE committed funds to refurbish the room and installed necessary factory fittings. Through the processed honey sales, the youth would take care of utility bills and other running costs of the processing facility. 2. The AccLab sourced the honey processing unit which was commissioned by the supplier. The Youth group's role was to established to continue working with ESWADE in sourcing honey from farmers if their apiary(with 32 hives) didn't produce enough for processing. CATALYZE  a business development organization contracted by ESWADE supported the group with sourcing inputs for the business i.e. packaging, logo design, setting up business administration reports, crafting a marketing plan and group governance policies. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis for the intervention is to observe the processing unit business model, gather qualitative data about the compliance to quality management systems.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data collection technique entails monthly meetings that the technical working group partner reps meet to give an update together with the youth group chairperson and executive members. A reporting template was developed for monitoring the progress particularly on the business development part. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

If Honey farmers are provided with equipment and facilitated to move up the honey value chain then they will be able to access new markets and improve their livelihoods in the honey value chain. This hypothesis was proven in the duration of the experiment starting from January 2022 to 2023.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Yes we do have observations reports for the the chosen experiment method. We would not change anything in the methodology so far.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

From design to results its took 12 months (January 2022 to 2023).

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

$7371,00

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes the next stage once the experiment learnings are captured, an evaluation of the experiment is set for end of August 2022. The key success indicators which are the sales, participation of group members in accordance to the Cooperatives guidelines. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

There are currently 2 other development partners (SEDCO, ESWADE) supporting the youth group in its activities, there is hope that the scaling part is possible through demonstration of high performance working culture and learnings that indicate sustainability prospects for the intervention.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

NA

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The main learnings during this action learning plan revealed other key learnings that i would like to share: 

1. The youth-led entrepreneurial experiment in honey processing in Magele, a rural community was, revealed that entrepreneurship demands significant support, particularly in the first year, and not all participants displayed the necessary tenacity. Many dropped out during the early challenging stages due to chasing paying occupations. The youths, mostly from low-income families, lacked basic school education, business knowledge and depended heavily on ESWADE for guidance. Despite easy access to capacity building, equipment for processing, other factors affecting the youths’ motivation and independence need further investigation. However, presenting their project at agricultural events has motivated them, leading to mentoring opportunities with other farmers in the honey sector, and potential clients. Market barriers for processed honey were lower than anticipated, as no food safety requirements were required by retailers and clients. 

2. We also learnt about the importance of incorporating a stipend or labor cost into community-based projects to motivate participants, especially those from poverty-stricken backgrounds who lack support structures for their basic needs. 

3. Its also key to assess the entrepreneurial capacity of the beneficiaries for business projects. Even though the honey processing business model improved the youths’ farming project, not all were naturally entrepreneurial or well-versed in business administration. Standard business training and roping in unassessed beneficiaries leads to poor success and sustainability. 

4. As the experiment drew to a close, it became apparent that local stores were offering a range of imported processed honey, posing a challenge to local honey producers who were attempting to enhance their product’s value but found themselves unable to match the competition in aspects like pricing, packaging, and presentation. Additionally, it was observed that numerous honey producers in Hlatikhulu faced difficulties in providing unprocessed honey to local processors. This situation highlighted the critical need for ongoing market research, product innovation, and the implementation of national policies to bolster and safeguard the domestic honey sector.

5. The activities involved in the honey processing business were intricate and proved to be too demanding for the group’s capabilities. Looking back, a gradual, step-by-step method might have been more effective in guiding the group through the various stages of the honey value chain. The group faced the challenge of tackling two advanced stages of value addition at once: processing and product distribution. The takeaway is that it would have been more beneficial for the group to initially focus on mastering the agricultural processing aspects, then build assurance in managing quality and food safety before moving on to the task of offering their products to upscale retail outlets.

6. The practice of assembling large groups for community members to participate such development projects aimed at income generation can be impractical and often results in conflicting: dynamics, priorities, and expectations within the group, potentially undermining the project’s success. UNDP should reconsider this approach, which is commonly used by many development agencies as it frequently yields unsatisfactory outcomes. Additionally, the high number of participants can lead to subpar performance due to unfulfilled expectations, as the production levels of many start-ups do not typically generate the anticipated profits and dividends, leading to disappointment and underperformance among members.

7. It’s essential to follow community procedures to gain their support and ownership, but the selection for community projects should be based on objective criteria, not just active participation. Proper evaluation of the project’s demands is necessary to ensure individuals are chosen and grouped by their interests and skills. For this experimental group, implementing psychometric evaluations prior to assigning specific roles could have been beneficial. Moreover, it’s important to establish defined governance rules and mechanisms for resolving conflicts within the group to facilitate fair and swift handling of any problems.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacles and challenges were that; 1. the youth group members academic capabilities were low, which affected their business management and administration. 2. The dropout rate was quite high as a few members of the group 4/20 were able to remain in the project as the months progressed 3. The market dynamics changed during the experiment period, presenting highly competitive prices for processed honey. The startup intervention of the youth suffered as they were unable to match that competition. 4. The honey flow season was another big challenge as they youth was only able to harvest honey combs once a year from their apiary. This then meant that they had to source honeycombs from other farmers throughout the year to keep the business flowing. The supply of honey was a business operation limiting factor as there was also competition in the buyers' prices for the combs.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Inclusive growth portfolio of CPD priorities in the CO state that UNDP will support strategies to increase the innovation and entrepreneurship skills, productivity and income potential of young men and women by testing cost-effective and scalable market-based solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals, especially in the areas of renewable energy and environment sustainability. This will include: building capacities and developing skills for youth groups and individuals by providing sustainable extension services, mentorship and entrepreneurial training for innovative solutions that promote renewable energy and are environmentally sustainable. This experimental activity speaks directly to this priority. The learnings gathered from this experiment will help inform implementation of similar interventions involving the youth especially.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

1. The Government ministries, such as Ministry of Commerce trade and industry, Ministry of Youth sports and culture (which has programmes such the Youth fund) and Ministry of Agriculture. 2. Development partners 3. Other small businesses in agro-processing businesses especially honey value chain 4. Youth programmes run by NGOs that support youth led businesses. They would get insights on challenges that are faced by youth in business coming from indigent backgrounds.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. The high drop out rate of members was a course for concern for us as this was a red flag for sustainability of the project. The team dynamics were also an ongoing problem that led to sluggish progress, calling for continuous handholding and intervening from the development organisations involved. 

The project team concluded that the honey processing facility that was provided by SEDCO is leased to a fully operational private honey company that will hire the youth to build their capacity. However this recommendation did not kickoff as other challenges were identified. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

My advise for someone wanting to replicate this experiment activity would be to hire a business development consultant to support with the capturing of learnings and also play the role of business developer to the group. This will help in quickly addressing issues that require urgent support and capturing of learnings. 

Ensure that the beneficiaries are well capacitated to enter the next level of the value chain and have tangible indicators of being entrepreneurial e.g ( know how to manage the operations, are able to sell and market at least).

Equipment for processing can be tricky to source. Hence find a honey processing expert to provide advise on the latest and most effective machinery for industrial capacity.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. It can also be replicated in SDG 17 theme for partnerships in solving development challenges. Such an intervention requires collaborative efforts as there's a lot of success factors that come into play for a startup business to succeed.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The explore phase shaped the experiment by identifying the sector, finding and engaging partners also negotiating. The sense phase supported mostly on the community based engagements, finalizing partnership agreements with the partners. In hindsight we could have requested more background analysis of the group's business productivity details over the years since they were brought together and also understand the learnings the private sector organization (MTN Foundation) that supported them at the start of the project.

> What surprised you?

The low health and food safety risk of honey as a processed product.
