Home-made mobile cafe: green idea to earn money.

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

This a hand-made mobile cafe is an example how local migrants living about Bishkek
(the capital of the Kyrgyz republic) earn money. Ainura sells hot tea, buns and
sandwiches on the local open market. She uses the homemade carriage to transport
her products and the foam plastic box which was made by her husband to keep the
food hot during her working day.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Ainura came to Bishkek from a remote village, she is internal (local) migrant. She has a big family and she didn’t have work in her village. Because of her small business she earns about 10-15$ daily, 300-450$ per month. She is the breadwinner in her family and can feed and educate her children and support her parents.









> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Her business is a "green" business because she doesn’t use petrol for her mobile café and electricity to re-heat food. This is also the example how materials can be recycled: the carriage and the foam plastic box are made from the secondary materials.
