Thatch roofing is renewable, available, and quite durable.  It provides excellent insulation and keeps the room in the hot times. In addition, the superb insulation enables the restaurant to save on electricity for heating and cooking. They are much more environmentally friendly than shingles, which are made of metal and can be recycled and reused as shingles on the roofs.
