## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1- “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” initiative (COMPANIES OF EXCELLENCY) recognizes companies with high performance and best management and sustainability practices in the national business landscape, based on a set of criteria that are defined annually. On the “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” platform, managers have the possibility to undertake a self-diagnosis test of target business indicators for their firms, in order to evaluate business health and implement better policies to improve management and, consequently, its economic and financial performance. The evaluation performed in this process helps managers identify areas for improvement and implement positive changes in their processes, products and services. The search for excellence and the desire to stand out in reference to the evaluation criteria can drive innovation and continuous improvement in the company. By being recognized as an “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA”, the company increases its notoriety and prestige. This can attract the attention of investors, customers and potential business partners, strengthening the company's image in the market. Obtaining the “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” distinction gives the company advantages with the banking system, facilitating the access to credit. These advantages can improve company's growth, strengthen its market position, and expand business opportunities. Recognition as an “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” can help attract qualified talents. Professional job seekers tend to consider the company's reputation and success when deciding where to work.

2- “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” initiative can induce the implementation of the SDGs and ESG (Environment Social and Governance) principles in companies’ operations, which can provide benefits such as attracting investors, gain competitive advantage over competitors and attracting more customers. Customers are increasingly demanding and concerned about sustainable development and the reduction of risks. Adopting ESG practices can help companies identify and mitigate risks related to environmental and social issues, avoiding potential negative impacts on their operations and reputation. Additionally, implementing energy efficiency and waste reduction measures can lead to long-term cost savings. Recognition as an “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” can open doors to strategic partnerships with other companies and organizations that seek excellence in their operations. These partnerships can lead to business collaborations, knowledge sharing and access to new market opportunities.

3- The distinction of companies is a model used successfully in several countries to recognize good practices in corporate management and in performance of managers and entrepreneurs, contributing to the creation of a business culture of excellence.

These initiatives are implemented around the world to strengthen the private sector, many of them organized by the private sector itself other their representative associations, and also by public institutions or the civil society organizations. Many examples and models are available, including the “1000 Melhores PMEs” initiative, organized by EXAME magazine in partnership with E&amp;Y and Informa D&amp;B, which identifies the 1000 best SMEs in Portugal. Also “Heróis PME” Award, an initiative by Yunit Consulting, which recognizes the work of businesspeople and teams who contribute every day to help develop the economy and generate jobs in Portugal. Other examples include Fortune 500, Forbes 500, World's Most Ethical Companies Ethisphere, Best Corporate Citizens, Financial Times 1000 and “Prémio Valor Inovação Brasil”.

4- Banks in Cape Verde have systematically highlighted that the disclosure of financial information timely and in regular basis is one of the major weaknesses of national companies. This has been one of the main limiting factors for companies to access to financing. In Cape Verde, access to credit is appointed as one of the main constraints to business initiative, to the development of private sector and to the growth of national economy, in several reports. “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” can help overcome this problem. When companies keep their financial records up to date they are demonstrating financial responsibility, which generates trust in banks, and this can be translated into advantages for companies, such as better credit conditions, lower interest rates, access to more sophisticated financial products and potential investment opportunities. Furthermore, companies distinguished by the “EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA”  initiative will tend to present solid performance and efficient management, which will enhance credibility near the system with greater capacity to meet financial commitments and generate consistent returns. Banks may consider these companies as preferred customers and be willing to offer special services and conditions to retain them. These kinds of initiatives are supported by banks around the world, for example, “Novo Banco” in Portugal, in partnership with IAPMEI institute, supports SMEs that want to register for the PME Líder certification, assisting them in the application process. Another concrete example is the “Expresso PME | Caixa TOP”, a joint initiative between the “Caixa Geral de Depósitos” Group and the Expresso newspaper, in collaboration with Informa D&amp;B and Deloitte. This award recognizes and rewards SMEs that have with superior performance in the main sectors of the Portuguese economy, demonstrating sustained growth in their businesses.

5-“EMPRESA EXCELÊNCIA” grants public recognition not only to the companies directly involved, but also to the Associations representing Private Sector. This can increase the Association's prestige and visibility in the market, strengthening its reputation as an organization that promotes and values business excellence and is always close to its members. Furthermore, it opens doors to networking opportunities and strategic partnerships. This initiative can strengthen the position of the Business Association as an influential agent in boosting the private sector and promoting business growth. Associations will have the opportunity to obtain global information from their members, which can help to have a more accurate understanding of the economic and financial conditions of each sector. The information can be used to guide the Association's strategic planning, identify trends and develop actions and initiatives beneficial to member companies. Furthermore, they can offer advice on financial management, access to financing, cost reduction strategies and resource optimization, among other aspects related to business finance, demonstrating the association's proximity to businesspeople. By analyzing information from member companies, Associations can identify emerging needs and trends in the industry. This information can guide the development of programs, services and initiatives that meet specific requirements of member companies and keep them updated and competitive.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Throughout the process, companies and partners were interviewed, surveys were developed, and the platform collects company registration information and financial data about the companies in forms. In Cape Verde there is no obligation to disclose companies' financial data and there are still few companies that do so voluntarily. This is the project's biggest challenge, getting companies to adopt a culture of transparency and information sharing for good management and accountability. The project promotes this culture by providing companies with a free tool for assessing their economic and financial situation and distinguishing companies that consistently adopt these practices and obtain superior performance in economic, financial and sustainability terms, giving them notoriety and distinction.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

“EMPRESAS EXCELÊNCIA” is a systemic intervention in the business ecosystem to promote the quality of companies' financial information and promote good management practices, transparency and sustainability in companies according to ESG principles. This intervention involves partnerships at various levels, from private sector associations, banking sector, government entities and communication partners, and the development of a digital platform to attract companies and benefit them with services and relevant information to raise awareness of the issues and objectives in reference. The platform is a database of financial information, voluntarily fed by companies with information that allows them to be evaluated and distinguish those with the best performance at national level.
