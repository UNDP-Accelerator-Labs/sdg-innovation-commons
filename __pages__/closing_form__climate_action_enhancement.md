## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

In the "Tu Mirada Importa" initiative, we learned that despite most adolescents having a pessimistic perspective regarding the evolution of climate change in Uruguay, a 31% of the adolescent considered that the situation would be better, compared to 14% of the adults surveyed, which represents a window of opportunity to support them as agents of change. Both adults and adolescents linked climate change with environmental issues in general. This was visualized through a greater association of responsible waste management practices, reuse, and recycling. This showed us that there is still much to be known and learned by the public about the phenomenon of climate change and its environmental, social, and economic implications. Also, the adolescents raised proposals for awareness campaigns demonstrating that it is necessary to continue deepening the understanding of climate change, confirming their concern, capacity, and enthusiasm to propose ideas and implement actions to mitigate or adapt to climate change. It is needed more spaces and activities that empower them in the climate agenda, not only participating but also building it. Regarding "Research for the Climate", we learned that there is interest and capacity in the country to contribute to the generation of knowledge, receiving 10 projects linked to more than 70 people in just fifteen days. On the other hand, the dialogue between academia and public policy is far from fluid and requires a permanent approach over time to move towards a cultural change in relation to how diverse coalitions that can include researchers and policymakers can generate effective results. It is also about building confidence.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

On the one hand, we found as a barrier the difficulty of achieving the participation of researchers and decision-makers of public policy in the same event. Beyond the fact that some factors such as the date and the location could have affected, there could be preconceptions on one side or the other, which could have affected the attendance level. One limitation to achieving a greater impact is that we were only able to finance the implementation of two projects, out of the ten presented. According to the evaluation panel, there were also other relevant projects that were not selected due to limited funds. In the case of adolescents, a bottleneck is what happens after our intervention, because public policy actions are required. In other words, we know that if they are called to get involved with climate change, we achieve high participation of young people. The challenge is then to ensure that their voices are considered for the implementation of actions.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Through focus groups:  • with young climate activist • adolescents • scientist and public servant we sought to know their opinion about climate change, identify barriers and what possible actions could be more successful when it comes to expanding the scope to greater awareness, dialogue, and citizen participation in climate action. Through surveys and collective intelligence workshops and events we have supplemented the climate promise report, which was only intended for adults. In this way, it was possible to bring the voice of young people and their opinions to this process. "Research for the Climate" was the first call for research projects on the subject in Uruguay. This allowed us and our counterparts to understand the current research groups, their location, topics addressed, and relationships between researchers, which allowed us a greater knowledge of our academic ecosystem. Besides, through the collective intelligence event, it was possible to identify barriers that otherwise would not have been possible, promoting cooperative exchange, reflection, and criticism between public servants and researchers.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The co-creation process was necessary to engage adolescents in the Climate Promise. We worked together with a group of young environmental activists for that purpose. In addition, we co-designed the actions and events for a more appropriate approach so we could expand the participation of young people and foster a collective intelligence approach. We designed a pilot instrument with the National Agency for Research and Innovation and the Ministry of Environment, which helped make visible and recognize climate actions unknown by the public policy.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

No más colillas; No más plásticos; Ecoladrillos; Friday for Futures Young activists who are part of these organizations participated in a co-design activity that led to the "Tu Mirada Importa” initiative. They received training from the Acclab team to be facilitators of collective intelligence events and they facilitated the workshop aimed at more than 150 adolescents.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Universidad de Montevideo; Universidad de la República. These Universities will be carrying out the 2 selected projects of the call "Research for the Climate". Both centers participated with researchers in the collective intelligence workshop.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Brava; Brava is a private organization that works on innovation skills and gender equity. They were part of the training of the facilitators (young activists).

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Environment; National Agency for Research and Innovation. The Climate Promise is coordinated by a UNDP consultant who works in the Ministry of Environment, articulating with the different areas of the Ministry. In this way, the Ministry was part of all the activities. The National Agency for Research and Innovation, ANII, developed the call for research projects and carried out the operational stage of project execution through an agreement with the UNDP.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

It was the first time that an initiative was developed with the National Research and Innovation Agency, which marks a milestone in the contribution that UNDP can make to developing the ecosystem in this area. In addition, we worked with young activists from civil society organizations, promoting their active participation throughout the entire process. This was very well received by the young people who were somewhat surprised that a United Nations program would work directly with them.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Together with UNICEF, we developed “Tu Mirada Importa”. Their participation was relevant to achieve a greater reach.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

A common aspect of both initiatives was the importance and need to broaden voices and participation in complex issues such as climate change, which requires the involvement of all people. In this sense, as our regional director, Luis Felipe López-Calva, highlighted during his visit to Uruguay, it is essential to bet on the development of active coalitions, where there are safe spaces to talk freely, based on a common interest to invite actors who have elements to influence decisions. It is necessary to understand and bring new actors to the table without prejudice, and in this regard, the role of UNDP will continue to be key, as an integrator towards collective climate action. To consolidate spaces for dialogue, and integrate a greater diversity of groups, is key to developing a collective intelligence approach to tackle the sustainable development challenges. If we had not promoted these safe areas of expression, perhaps many of the criticisms and reflections would not have been raised, since we must bear in mind the prejudices and preconceptions that may exist about those groups or voices that have not been considered in the conversation or vice versa, how they see the public servants. In this regard, we have learned that the UNDP can play a key role as a convener, articulator and generator of safe environments for collective intelligence and co-creation.
