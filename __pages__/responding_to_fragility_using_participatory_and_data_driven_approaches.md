## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Responding to Fragility using participatory, data- approaches and platforms.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is no corporate framework to respond to fragility. How to be prepared for fragility? how do you navigate it? innovative ways to try and respond? Highly volatile environment which necessitates perpetual pivoting in a responsive fashion. organizational settings, data empowerment, design, and planning internally for robust readiness responsiveness to navigate fragile settings in a highly volatile and declining environment for adaptive and agile programming.  This also includes reimagining UNDP's work culture & processes to experiment in defining a new normal & adapting to it.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Lebanon falling into a highly volatile and fragile setting since 2019, and as the context declines and moves towards uncertainty. There is no existing framework that speaks to the particular context and prepares us for a responsive agenda towards the impending future.  The history lies in the context but also our 2020 experiments that have led us to this learning challenge which resulted in the current CO strategy note (Manage, mitigate, transform). Economic free fall, vulnerability expanding far & wide with the likely undesired effects of widespread tensions and conflicts.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

in 2020 Lebanon looked like: CPI increase 150% food and non alcoholic beverage increase by 400% inflation at 400% Fuel shortages Removal of subsidies drop in private sector sales by 45% in 2020 full time employment declined by an average of 23% in 2020

Lebanon has now been listed as a hunger hot-spot. The country is lagging on vaccination efforts and is reeling under COVID healthcare stress as well as declining economic conditions that have stripped the healthcare system of its talent and needed material and medication. The collapse of healthcare can be eminent, and as it is coming at the tail of the collapse of the banking system, food, and job security. Fragility is the current reality and there is no outlook on the extent of damage, which is why internal responsiveness and readiness is our target.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The timely moment where UNDP Lebanon CPD will be developed this year and future-proofing would mean that the active and preemptive role of the lab is optimal in this setting. As lab positioned outside any standing portfolio we are the most well-positioned to float with and outside the organization to sens-make and gather collective intelligence that would otherwise remain locked in different pockets of the organization, which allows for a holistic view to encounter or prepare for fragile settings. The situation is uncertain and the only way to go about it is by informing it through quick experiments and participatory collective intelligence processes. This is essential if we are to ensure UNDP CO business continuity in light of the impending future. This falls in Lab duty as it is a learning on development for Lebanon and the global network, as countries face more fragile settings.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

@undpacclabs are using their experimental toolkit to navigate uncertainty & connect different dots across teams, programmes, and partners. Using a participatory, data-informed, interactive process for readiness, agility, and adaptability.  #FragileStates #SoliddevlopmentGoals

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can a country office in fragile settings develop adaptive and agile responses to inform a strategic and sustainable outlook?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The methods will be used in the design & implementation of the framework & related platforms & tools to be created. They will allow us to engage colleagues & partners to build a strategic direction based on their inputs & knowledge & roll out experiments with the buy-in and support.  - We will use collective intelligence to identify UNDP's comparative advantage through a series of thematic workshops using our pre-established "Join the Conversation" platform to inform the UNCF.  - We will prototype, in collaboration with CO colleagues & Crisis Bureau, a citizen-centric conflict risk dashboard to provide conflict/fragility-related insights, to be collectively analyzed and inform programming  - We will use sensemaking activities to identify workflows & data flows that can become engagement spaces to inform the thematic & comparative advantage workshops during the CPD development process 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data sources aim to fill the gap of inexistence/outdatedness of traditional data sources that can be used to inform the experiments
