## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The methods were used because the team wanted to collect accurate information on our challenge and can be mostly done through observing peoples behaviors over time.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

There was need for innovators to develop prototypes for multiple experimentation and this could only be better achieved through the use of the above tool.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

With the use of innovative data and collaboration with partners in carrying out the frontier challenge, the team was able to learn and better understand how to respond to challenges of young women and men entrepreneurs in order to cerate an ever improving experience. In responding to these challenges, it was understood that one of the ways is by creating innovative employment and expanding of livelihood opportunities for young innovators.
