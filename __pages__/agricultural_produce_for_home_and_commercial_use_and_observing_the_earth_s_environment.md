> Title of the innovation

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE FOR HOME AND COMMERCIAL USE AND OBSERVING THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT

> Brief description of the innovation

In our plan , the idea is to create opportunities for both small businesses and large firms to develop and in observation with climate change .In our research we observed that we can still develop even without deterioration of our natural resources which include land, minerals, vegetation, oil, water ,air and many more. For example, goat and cattle ranching may require small piece of land. And part from that , it does not require unnecessary cutting of  trees and the air pollution is very low. This can help small businesses and large firms to develop, hence contributing to the welfare of the nation and the world at large. Save land, minerals and grow trees to improve the climate.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As mentioned earlier, the  small firms will be able to supply their produce to butcheries for cash , and butcheries will supply to the community, or mini mart stores. This will give employment to butchery attendants, marketeers , sales attenendants at mini marts stores , of which the employees and employers will be pay tax and at the same time supplying food to the nation without destroying much of natural resources. Apart from that, since farmers won't need big land for farming, the other land can be utilised for growing of trees for timber, hence reducing the importation of timber, instead, export timber.

> Technical Feasibility

Given example of a small scale farmers, within ten acres of land , the farm can have a house, waterbohore,  can keep 400 -700 goats or 150-300 cattle, and even be able to do other farming activities e.g maize for food, tomatoes and also be able to have an acre or two for timber purposes.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As people will require small lands, there will be no shortage of land, no land rangles, people will also be able socialise as they will learn to depend on one another, for example goats farmers buying maize from maize farmers or vice-versa.
