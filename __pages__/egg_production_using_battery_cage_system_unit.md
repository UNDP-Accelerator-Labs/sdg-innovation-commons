> Title of the innovation

Egg Production Using Battery Cage System Unit

> Brief description of the innovation

To House 480 Birds at Point of Lay under Battery Cage System and produce 960 Trays per quarter, this translates 3840 trays per year. The Revenue is estimated at ZMW 52,800 per quarter that translates to ZMW 211,200 per year
The project will focus on producing Organic eggs due to the current demand of eggs for consumption to the general community that is rich in proteins and affordable to all.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Innovation will generate income in a number of ways that is through the sale of eggs, the sale of manure to back yard vegetable growers, Sale of ex layers after the production cycle, through site visits, In house Training for would be poultry farmers and through consultancy.
 The innovation will encourage retailers (Women &amp; Youths) to order stock from us hence being able to meet the family demands.
In battery Cage System, Commercial egg production is higher because the movement of the laying hens is limited. thus the hens are confined to absorb more food material that would turn into more frequent egg production. This is the opposite  of what is obtained  from floor rearing or open space rearing system.
In Battery cage system feed waste is reduced to a minimal as there will be no direct contact with the feed, Also for no direct contact with the egg carrier, egg loss due to breaking by hens is also reduced. 
Stock taking and counting is much easier in the batter cage system as compared to deep litter system.
Less spread of diseases and infections  under battery cage system as compared to deep litter System. The Innovation is addressing  the egg demand gap  and has a Commercial and social Value.
 The above  reasons will help improve the operations of the Business.
 Our targeted Market is as follows
- Retailers( Marketers) especially Women and Youths
-Small Scale Farmers in Rural Areas
-Restaurants, Guest Houses, Lodges and Hotels.
-The General Community where our Business is operating from.
The Challenge prize will help to grow the business due to the locality of the Business as retailers will not  travel long distances to out source the eggs. 
The funds will be used to expand the business, grow the customer base and diversify into sunflower and soya bean production that will help reduce the cost of feed and at the same time increase the Revenues.
The Value addition on the environment is that the manure collected from the Birds will help to improve the fertility of the soil to Vegetable farmers. The Same manure can also be used to produce maggots for the birds that can be mixed in the feed or dried and given to the Birds thus reducing the feed cost and also improving the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The Battery Cage system unit is designed to save the space and accommodate a good number of birds in a small space. A 2m x 2m can accommodate 120 birds that cannot happened if birds are to be put on the Floor. The Cage is designed to hold feed and water through nipples. Water only comes out of the nipples if the birds pecks the nipple thus using water only when needed. When the Bird lays an eggs, the eggs will roll down to the collection point.
The proposed implementation plan is as follows
- Purchase Battery Cage Units
- Purchase the Birds at Point of Lay
-Purchase the Stock Feed
-Purchase vitamins and Vaccines
 -Start the Egg production process

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Innovation will produce poultry products for sale and the proceeds will not only assist the business to meet basic necessities of life but the community at large due to the Cheap and availability of eggs.
The Innovation seeks to create employment opportunities to Poor Women and Youths so that they can carter for themselves and to some extent  to their dependents. 
The Poultry sub sector is also economically important in Zambia as it accounts for about 35% of the total agriculture products. It is in this regard that we keened with Interest in ensuring that economic improvement and see the Nation on the right path towards the achievement of the Fifth  National Development goals and objectives by embarking on the Poultry project in Livingstone. 
Egg Consumption has increased to replace more expensive forms of protein in households that have seen a decline in their income as a result of Covid-19 Job Losses and Forced leave.
Egg production  with the use of Battery Cage system Unit is an appropriate project  to increase communities' resilience in Food security during and after Covid-19 Pandemic. 
The proposed innovation is very relevant to the current market because it does not require a huge space of land to set up the Business thus encouraging more people to venture in the same line of innovation.
