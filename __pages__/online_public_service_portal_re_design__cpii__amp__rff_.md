## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Tran Huong Giang

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

05/04/2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

digital transformation in public sector

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

online public administrative services are ineffective and hardly accessible for citizen

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Improved accessibility to public administration services can increase number of users of services.

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)
- Fully Randomised (RCTs, etc.)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

the Center of Public Administration of Thua Thien-Hue Province and the Thua Thien-Hue Center for Information Technology (HueCIT)
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Provide hands-on experience for government officials to learn how to create and implement an experiment in the digital transformation of public services so that it’s more accessible to vulnerable groups. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis: If we make streamline the portal so that it’s less busy, more directional, and aligns with accessibility standards, then not only the general public but also vulnerable groups, especially blind and visually impaired people will use the portal more often Hypothesis 1: IF we improve the features of the search section (so that different keywords can produce search results), THEN people will need less time to do the procedure on the platform, more satisfied and the number of users will increase. Hypothesis 2: IF the login function is simpler, less requirements, THEN people will need less time and easier to carry out the procedure, will be more satisfied and the number of users will increase.
