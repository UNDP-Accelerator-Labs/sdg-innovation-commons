> Title of the innovation

Banana plantation

> Brief description of the innovation

I have been thinking of this innovation since I have seen how the climate is really changing due the poor agriculture practice that are being done by the local people. So this has great brought great harm intteams of our staple food that maize and the use of too much fertilizer has brought a harm both to soil and water. Moreover, bananas are good source of carbohydrates so they are great deal that can replace maize for local people and the nation at large, they are also good because they are drought restance meaning that they can be good crop to the Changing climate. In my view am seeing if this can be done it can also help to employ and reduce the dependency on tobacco that has great seeing a great number of trees being cut each and every year and increased number of children dropout of school because they are being use has cheap labor during  the tobacco processing period.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This how the innovation is likely going to generate income, through the selling of the same bananas, this will not bring money but also the local people that will be involved in selling of the product hence they be making earn living for both there families.
The other thing is that I will not work alone on the plantation but I need labor that can help in looking and caring for the same plantation so by so doing I will create employment both local and indirect like transporters.
In the same vein it will also reduce on children being used has labor. This because I educate them on the importance of educating children so from the same income they pay for school fees.

> Technical Feasibility

From October 2012 it has been plained for clearing the land in readiness for the planting this will take up to December 2021. Then the planting itself will take place from January 2022 to April 2022. This because I want to take advantage of the rains.

> Anticipated Social Impact

One, it will improve the lives through bring money and vitamin, since they have a fruit that is not only rich in carbohydrates but also in vitamin.
It also going to improve the standard of living and healthy.
The market is also going to have a lot of fruits and it going bring a balance on gender since most of the business at market are done by women hence reducing independance on their husbands.
