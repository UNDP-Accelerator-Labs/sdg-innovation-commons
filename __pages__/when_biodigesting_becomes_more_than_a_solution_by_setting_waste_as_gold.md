It should be noted that this solution consists of three units: The electronics which, according to the manufacturer, have a duration of 4 years; The Battery which lasts on average three years and finally, the metal here galvanized to withstand the negative and corrosive effects. For marketing, the difference is in the storage capacity since: the one with a capacity of 2000 liters is sold at 1800 USD, 1200 liters at 800 USD and finally that of 250 liters at 300 USD.
