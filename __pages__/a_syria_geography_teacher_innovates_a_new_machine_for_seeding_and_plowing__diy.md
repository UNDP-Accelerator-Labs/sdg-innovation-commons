## Geography professor "Hossam Naguib Al-Shoufi" invented an agricultural machine that could be easily used in flat and mountainous areas, which helps reduce the expenses of seed planting and land plowing by 60%. The tractor that uses this technology can cultivate 100 acres instead of 40 acres at the same cost, as Al-Shoufi told "SANA News Agency".

<p class="MsoNormal">The machine consists of two parts: a seed drill and a plow.
The seed drill is automatic and suitable for all types of grains and
fertilizers, says Al-Shoufi. He adds that he obtained a patent for this innovation
in 2002, as it combines both sowing and collecting functions in one device, and
it works accurately in both rough and flat terrains.<o:p></o:p></p>
