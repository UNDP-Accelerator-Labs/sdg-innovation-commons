This app is the product of a joint innovation challenge held in partnership with UNDP's Peace and Community Cohesion project, the AccLab and South Sudan Peace and Reconciliation commission. The winning team who are being supported to realise the concept used pictographic buttons to allow for the largely illiterate grassroots users to report cases of violence at the community level. The winning team developing the app is called STEM.
