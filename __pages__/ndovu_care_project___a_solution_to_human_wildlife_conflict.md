Developed by 17-year-old Sandra Maryanne, the Ndovu Care device offers a solution to human-wildlife conflict, a common phenomenon to communities living adjacent to Tsavo National Park which compromises the food and economic security of subsistence farmers. The portable device consists of a GSM card, a motion detector, a warning light and a siren. The gadget can detect an elephant at a radius of 180 meters after which it sends alerts to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) as well as villagers, preparing them to act before the animals start destroying crops or making their way to habited areas. The warning messages are sent to individuals whose phones are linked to the GSM card. The sensors are capable of detecting the presence of an elephant and immediately alerting people by setting off flash lights and a siren, besides sending warning messages to KWS and villagers' phones.
