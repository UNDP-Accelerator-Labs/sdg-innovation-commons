This local start-up was found in Luang Prabang in the northern part of Lao PDR. It is not a novel innovation in the world, but it is new to be produced and used in the country. The idea was introduced by the Indian tourists who visited the park which aimed to become environmentally friendly. At first, they planned to ban the use of plastic containers in their activity park, but it has received high interests for businesses in tourism sector. 
Issue they want to solve: 
Leaf plates and containers are optimal alternative plastic and polymer-based products. Most bamboo, palm, and areca sheaths are abandoned or burned everywhere. Therefore, the local villagers are encouraged to collect and sell these sheaths to exchange for some income.
Potential expansion: 
There is a possibility to produce machines with different moles in Lao PDR by collaborating with Faculty of Engineering, Technical Vocational Colleges. The initiative can turn into Sustainable Business Model by generating income in the community and creating jobs by forming a group or cooperative. It can be connected with other development projects in country and the region which support the production of rattan and bamboo and livelihoods for income generation scattering across the countries by government and NGOs.
