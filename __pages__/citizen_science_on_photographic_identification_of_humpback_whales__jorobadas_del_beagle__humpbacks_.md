## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Collaboratively identify and analyze ecological aspects of humpback whales that enter the Beagle Channel in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. 
## Specific goals

Determine the number, size, life cycle characteristics, and population trends of humpback whales entering the Beagle Channel. 

Analyze the habitat use, migratory patterns, site fidelity, and length of stay of animals in the area. 

Identify if the Beagle humpback whales come from the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean or if they enter from both populations. 
## Description of citizen participation

This initiative combines systematic surveys during regular boat outings organized by the team with records obtained by the crews and passengers of local tourist boats. Citizens send, by email and social media, the photographic and film records collected with the date on which they were obtained. Through these records, different specimens can be differentiated, mainly based on the color pattern of the ventral side of their caudal fin.
