Girls for Change Programme

> Brief description of the innovation

The Girls for Change programme is a sport for social change project aimed at empowering girls in and outside sport. The programme will engage 100 athletes (girls) from different sporting organizations and communities of Lusaka, between the ages of 15 to 24 years. It will help empower them by training them to be technical officials in their respective sporting disciplines as well as trainings in baking, weaving, fashion and designing, make up and  decor making. They will also be exposed to leadership skills and positions, as well as a chance to interact with women role models in Zambia for motivation and boosting their confidence. 
Educational and health sessions will be taught during their sports programmes about different issues that affect them. The programme will run for 8 months and will be implemented at OYDC, Lusaka.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

One of the services that OYDC offers is the hiring out of its facilities for events such as weddings, conferences and workshops. This entails the need for other services providers such as caterers, make up artists, designers and decorators for the venue. By training our athletes in these fields, we will be able to offer package deals which will include all the skills that our athletes have learnt. In so doing, we will be lessening on the need to outsource these services and therefore bring in more income to the centre. 
The prize will help in the implementation of the project as it will allow us to hire qualified instructors who will conduct training which will enable the athletes to attain the necessary skills. 
Once the athletes have been equipped with these skills, they will be able to contribute favourably to the development of not only their communities but the country at large. 
Part of the training will be based on the use of recycled plastic to make artefacts such as bags, hats and mats. This will help in environmental conservation and protection as the plastics which will be used in the projects will be picked from the streets.

> Technical Feasibility

Sport is used as a tool for social Change because it attracts a number Young adolescents and it is easier to teach (life skills) when its associated with fun or if its one’s passion (sports).  The project will harness the power of sport to bring about social change. 
During the project, the girls will be engaged in the following activities: 
- Technical sessions which are meant to train athletes in officiating different sports.
- Education and health sessions on GBV, SRHR, Drug and Alcohol abuse and child protection.
- Life skills in areas such as baking, weaving, fashion and design, make up and décor making. 
Lifestyle and entrepreneurship sessions where athletes will be taught about financial education, leadership skills and future planning.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Girls for Change project is aimed at empowering  girls with the necessary skills that will enable them to be leaders in sports, entrepreneurs  and future role models for their fellow athletes. The knowledge gained will also help them build their self esteem and  become more independent. 
The education and health sessions will enable them to be more cognizant of their bodies and their rights and responsibilities. This will entail their being able to report any forms of abuse or harassments they might face.  
The skills attained during this project will enable the athlete to have life long skills that they can fall back on after sports.
