## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if giving a lower collection fee for those who classify their waste, more people will make a good waste management. It's important to learn if economic incentives are associated with behavior, as expected in the behavioral science literature. We have identified in conversations that one of the reasons people don’t classify waste is because it's not collected, and it's not collected because it's too expensive. However, it’s not clear that these incentives are effective or sustainable.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the collection fee is reduced for those who classify correctly, then more people will classify their waste



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The first step is to select a sample of potential participants to participate in the experiment. Ideally, we should invite twice as many as necessary due to the rejection rate. Also, ideally, people need to be relatively similar in their socioeconomic characteristics. Once the list of participants is available, they will be assigned through a lottery to those who will be offered a 50% discount on the cost of waste collection by correctly separating their waste. Assigning by lottery helps determine the effectiveness of the incentive. An initial measurement of waste classification should be made, either by means of an inspection, an interview/questionnaire, or a diary. At the end of the test period, another measurement of the correct classification of the waste must be made and the award given to those who were offered and made it.
