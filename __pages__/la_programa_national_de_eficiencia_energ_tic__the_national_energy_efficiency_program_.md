> Type of the Solution

Subsidy scheme

> Affected Sector

Households

> Description of the solution

The National Energy Efficiency Program for induction cooking and electric water heating in the residential sector consists of replacing liquified petroleum gas (LPG) stoves with electric induction stoves in Ecuador's residential sector, taking advantage of the availability of electricity generated mainly from renewable sources. The program involves long-term and low-interest loans for users for the purchase of electric stoves and a fixed number of free kilowatt hours monthly and subsidized electricity. The program has so far put induction stoves in 750,000 households in Ecuador. Swapping LPG for electricity from non-fossil sources promotes both reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

> Socio-economic effects

Improved health from indoor air pollution, affordable clean energy

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- national government

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

A recent study shows that emissions and hospitalizations fell 'in lockstep' with electric stove adoption induced by the program https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/ecuador-emissions-and-hospitalizations-fell-lockstep-electric-stove-adoption

On finance: The project is government-funded and involves long-term and low-interest loans to purchase the electric stoves. Additionally, the project participants receive a fixed number of free kilowatt hours monthly and subsidized electricity.
