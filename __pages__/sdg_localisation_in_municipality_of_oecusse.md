## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



SDG Localization in Municipality of Oecusse
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is often the SDG are discussed at policy level but at the community level there is no data that can describe how SDG has been achieved at the community level. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Government of Timor-Leste adopted the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals on September 23, 2015, two days before they were formally adopted by the United Nations at the General Assembly. This Resolution also mandated the formation of an SDG implementation working group to be chaired by the Prime Minister's Office. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs was followed by a resolution of the National Parliament on November 18, 2015. Resolution No. 19/2015 also advised Timor- Leste's Government to connect its planning and budgeting procedures with the SDG’s. Following that, the government issued a directive (Directive No.:038/2015/XII/PM of 22 December 2015) establishing the SDG Working Group, as well as a decree (Government Decree No. 1, 1 December 2015) requiring the SDGs to be incorporated into annual plans and budgets. As part of Accelerator Lab learning cycle program priority for 2023, the current activity is organizing to explore and understanding the process of recognizing. the national and subnational development contexts in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, which includes everything from setting goals and targets to determining the means of implementation and using indicators to measure and monitor progress, as well as raising awareness through advocacy.

Localization refers to both how national and sub-national (local) governments may help accomplish the SDGs through bottom-up activity and how the SDGs can serve as a framework for local development policies. These include collaborative planning, implementation, and evaluation. One of the most important steps in establishing the new agenda in regions and cities is the integration of SDGs into planning at the national and sub-national level (local). Therefore, the local government not only offers improved access to essential services, but also provides an effective platform for the poor, farmers, workers, and women to engage in decision-making and development processes that benefit them.

The works will therefore be attempting to identify what determines the Sustainable Development Goals as a motivating factor for long-term changes in local government, particularly for the development priority of ZEESM in Oecussi.  The team is hoping to be able to develop a proper conclusion to create a detailed analysis of the program in identification of priority program of the region in line with SDG's localization in Oecussi by observing and meeting with certain community groups as well as its stakeholders. The availability of data and community knowledge are viewed as favorable signs for conducting the study, given the different programs and projects that have been carried out in Oecussi by the UNDP and other international organizations. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



the new data source on SDG localization at the community will emerge and this shows how the development outputs have been achieved after so many resources invested through the development programes. This data will help determine how development prgram in Timor-Leste should reposition to the most vulnerable communities in need. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Through achieving SDGs at the community/grassroot level, we can readjust the development commitment to those who needed the most.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What are the values added if the population in Oecusse municipality are aware of their role in achieving SDGs at the community level? ; What are the approaches needed to achieve SDGs?  What are the enabler of localizing SDGs in Oecusse? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



the collective intelligence, horizon scanning and sensemaking are very useful methods to understand the level of understanding of the community about their role in achieving SDGS while solutions mapping is used to map the trends local solutions.  We were still unable to use ethnography during our field survey due management constraints on immersing into the community by lab team. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Currently there is no data on how SDGs have been achieved at the community/grassroots level
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
