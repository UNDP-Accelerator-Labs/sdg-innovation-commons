> Description of the solution

Thick insulation made from bio-based, non-polluting materials. Couple this with double or triple glazing and a fat green roof both insulating and brilliant for biodiversity. Maggie's Centre for cancer patients in Leeds, designed by Heatherwick Studio and built with natural materials. Its roof is covered in plant species native to the woodlands of Yorkshire. Aleph Zero and Rose Baum designed the Children's Village School Boarding facility in Northern Brazil with a large canopy foorf formed by cross-laminated timber to shade the building.
