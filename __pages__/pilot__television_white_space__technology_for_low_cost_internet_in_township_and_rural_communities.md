## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

13 March 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Experimentation

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Digital connectivity for inclusivity: equal opportunity and access to employment, learning, information, communication, etc.  

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

1. Can TVWS Technology provide access to low cost internet in township and rural communities.

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can TVWS Technology provide low cost internet access in communities

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If TVWS technology is successfully installed and implemented in rural and townships, then these communities will have access to low cost internet 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely
- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Using the internet usage data from the network service providers, we will gauge utilization of the internet

2. Interviews and surveys with communities 

3. Assess the availability of internet in the communities (not only utilization, but strength and speed of connectivity, etc.)

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

internet use and availability 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Surveys, interviews, data collection from network service providers, internet quality testing technologies.  

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 years

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
