> Title of the innovation

Biogas Reactor

> Brief description of the innovation

For future energy security and improvement in the use natural resources, the depletion of conventional energy resources such as fossil fuel can be solved by the use of renewable energy sources.The household energy sector in urban Zambia is dominated by charcoal. Over 75% of peri-urban and urban households use charcoal as their primary cooking fuel source, regardless of income. Charcoal is accessible, affordable and the culturally preferred cooking fuel of choice. In the midst of numerous renewable energy sources and their production means is the sustainable generation of biogas through anaerobic digestion technology (waste management). 
Mkushi District is a district of Zambia, located in Central Province. The capital lies at Mkushi. As of the 2010 Zambian Census, the district had a population of 148,814 people, covering a total area of 17,1726 km sq (6,844 sq mi) and a Density of 11/km sq (27 sq mi). The Great North Road runs through Mkushi district, connecting Kapiri Mposhi and Serenje districts. The area is largely undeveloped and home to numerous natural attractions including Lunsemfwa Wonder Gorge, Changwena Falls, and historic Fort Elwes. Agriculture and cattle farming are one of the most common activities in the greatest part of the region with 70% of the people involved in it, leading to a high availability of organic waste and feedstock all over the year. 
Due to geographical conditions that the district experiences, fuel and fertilizer reaches the rural areas at a time when the end price is relatively expensive due to transport costs, leaving people to find alternative resources other than charcoal and firewood, which is the main source of energy. Cooking activities account for 90% of energy consumption in the rural areas.
Anaerobic digestion is a microbial process whereby organic carbon are converted by subsequent oxidation and reductions to its most oxidized state (CO2) and reduced form (CH4). It is a biological route that is catalyzed by the activities of microorganism in the absence of oxygen . Biogas is a gaseous fuel obtained from waste fermentation, which is of interest in producing energy for electricity, cooking, heating, and biofuels for vehicles. The production of biogas from waste fermentation offer some additional benefits, namely, reduction in pathogens, foul odor, and methane emission from landfill sites where these wastes are ordinarily disposed. Anaerobic digestion of organic waste in digesters occurs in four stages, namely, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis in a system called biogas digester. These four stages results in production of biogas comprising of methane (55–70%) and carbon dioxide (30–45%) with traces of other gases such as hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Interestingly, biogas is considered a low carbon fuel source, which is of interest to rural communities in meeting their energy need for cooking.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Provision of proper orientation and knowledge will help alleviate the problems of energy provision on Mkushi District. The design and implementation of working models in the rural community in the district will provide a means of converting waste to wealth, this if the knowledge is properly disseminated, it will serve as a means of generating income for the unemployed youths in the society this reducing the level of poverty and crime thereby creating a better Mkushi District, Central Province and Zambia as a whole.
Biogas is a viable and alternative source of energy that is affordable, readily available, environmentally friendly and simple to generate using a biogas is reactor from waste (cow dung).
By converting cow manure into methane - biogas, through anaerobic digestion, the hundreds of cows in many parts of the country will be able to produce one hundred million kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to power hundreds of homes across the country. Other monetory uses include as listed; inexpensive solution to problem of rural fuel shortage; improvement in the standard of living of rural communities in small scale industries; residual sludge is applied as top dressing; good soil conditioner and inorganic residue useful for land reclamation.
Engineers face increasing pressure to manage and utilize waste (whether of animal, human or municipal origin) in a sustainable way. I suggest that a solution to the problem of organic waste in rural communities lies in their being able to convert it to biogas technology. This would offer smallholders and farmers a long-term, cheap and sustainable energy source that is independent of the national electricity grid. However, although the technology involved in making biogas from waste has already been fully developed, there are obstacles impeding its adoption. First, there is a general ignorance about this source of energy among the very people who can most benefit from using it. Second, at present, Mkushi District has no regulatory framework to support the installation of biodigesters.
The research focused on the current gap between knowledge and need. The two objectives were raising general awareness of the many and varied benefits that biodigestion can offer, especially to rural communities, and demonstrating how it works. Using science events as a platform, the team introduced the concept of biodigestion, its functioning and uses, to their audiences, and then invited informal responses, which were recorded. The second stage, the case study, entailed the setting up of a small-scale (10 m3) household biodigester in the rural community in Kasokota - Mkushi District, It was put into operation, using fresh cow dung as the feed. Members of the community were invited to watch every step of the process and afterwards were asked to participate in a more formal survey, which sought their opinions on whether biodigestion offers a power source the individual farmer could (and would) use.
The results presented in this innovation study were derived from a comparison of the ‘before-and-after-installation’ responses of the persons interviewed. I found that the members of the rural community who had been involved in both phases of the case study (explanation followed by experience of a hands-on educational example) had become more willing to adopt the technology.
The results justified my contention that, to ensure a greater adoption of biogas technology in mkushi, it is necessary to provide targeted communities with educational programmes and exposure to pilot plants.

> Technical Feasibility

Biogas digesters are mostly designed and constructed using bricks, cement, metals, and reinforced concrete, while in some cases, the dome of the gas holder is made up of fiberglass. These biogas digesters encounter some challenges such as leakages at the edges of the brick structure after a short period of operation. There are some few biogas digester designs that utilize reinforced plastic; however, some of the reinforced plastic of the biogas digester deteriorates and creates holes due to the effect of ultraviolet (UV) radiations. Furthermore, the effect of corrosion that mostly occurs in biogas digesters built from metals results in their failure. In addition to the limitations aforementioned, the construction of the biogas digester using bricks or cement block is quite expensive due to high labor cost and materials. To overcome these weaknesses and challenges associated with the various materials mentioned, an alternative construction material was investigated in this study. Therefore, to minimize the high cost of construction of these previous designs, a more cost-effective design is proposed. Thus, the study employed a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic to fabricate the digestion chamber and bricks/cement for the construction of inlet and outlet chambers. The choice of a plastic for the study is based on it being noncorrosive, a good insulator, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. The uniqueness of the present study stem from the use of composite materials (bricks/cement and plastic). Another factor that made the present study different from previous design is the subjection to the ventilation test to ensure leak free, which will result to more biogas yield and production. The introduction and use of this technology involving composite materials will help to generate biogas for research purposes and serve as a perfect fertilizer used in the university farm; all these motivated the need for this study. Therefore, the study fills this knowledge gaps existing in biogas digester designs, hence making it easier to consider a composite material for biogas digester design. The aim of the study was to design and fabricate a biogas digester using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as an alternative material of construction/fabrication. The detailed knowledge of the design equations and the nature of material used in the construction of the biogas digester will be helpful to the energy engineer, researcher, and academic contributions to the development of biogas technology. Hence, the objective of the study is to formulate a design equation used for the construction of the biogas digester and to carry out a ventilation test to certify the digester a leak free one, which is not usually common in previous studies.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Although conversion of waste to biogas is an established technology, it has been under-used, probably because until recently, electricity was relatively affordable to most of the population in Mkushi. However, the increase in both the demand for, and the cost of, electricity has prompted engineers to revive their interest in rolling out biogas technology in Zambia.
A salient reason for advocating biodigestion as an alternative source of energy is that electricity is not available in all parts of this country. Approximately 2.328 million households, estimated by Triebel and Damm  as representing 55–70% of Zambian families, meet their energy needs with traditional fuels such as firewood and charcoal. Most of this group live in deprived circumstances in the urban slums and rural areas but have no knowledge of biogas technology.
The overarching purpose of the innovation research during this project was to test the hypothesis that if biogas can be fully exploited, it can supply a means of overcoming energy poverty in rural Zambian communities like those in Mkushi District.
The author reasoned that in order to introduce biogas to Mkushi residents who lack access to a power supply, the first requirement must be to introduce them to the concept of biogas, and the second to teach them how the technology works. I started the process by identifying rural communities that did not have access to electricity, with a view to introducing them to the nature and functioning of biodigesters. A collaborative approach was applied throughout, and community members were asked for their views and queries about biodigestion both before and after the pilot digester had been commissioned.
It is worth noting that my project was in alignment with bio-economy strategy, which aims to promote bio-innovations to achieve a sustainable economy based on biological resources, materials and processes. The production of biogas is also synchronous with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially goal numbers 1 and 7, which require that this technology can help reduce socio-economic poverty by providing clean energy that from renewable sources. Zambia is also signatory to the Kyoto protocol, which undertakes to cut greenhouse gas emissions back by 34% by the year 2020 and 45% by 2030.
Due to the current energy shortages and cost of raising capital in the country, it is likely that the Zambia electricity supply company (ZESCO) will be unable to continue expanding its network into the rural areas. This has given impetus to the search for alternative energy sources. Biogas offers a cheap, renewable and viable solution to the problem of providing energy to rural communities and farmers  and also has the merit of using waste that has been traditionally regarded as useless, as the feedstock.
The technology involved in biogas production is fairly simple and can be implemented cheaply and efficiently by means of small-scale digesters that are easy to use and maintain. These household biodigesters can offer benefits to all spheres of society but have a particular bearing on the needs of farmers in rural areas. They can use the gas produced for cooking and lighting, for charging batteries from running biogas generators, and for fertilizing crops with the residual waste.
Another reason for identifying this group as most suitable for putting the biodigestion technology into practice is that small farmers generally have free access to livestock waste, which provides feedstock for the digester. Normally, rural households use the raw manure obtained from their animals as a form of plant fertilizer, but this has a lower organic nitrogen content than the slurry created by the biogas digestion process  which is odourless, and makes a better fertilizer.
Also, the combustion of biogas provides a clean source of energy, as it does not produce soot, like firewood. This helps reduce indoor air pollution, which in turn prevents respiratory infections and associated diseases. According to an evaluation by Pal in India, a biogas digester producing 2 m3 of biogas per day can replace approximately 270–300 kg of firewood per month, depending on the quality of the biogas. Studies of the domestic use of biogas carried out in rural areas in Zimbabwe and Kenya also found that using biogas for cooking was more time-efficient than conventional fuels, and this was a key factor in the willingness of people to adopt it. Although time is required to collect waste and feed the digester, it is a much shorter period than the equivalent required to gather firewood and charcoal.
