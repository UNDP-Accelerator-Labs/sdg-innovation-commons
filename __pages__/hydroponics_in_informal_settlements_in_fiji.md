## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Test the viability of a hydroponic kit for those who live in informal settlements with limited land and resources

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If hydroponics is an viable option suited for informal settlements, they will have greater access to food and will be increasingly food secure. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Informal settlements in Fiji were particularly hit hard during COVID-19. They had limited land to benefit from government support. In our exploration with UN Habitat, we identified the need for increased food access, availability and affordability. Hydroponic kits could be a potential solution serving the interim and possibly long-term needs of households in the informal settlements. We opted for Deep Water Culture (DWC) kits, which are mobile, compact, easy to build at home and scalable without high capital expenditure. The aim was to provide an avenue for growing nutritious food right at their doorstep. After understanding food habits, we narrowed down on cabbage which was versatile in its use across multiple ethnic communities and filled the nutrition gap when food supplies were low. We selected 50 households in five informal settlements across three locations using a stratified sampling method. Most of the selected households had demonstrated interest in growing their own food and were actively involved in soil farming.  After training in using hydroponics, each family was given a kit with 12 seedlings and nutrients to be mixed in water.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

50% time of solutions mapper and experimenter
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

If hydroponics is an viable option suited for informal settlements, they will have greater access to food and will be increasingly food secure. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Vendor selection is critical as it needs to be someone with a growth mindset willing to be an equal partner in the experimentation

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

9 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

20000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This experiment was supposed to scale with UNDP REACH program and UN Habitat 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not at this point

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Financial viability is limited as the market is dominated by 1 player supplying nutrients. This model could work with a "product as a service" model.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

COVID 19 and two cyclones

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP Reach project and Ridge to Reef

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

UN Habitat through their support to informal settlements

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

iterations were required due to two cyclones and lockdown periods due to covid. We relied more on qualitative data as quantitative data collected was not relevant due to shifting timelines. Additionally, a lot of plants were destroyed during the cyclone due to which two informal settlements could not participate in the full study.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Financial feasibility of participants is key. Additionally, easy availability of hydroponic nutrients is a must.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this can be tried at a community level where it will be more financially viable. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Limited exploration as we did not have an explorer. However, learning more about different hydroponic methods would have been more useful which would have reduced reliance on vendor.

> What surprised you?

Several positive deviants were men in the community
