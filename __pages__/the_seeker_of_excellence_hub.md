> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation help the Zambian communities especially the Youths who live in areas that are marred with so much hindrances of realizing their full potential in this life. This novel will will not only give the targeted communities and population an opportunity to realize that they too can make it in life despite the circumstances or conditions in which they live. 
This innovation will generate income by embarking on various entrepreneural activities &amp; projects that will also be used as training platforms for it's members.  This will be done by soliciting for funding from meaningful organizations and well wishers who will receive reports of how their funding was used. 
The challenge prize will help us buy equipments that will help us realise our objectives such as buying a house to be used as an office, office computers &amp; other utility assets,  training facilities and games that will attract young people,  payments for volunteer workers to mention but a few.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is designed to address the various challenges  and problems of society that are not paid attention to often times, yet they contribute to national underdevelopment of our country Zambia. 
The proposed implementation plan is that the innovation will target the youths and adolescents who seem to be mostly neglected by our society to realize their potential of life on their own unaided. It will also focus on school going learners in the afternoon session who mostly think they are failures and are busy going to school to fulfill the demands of their parents, what their peers are doing and to do what society demands of them as opposed to going to school for the importance attached to it and in a pursuit to realise their full potential as human beings regardless of their social status in society. The same will be the target for people living with disabilities (PDWs) and the vulnerable children especially  girls who are mostly neglected, abused and harased in and by the targeted communities. 
All these will be achieved by registering or recruiting members in such similar situations or setups of life for training in those areas and then deploying them as teams in the community to disseminate the information and recruit more members for trainings and deployment. 
This will at times include parental trainings or adult education, community gate-keepers and stakeholders trainings and meetings in a bid to attain their support in the implementation of this innovation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the lives of others through change of modes of thinking,  motivation of those who at least already have courage to make it through their life of hardships and championing the perceptions towards people living with disability, child development, the environment and engaging organizations especially  the government to pay attention to the hindrances of these unplanned settlements and densely populated areas in Zambia. 
This is important as it will help the goverment of Zambia and other meaningful institutions like UNDP,  World Vision, Amnesty international to mention but a few to realize their objectives as well.
