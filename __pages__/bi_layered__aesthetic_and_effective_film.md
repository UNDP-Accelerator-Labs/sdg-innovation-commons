> Description of the solution

This Innovative material uses passive daytime radiative cooling, which means that it emits its heat into space without being absorbed by the air or atmosphere. The result is a surface that can be several degrees cooler that the air around it without using any electrical power. The researchers layered colorful cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with a white-coloured material made from ethyl cellulose, creating a bi-layered film that was both robust and effective. When placed under sunlight the films were an average of nearly 40 degrees Fahrenheits cooler than surrounding ambient air.  Generates 120 Watts of cooling power, rivaling many types of residential air conditioners.
