Description: The Aqualonis system is easy to install and is carbon neutral, as it does not use energy for its operation. Through their ultra-thin high-tech meshes, they extract the water that is in the air and collect it in containers that store the liquid ensuring that the quality is optimal for human consumption.   

Interesting features: It is a method that not only captures water from the air but filters it so that it is suitable for human consumption. It is perfect for communities living in mountainous areas where it is difficult to bring water through pipes.
