> Title of the innovation

Computerist and technology

> Brief description of the innovation

Technological innovation influences organizational populations profoundly by disrupting markets, changing the relative importance of resources, challenging organizational learning capabilities, and altering the basis of competition (see Technology and Organization). Supporting Schumpeter's characterization of technological innovation as a process of creative destruction, research supports the idea that technologies evolve over time through cycles of long periods of incremental change, which enhance and institutionalize an existing technology, punctuated by technological discontinuities in which new, radically superior technologies displace old, inferior ones, making possible order-of-magnitude or more improvements in organizational performance.

Success in business comes down to one's ability to build and maintain extraordinary relationships.
