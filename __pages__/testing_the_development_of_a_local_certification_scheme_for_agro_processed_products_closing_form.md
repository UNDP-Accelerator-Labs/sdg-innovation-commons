## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The development of the Local Certification Scheme was a product and a component of the Buy Swazi Campaign which was initiated with the purpose of learning about the barriers that MSMEs face in accessing local markets. One of the key insights from the Buy Swazi experiment was that the lack of access to certification of products with essential health and safety standards was one of the barriers that made it difficult for agro-processed products to gain access to formal retail markets. The Lab further learnt that even with dedicated support to help MSMEs access the required product certification, the cost of certification is one of the most significant barriers to certification. These costs can go as high as $12,000.00 per product. The Lab then brought together relevant partners and MSMEs to try and work out scenarios that would reduce the cost of certification, which led to a reduction to a minimum of $1,300.00. However, it was further learnt that this cost was still too high for the local MSME. As such, a much more economically friendlier option was required, hence the Lab set out to work with the local standards authority (the Eswatini Standards Authority), the Ministry of Commerce’s SME Unit as well as Quality and Infrastructure Department, and others to design a more accessible scheme that would make it easier for locally produced agro-processed products to access local retail markets for a start.

The lab further learnt that most MSMEs have challenges putting in place a Quality Management System which is one of the major requirements for certification. As such, agro-processed products remain in the informal sector because of a lack of a proper quality management system. The biggest challenge in doing this lies especially with the availability of processing facilities which have to be separate from domestic activities, something many Micro and Small businesses do not have access to. Part of the development of this scheme was to simplify the process to allow businesses to use home based processing facilities, as long as they met certain minimum standards like being separate from domestic activities and adhering to certain basic health, safety and sanitation standards.&nbsp;

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bottlenecks experienced was the difficulty in bringing the relevant partners to agree on an approach to make certification more accessible to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME). One of the biggest challenges here is that the standards body is underfunded and depends on certification proceeds to sustain itself, hence a reduction of costs means a reduction in their incomes as well

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The country has struggled to bring together the resources and partners that are necessary in solving this challenge. A previous effort by government and partners to support MSMEs to get certification for their products was inhibited by the high costs of certification. With this in mind, the Acclab brought together the relevant partners to agree to work on the development of a simplified scheme that would be used to capacitate local MSMEs and allow their products to penetrate local markets. 3.&nbsp;<span lang="EN-ZA" style="text-indent: -18pt; font-size: 1rem; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif;">The policy environment does not allow for the growth of local
industries and the AccLab has lobbied for changes in that space as well. It is
expected that such the new SME policy will highlight some considerations that
will help promote local products in the market. 4.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-ZA" style="text-indent: -18pt; font-size: 1rem; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; font-family: &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif;">There is a heightened of lack on understanding amongst micro
businesses about the role played by certification of products in product
development. MSME’s tend to think that retailers look down on their products
yet that are quality assurance concerns.&nbsp;
There is a need to educate upcoming businesses on the importance of
quality assurance.</span><p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-bottom:3.75pt;mso-add-space:auto;

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These were used to bring together the relevant stakeholders in the co-design of a locally appropriate solution to the challenge of MSMEs being unable to access local retail markets.&nbsp;

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These innovation methods assisted us in co-designing with partners and users a solution that would be context appropriate and simplified for local users. Normal certification schemes in the country are based on vey stringent and hard to reach international standards even for local products
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

SEDCO is a government owned company established to create, develop, and promote (MSMEs) in the Kingdom of Eswatini. They exist primarily to stimulate homegrown entrepreneurship with sustainable economic growth through entrepreneurship development and growth. SEDCO has several programmes which inter-alia include business incubation, market facilitation, one household one product campaign and capacity building on business and product development. They were therefore a key stakeholder in the development of the certification scheme for local products and will provide the necessary experience and technical advice during the development and testing of the scheme.&nbsp;

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Eswatini Standards Authority (SWASA) is another strategic government company that provides capacity support to MSME’s through product development as it relates to standards.&nbsp; Specifically, SWASA facilitates the use of standards to reduce technical barriers to trade and investment and to provide technical support for MSME’s and industrial development in order to ensure a sustainable Eswatini economy. they are the main partner and will have the responsibility of leading the development of the local certification scheme

&nbsp;

The Ministry of Commerce Industry and Trade - SME Unit - As the government department responsible for oversight responsibility over MSME related issues the SME Unit has been identified as one of the main partners for this experiment, mostly because of their policy role in MSME development. the plan is that they will be able to facilitate an appropriate policy environment for upscaling of the tested solutions

&nbsp;

The Ministry of Commerce Industry and Trade - Regulatory and Quality Infrastructure Department - This department is responsible for oversight for all government departments working on the issue of quality and safety standards. this includes testing labs, metrology, etc and is key in bringing together all the resources required for the development of a local certification scheme&nbsp;

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

SEDCO as a private sector was an unusual partner for UNDP

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None
