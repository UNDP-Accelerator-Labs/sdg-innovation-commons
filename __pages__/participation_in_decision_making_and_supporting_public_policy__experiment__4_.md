## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to understand whether people who have closer proximity to decision making are more supportive of environmental policies. This is because it is not clear if greater exposure to the challenges in decision making make people more critical or more understanding of their limitations. 



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF people participate in decision making spaces; THEN, they will have greater support for environmental policies. 



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test the hypothesis, we will

use secondary public opinion data provided by LAPOP in 2019

(www.LapopSurveys.org). This has a representative sample. We will test the

hypothesis analytically using econometric techniques. The independent variable

is whether respondents have attended a municipal meeting in the past 12 months,

and weather people have attended meetings for improving the community.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

People



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Secondary public opinions from surveys 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One day



> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

This is a low-cost experiment. The data and software used were free, with open access. It does require someone with the required data analysis techniques and a capable computer. The analysis must have taken around 5 hours to complete. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partially proven. We did not find evidence that participating in municipal meetings increases support for increased spending for improving prevention of natural disasters, but we did find increased support among those who attend community meetings. 



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

There are many limitations in

using secondary data. The questions available may not be valid enough to test the

hypothesis. Also, a more rigorous econometric method should be used to test the

hypothesis using ordinal variables, although we did consider the survey design

when estimating the models. Also, analytical techniques try to approach a

ceteris paribus approach used in experimentation; yet this does not address

issues accounted by random assignment. For example, people who participate in

decision making activities self-select themselves into those spaces and may

have fundamentally different characteristics that other people and attitudes

from before exposure to decision making spaces.



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than one month.



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00 in additional resources (internet or electricity at most). 



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We used these results to define the question for the next learning cycle. Why do people adopt environmental practices?



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

It is planning to scale in

several ways. Its results will be used for the next cycle. The methodology will

be transferred to local governments and the ministry of environment so they can

discover what works, instead of only providing them with the results. 



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment influenced public policy at a national or local level
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We know that we can't rule out that some forms of participation in decision making spaces can be associated with increased support for environmental policies. 



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Communicating the results to

create interest, particularly to develop/transfer capacity to implement these

methodologies using open data. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The environmental programmatic

area, because they are interested in drivers of support for environmental

policies; but also, all areas that can make use of methods to analyze open data

with open-source software.



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The municipalities and ministry of environment, who are interested in drivers of environmental policies, and have incentives to increase participation in decision making spaces; as well as using the methodologies. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No, there are no added benefits known in additional iterations. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Reach out if you'd like to access

the code to replicate it. Using R may require a learning curve. These types of

analysis are not easy to communicate to people without technical knowledge. One

must be aware of the limitations of using secondary data in the validity of

results. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, we can replicate this way of testing hypothesis, and it could be useful to test if participation in decision making spaces is associated with support of policies in non-environmental topics. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The selection of the hypothesis to test was a direct result from exploration and mapping activities. We prioritize together based on the opportunities to link grassroots solutions and new sources of data. 



> What surprised you?

It is surprising that people who participate in decision-making spaces aren't more critical.
