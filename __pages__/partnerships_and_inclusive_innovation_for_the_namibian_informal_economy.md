## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Partnerships and Inclusive Innovation  for the Namibian Informal Economy

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that  youth unemployment is rising; alongside the proportion of  women and vulnerable groups who continue to remain left behind especially in terms of occupying traditional and full time positions in the formal economy.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The informal economy is a major source of employment and livelihoods in many countries and it interacts closely with the formal economy. lnformal  economy workers in Namibia are youth, the population majorly affected by our country's unemployment rate. The Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) put the country's national unemployment rate at 34%, and for the youth, it is a whopping 43,8%. The situation is probably more dire in rural areas, where formal job creation is almost zero. Comparable research suggests that nine in 10 rural workers in Africa have informal jobs.

Street vendors, kapana vendors, domestic workers, wood-covers, men on the side of the roads, cattle herders and off-the-radar cash workers are the major operators in the informal industry. They are in addition to facing a multitude of socioeconomic challenges are often marginalized and come from a community which places them at further disadvantage. Government has attempted to support this broad and diverse target audience with substantial support and intervention from other development partners.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator lab has found some new and unusual partners who could teach us more about this challenge.


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

AccLabNam embarks on a sensemaking exercise with NISO, NSDF, NHAG and the youth to understand the barriers to entrepreneurship development in Namibia.

UNDP, through its accelerator Lab was approached by NISO, who commissioned a study on the informal sector.  We have, though the interviews conducted that the informal economy is untapped but requires assistance at many levels to add long term and sustainable economic value in the future.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we learn from the youth and the informal settlements they are living in, to better support their dreams, aspirations and contribute to their livelihoods?


> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will engage the youth in supporting them through training, connecting them to the private sector and other possible partners to help them establish their own businesses.  This will be done through a process of solutions mapping and also co-creation, but in the process will highlight the 10 as positive deviants in their community.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These will help in assessing to what extent Namibia can leverage the insights gained from mobile data but also how the data relates to ethnographic and citizen data collected.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Ministry of Industrialization, the Ministry of Youth, the Ministry of Labor and finally the Ministry of Higher Education will all benefit from the insights.  It is however important to build the solutions based on the needs of the youth in the informal settlments, hence the approach is bottom up.
