Financial inclusion and gender, digital inclusion
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

From our previous loop on financial inclusion there were two remaining challenges. One challenge is strengthening the capabilities of women in the financial realm, meaning supporting them to plan and administer their incomes, start or develop their small business and more generally being financially autonomous. The second challenge is related to digital inclusion because it has shown crucial to foster financial inclusion of the low income population. So, we are thinking  how to foster digital inclusion to give more tools to the low income population and, at the same time, decentralize cities and strengthen  community markets. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Our 2021 challenge is how to empower women through financial inclusion. Financial inclusion is an enabler of several SDGs. It is widely recognized as critical to reduce poverty and promote inclusive economic growth. A considerable body of research highlights that financial inclusion helps people to start and expand their businesses, invest in education, promote gender equality, facilitate day to day living, absorb economic shocks, increase resilience, among others.   The birth of financial inclusion could be related to modern micro-finance, which occurred in India in the mid-1970s when Dr. Muhammad Yunus found a solution for poor rural women. Later, he founded The Grameen Bank. Given its success, in the 1980s several micro-finance institutions appeared around the world.  There are several causes related to financial exclusion, i.e.: the lack of access to traditional banking (that pushes poor people to use other mechanisms with exorbitant fees); the lack of trust in traditional systems and its inadequate offer for low and medium-income households; the informal economy which includes activities, enterprises, jobs, and workers, etc. Because of financial exclusion, poor people suffer from social, economic and financial consequences. For example, they spend a lot of money conducting transactions and are more vulnerable to financial shocks. Women have fewer economic opportunities; in other words, women are more likely to be poor than men. Among other reasons, many women are dependent upon their husbands or have no control over household spending on significant purchases.  Besides, women often have more limited educational and employment opportunities, and so on. Financial inclusion is a powerful way to empower women.  Also, and beyond gender, the digital revolution has shown new opportunities to promote financial inclusion, such as digital currencies and wallets, mobile payments, etc. Kenya has become the worldwide leader of financial inclusion because of the success of its mobile money model, which has a high adoption rate. Many players are involved in this problem such as governments, traditional banking, fintech companies, civil society organizations, international organizations, academia and, of course, people in general. We mapped a solution in our first loop that inspired us to scale it in a partnership with a municipal government.

"In Argentina poverty has the face of a young woman. They are in the most critical situation."- Ministry of Social Development (December, 2019): https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/en-argentina-la-pobreza-tiene-cara-de-joven-y-de-mujer According to the National Survey of Household Expenditures 2017/18 (National Institute of Statistics and Censuses, Argentina), less than 25% of household consumption in Argentina is made through digital means of payment (debit card, credit, bank transfers or virtual wallets).https://www.indec.gob.ar/indec/web/Nivel4-Tema-4-45-151

Nowadays, more than 35% of the Argentine population lives in poverty, many workers are not registered with the authorities, and a large part of its citizens is severely indebted. In this context, people from low-income households, due to the lack of alternatives, fall into low-cost and high-rate predatory loan schemes, which have intimidating and even dangerous payment systems, among other perverse consequences. Furthermore, there is a significant gap between what people need and what banks offer them. So, there is also an opportunity to find solutions that help to promote access and use appropriate and responsible  financial services (savings, loans, insurances, transactions, among others). In other words, to promote innovation for those who have been excluded from the traditional system. There are emerging and unprecedented financial inclusion challenges due to the pandemic, i.e., money transfers to poor households or small/ medium-sized enterprises, digital payments, e-commerce, among others.  Why are we focusing our attention on women? Because female-headed households are more likely to fall into poverty. Why community markets? The reason is twofold. On one hand, a previous experiment gave evidence on the higher likelihood that people learn from their peers (such neighbors or parents). On the other hand, also community markets have been seriously affected by the long lockdown.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

In 2020 Argentina AccLab developed a learning cycle on financial inclusion. We found some key elements to be considered when creating public policies: 1) Trust: within the low-income population, interpersonal trust is on the base of any learning process and in the likelihood of the adoption of any financial tool. Therefore, trust should be an input for the design of financial instruments for low-income populations. 2) User experience: the success of any financial solution, product, or service should be simple, intuitive, and inexpensive. 3) Learning by doing: learning derived from practice is the most valued by people, instead of theoretical training. 4) Segmentation: solutions that work for some people may not meet the needs of another. 5) Infrastructure: it is necessary to work on how to develop financial tools accessible for people at neighbourhood level to reduce inequalities. Besides, the Argentina AccLab has been developing a portfolio of actions with different strategies and players, using innovative methodologies associated with the loop such as:  1) UNV project (internal grant and potential scaling) with two phases: solutions mapping with ten young volunteers from across the country, and decentralized acceleration with 150+ volunteers across 15 countries 2) Pay in Advance, Cash without Account and other social media campaigns  3) Financial education in Meal centers All these give place to two important partnerships for mapping and scaling  a) With the Gender Area of UNDP Argentina, we will implement a project that won the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi-Partner Trust Fund, along with the National Direction of Economy, Equality and Gender from the National Ministry of Economy ,UN Women, ILO and ECLAC. b) “Red Con vos” (“With you” network) in partnership with the Municipality of Concepción, Entre Rios. Local markets and digital inclusion. 4) UNA Project: solutions mapping with the help of a National University, regarding the financial inclusion and economical activities of low income women, during and after the pandemic,.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What do women from low-income households need in terms of financial services and products? What works for them?   How we can foster digital inclusion, decentralization and the development of community markets at once? Which is the best means to empower and encourage low income population to use digital tools already available to prevent them being exposed to the covid 19 when they do these tasks in person? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are doing fieldwork. We conducted interviews and focus groups. Also, through collective intelligence exercises, we will seek to think of interventions where women can exchange their experiences. We will use a behavioral insights approach to conduct a field experiment to test what lead people using the services of the “con vos” network and what are its effects on: digital inclusion, decentralization and community markets. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The down-top approach from which we started allows better results when refering to solutions that should be accepted and applied by the people. That is why, we propose to accelerate the economical and financial strategies that women thought and apply everyday. 

We found some key elements to be considered when creating public policies: 1) Trust: within the low-income population, interpersonal trust is on the base of any learning process and in the likelihood of the adoption of any financial tool. Therefore, trust should be an input for the design of financial instruments for low-income populations. 2) User experience: the success of any financial solution, product, or service should be simple, intuitive, and inexpensive. 3) Learning by doing: learning derived from practice is the most valued by people, instead of theoretical training. 4) Segmentation: solutions that work for some people may not meet the needs of another. 5) Infrastructure: it is necessary to work on how to develop financial tools accessible for people at neighborhood level to reduce inequalities.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

National Direction of Economy, Equality and Gender and the Municipal Government of Concepcion. Thanks to the direction of gender we are going to reach the network of “concejalas” female municipal legislator. Also potentially the Con vos Network can be scaled with other municipal governments as well.
