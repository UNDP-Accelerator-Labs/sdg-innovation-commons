## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Tuzlyn Bayoh & Mariatu Gbassay Kanu

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

14th June 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Health and Sanitation 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Period Poverty, the transition from cloth cut-outs to washable pads 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How can innovative solutions developed by young people be supported to the market - creating & enhancing diversification  

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector
- Private Sector
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Minsitry of Health & Sanitation + Ministry of Social Welfare; Limkokwing University; UNWOMEN; 
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To understand whether there can be a market for this product targetting young girls using old clothes (cut-outs) for pads

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If young girls try out the washable pads and it works, if  its cost efficient as compared to disposable with little or no health implications then this solution can be a cost efficient solution to reduce period poverty that is rampant within communities and also reduce the use of cut-outs for managing mentrual cycles with al its related risks

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Collective Intelligence and Focus Group Discussions will play a key role in sourcing information on mentrual period management another action will be the production of the samples for distribution to volunteers. Finally the collection of data via online tool to analyse results and gain insight on behavior and perceptions 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

number of pads distributed, number of cycle data collected

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

daily experience log and final user experience online survey

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Additional time invested in coordination with district volunteering teams 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes based on the user experience feedback 70% of young girls in 4 of 5 distircts using cut-out cloths would be happy to transition to reuseable pads 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

To hold more interviews with participants 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

8 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

200usd

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Some design recommendations were pprovided and the innovator has incoporated them in readiness for the next roll-out to a mix of old volunteers and new volunteers in deprived communities. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Priority space will be the private sector, taking the final product to the market 

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Again young people can adapt external solutions to meet local contextual needs at a cheaper cost

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Delays in UNDP operational processes

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Sustainable Local Economic Development Cluster as this team works to promote youth empowerment & employment and fund start-ups with viable solutions 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

MInistry of Social Welfare as they provide carekits for young people especially young girls

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes especially with the complementary items and packaging. Initial feedback from brainstorming sessions realized that we cant just issue the pads without complementary items that can ease the use of the pads. Secondly there wasn't any formal package for the items and that also was again designed for the experiment. As a result of these requests the distribution was delayed a month for these recommendations from volunteers to be fixed before user testing began

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

If period poverty is a major challenge for young women and girls,  then this solution is a good option to make available to the public. From data collected there were concerns about the washing and airing process especially the airing
