This program seeks to give continuity to the PINFOR project. It aims to promote and encourage the country's forestry development through sustainable forest management and reduce deforestation of forest lands. The conservation of forest cover in Guatemala is promoted through payments to the owners or managers of the forest plantation in question.  


This scheme is for producers with larger tracts of land and applies to areas with a forestry vocation that have a productive objective (firewood).
