## Transforming biomaterial waste to biodegradable packaging

Substrato is a project that transforms agroindustrial waste into biomaterials that can be applied to developing sustainable products. This is achieved thanks to a multidisciplinary process that connects the field with creative and innovative methodologies and local knowledge and infrastructure.


This project was born as an academic exploration that arises from investigating and analyzing agro-industrial residues in Mexico to develop new alternatives for its use and management. This, in turn, implies the development of sustainable products that demonstrate the economic value of organic waste.


The research focused on pineapple leaves, the primary residue in producing this fruit, representing 75% of the harvested product. The waste that served as raw material for the project's development was obtained from Ciudad Isla, Veracruz, one of the key pineapple-producing states in Mexico.From the experiment, four biomaterials were developed (felt, bioplastic, chipboard, and rope), and some applications of the materials made of fiber and pineapple leaf bagasse.
