The objective is to produce clean drinking water in rural Laos. The solar water filter is made of material which can be sourced locally. The filtering part is comprised of stones, sand, resins and charcoals. Apart from that, this system has a part for treating water with UV and O3. The system can be installed in camps of flood victims and can be operated easily by volunteers. Currently, the Faculty of Engineering is testing the water quality in selected areas with its partners. The unit price has not been set.
