> Title of the innovation

Black Charcoal Briquette

> Brief description of the innovation

Black Charcoal Briquette is a kind of an alternative energy source for common charcoal. It's a cheap, sustainable, clean and 
environmental friendly product. It is made from any farm waste product such as maize stalk, rice husk, groundnut peels, and other farm product waste. The waste product is carbonized into char, which is mixed with a binder like cassava paste, or maize paste, mounded and left to dry, and eventually used as fuel for cooking. It burns longer and emits less carbon.
The future is indeed bright as this kind of energy source is affordable, and helps mitigate deforestation, which is cutting down of trees.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income not only for myself but others as well by creating jobs. Food is everyone's basic need, and eating is an everyday exercise, charcoal briquettes will provide a cheap source of energy for Cooking food. The target market is individual families, Restaurant, lodges, Schools, prisons and Hospitals. In each province a Minimum of 50 people will be employed, bringing a total of about 500 across 10 provinces. The challenge prize will greatly help the business grow because 
processing machinery char machine,  charcoal pressing machine and dryers will be bought including, van for transportation thereby maximizing production. 
This product will see a great reduction in use of common charcoal which in return reduce I cutting of trees, save trees and environment. Curb climate change.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in such a way that the farm waste is made into a simple square or cubical charcoal briquette, Which is a good source of energy fuel for cooking.
The source is readily available, accessible and cheap. The market as well is readily available

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will create jobs for others and generate income, and it will provide a cheaper option to the energy fuel source.

The importance of this product is that it will provide a sustainable substitute for convectional charcoal, help with climate change crisis.
