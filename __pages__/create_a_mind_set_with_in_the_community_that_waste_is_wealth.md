Create a mind set with in the community that waste is wealth
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

·       Our Challenge is on how we can create a mind set with in the community that waste is wealth to encourage sorting and build profitable businesses and Simplification of the cumbersome task of solid waste collection in the value chain that can provide decent jobs for the youth. We also gain learnings on the existing waste regulatory frameworks, social, economic, and physical motivation factors and barriers for sound waste management and sorting practices.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Solid waste management (SWM) in an urban area is a complex activity that involves the collection, transportation, sorting, recycling, resource recovery and disposal of solid waste. Municipal solid waste is composed of different wastes generated by households and different institutions such as schools, hospitals, slaughter houses and public toilets. In Ethiopia, the world bank estimates that 50% of the waste generated is collected through the formal municipal waste collection system, and more than 50% of the collected waste is often disposed at uncontrolled landfills. Lack of suitable infrastructure to support the need of growing urban area and population growth, low implementation of regulations, and disinterest from households in sorting waste plague the current system of waste management with low formal recycling, illegal dumping of waste in rivers and open dumping in an over capacity landfill.

Municipal wastes are not well managed due to the alarmingly increasing solid waste production which is more than the capacity of the cities and municipalities. It was reported that, waste collection rates are often lower than 70% in low-income countries and more than 50% of the collected waste is often disposed of through uncontrolled land filling. Ethiopia is one of the low-income countries facing the consequence of improper solid waste management. It was reported that about 20 to 30% of the waste generated in Addis Ababa, the capital city, remains uncollected. Proper solid waste management requires the commitment of the town municipality and the active involvement of the community members. There are many initiatives taking place in Ethiopia to improve the environmental health especially in the capital city. In Addis Ababa the awareness of the community members about solid waste management is enhanced and more than 70% of the community inhabitants were willing to pay for door-to-door solid waste collection service, which is one of the initiatives introduced by the government. Majority of what is collected (83%) is organic waste followed by plastic waste then paper then metal waste.

Generally, Improper solid waste management (SWM) is a major public health and environmental concern in the urban areas of many developing countries. The value chain of solid waste management within the country is not clear because there is a highly active informal sector alongside the formal waste collecting that contributed greatly to recycling and reusing of waste.  Therefore, it is challenging to quantify the amount directly end up in landfill and what goes to recycling at the household and sorting association level. The current stakeholders who are engaged in the solid waste business are environmental agencies, waste collection transportation agencies, sorting and recycling associations, compost making associations, research institutes and municipalities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab aims to bring fast learning related to the sorting behavior through linking the diversified waste product and bring money out of waste. Since most of the waste ends up at the landfill, because of the lack of knowledge but also lack market for sorting associations, we aim to work from the market side through designing different experiments with sorting associations. Bringing innovative local solution on diversified waste products through mapping locally can also be an eye opener for the recycling associations. The most important one is bringing scalable idea for the CO’s projects on municipal composting and integrated solid waste management and Sheger beautification project which is working on rehabilitating of polluted rivers in Addis Ababa. The integrated approach and looking from different perspectives can help generate learning in short period.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

@UNDPAccLab #Ethiopia is mapping waste to livelihood solutions that can create decent jobs and diversify waste recycling and reusing streams.

@UNDPEthiopia’s accelerator lab is experimenting how to encourage waste segregation at households to create effective solid waste management across the value chain.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

A)    Why is waste segregation at low-income households good compared to high-income households? What is creating the positive deviance in this household?

 

B)     What are the different innovative livelihood options and solutions that are using waste to creates jobs?

C)    How can waste collection carts be designed better to support segregated waste collection?

 

D)    What is our customer’s (the municipality, waste collectors and Households) motivations, beliefs, and experience on the desired solutions for the waste management system? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The lab team is organizing a solution fest to show case the solution which use waste as a livelihood method. So, we are planning to map those solutions and organize a solution fest as a learning event and a way to connect actors in the market.

We are also planning to co-create a transportation solution with the waste sorting, collecting, and transporting association and as a follow up activity plan to experiment the solution we co-create with them through prototyping.

We are also using the behavioral insight study looking at positive deviance in waste segregation in low-income households become to build a model for encouraging waste segregation across the city. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

·       Within our experimental behavioral insight study, the lab team plan to analyses and draw insight from Big & Raw data, Ethnography data and Open data.

 

·       Through using Geospatial data (mapping the GPS points of where are the transfer stations and which will enable us to draw an insight if the access and quantity of waste will drive the sorting behavior depending on the quantity, quality and access to the transfer stations, we may also measure the extent of waste recovery, housing density Vs the accommodation capacity of the transfer stations, etc. and other factors that we have learnt so far in connection with transfer stations
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The lab team collaborate with the City Municipality solid waste management agency (Addis Ababa solid waste management agency,  Adama, Bisheftu and Bahirdar  municipalities ) through Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge that they will benefit with their policy and execution strategy on the solid waste management system they are developing. UNDP NAMA compost project is also looking for the insight on how to enhance sorting behaviors with in seven municipalities they are implementing.
