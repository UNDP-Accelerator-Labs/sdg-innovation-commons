## Solution holder: Fayez Al-Khlaifat

The experience begins with a 20-minute presentation, taking you on a journey that illuminates the foundation of our solar system and allows you to travel to all parts of the universe.

As the presentation concludes, the stargazing experience begins across the starlit sky with high-quality telescopes and a brief explanation of reading the stars and navigating.

You will have a night full of stars!
