Foot operated hydroalcoholic gel dispenser

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

At first I was intrigued on the use of piping as a structure to hold the gel bottle, but then, when examining the pipes assembling, realized its function, pushed the lower bar with my foot, and it worked, gel was out! I thought it was very clever to use the spring that already comes in the bottle nozzle as the basic functioning element that enables its working mechanism.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

With recent opening of  commercial operations amidst COVID-19 pandemic, 
entrepreneurs are finding ways to reinforce their biosecurity protocols 
while making costumers feel safe, but sometimes the implementation of 
these measures can be costly. 


This is the case of this small restaurant in the rural area of San Salvador, which has resorted to using PVC piping used for plumbing instead of buying a commercial solution, to build this hydroalcoholic gel dispenser, which is foot operated, thus reducing the risk for covid infection due to drops in surfaces, and also saving costs. The whole mechanism is based in the bottle's own embedded spring in the nozzle.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Everday objects or ready-made solutions, can serve as the base for incremental iterations, while saving resources as not everything has to be made from scratch.
