## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We would like to learn if and how a virtual space for peer-to-peer feedback and reflection for solutions and challenges related to the Sustainable Development Goals, can improve: how the solution holders understand the contribution of their solutions to the SDGs, how to develop further their solutions, generate new and innovative ways of looking at the solution or challenges faced, network and peer-to-peer feedback in relation to the proposed solutions and challenges faced among other aspects.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF... provided a virtual space for peer-to-peer feedback and reflection for SDG-solution holders ... THEN... this will facilitate develoment, confidence, innovation, networking around the solutions and challenges faced.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Solutions (and challenges) in relation to the SDGs will be collected through announcements from two of the bigges radios in the country, and mapped through and online form. The UNDP Accelerator Lab Guinea Bissau, in collaboration with the BMW Herbert Quandt Foundation, will organize an online session: Clínica di Soluson (Solutions Clinic) for Bissau-Guinean participants, who will have the opportunity to present a solution and a challenge they are facing related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The five selected proposals will have the opportunity to present to UN agencies and the BMW Herbert Quandt Foundation's Responsible Leaders Network, in an interactive peer-to-peer session conducted in break-out rooms. After the session, the five solution holders will answer a pre-post survey, rating from 1-5 their feeling sin relation to: how they understand the contribution of their solutions to the SDGs, how to develop further their solutions, possibility of generating new and innovative ways of looking at the solution and challenge, possibility of networking and engaging in peer-to-peer feedback in relation to the proposed solutions and challenges faced among other aspects.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The Lab will analyze the rating in relation to the different aspects looked at, before and after the Solution Clinic Session.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Pre-post survey

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2,5 h online session (2-3 months of initial preparation)

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

2-3 months of preparation and networking
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

During the session we used a methodology developed by the BWM Foundation Herbert Quandt and the Responsible Leaders Network for peer-to-peer feedback and discussion and mindfulness excercises. The methodology is very interesting and allowed for deep, reflecting and trustful discussion. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2-3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

3000 USD for divulgation and interviews at the radios (Radio Jovem and Radio Sol Mansi)

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, We have already conducted two sessions and plan to do a third one in December 2022.For the coming year we also plan to do a collaborative blog together with the BWM Foundation Herbert Quandt as well as a physical networking sessison for the solution holders, the UN Agencies. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, We have already conducted two sessions and plan to do a third one in December 2022, additionally we will connect the virtual space to an ongoing Track 2 project (physical and virtual innovation hub) with colleagues from the Economic Cluster to explore how this can be a permanent space for young Guineans. Additionally, some of the UN agencies has showed interest is scaling single solutions that were proposed during the session.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The methodology and the virtual space created has a big potential of offering support and improve how the solution holders understand the contribution of their solutions to the SDGs, how to develop further their solutions, generate new and innovative ways of looking at the solution or challenge, network and peer-to-peer feedback in relation to the proposed solutions and challenges faced among other aspects. We also saw that the mindfulness excercise (a quite minute to reflect on what have been said) deepened the focus of the discussion and releived stress among the perticipants. Finally the drawing excercise showed how visual thinking and methaphores cna be used to in a deep way describe a thought and at the same time open up for new perspectives.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Internet connection and access to devices among the solution holders, especially those residing in the countryside. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Economic Cluster, the learnings have already been channeled into thir ongoing Track 2 project- with aim to build a physical and virtual Innovation Hub in the capital of Bissau. We will try to integrate the solution clinic permanently in the virtual space.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Any NGO, CSO, or Government Instituation who would like to crowdsource ideas and discuss challenges in relation to development challenges.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, this was the second iteration and we will do a third in December 2022. In the second iteration we offered connection and devices to the solution holders inside the UN building as we in the first session experienced difficulties in this area. We changed some of the questions in the survey as we learned along the way that the session is purely about generating new perspectives and create a space for peer-to-peer feedback.Some of our initial questions focused on more traditional aspects of entrepreneurship such as access to finance. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Be open to this interesting methodology!

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, in any of the other SDGs as the solution holders are bringing solutions and challenges in relation to the 17 SDGs, in addition I beleive the methodology can be used to crowd source ideas around any challenging topic. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

As always, I would have liked to work closer, in deeper synergy with both the solution mapper and the explorer. 

> What surprised you?

The vibrating and deep discussions as well as the synergies brough by the methodology developed by the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt and the Responsible Leaders Network.
