> Title of the innovation

Aquaculture and Fish farming project

> Brief description of the innovation

The Innovation it's made up of youths in the field of Aquaculture in the Fisheries sector by producing fingerlings and consultation, trainings to farmers and hence creating jobs,  providing protein source to the community which is to be based in Mumbwa District and hence adding development to the district.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Innovation its like to generate income through selling fish seeds and table size fish, as well as from conducting fish farming trainings to the farmers as well as other crop and livestock farming trainings. The Innovation its able to provide jobs to the youths and those around the community also will increase on source of protein and act as source of income to many small households. As for market due to shortage of fish seed suppliers there is more chances of finding a better market without a struggle and easy to compete.  The targeted market will be farmers who wants to do grow outs and marketeers. With time value additions such as fish salting,  drying, smoking and making of other products like fish sausages will be conducted in order to fetch more market.

> Technical Feasibility

The Innovation its designed in a way that breeding ponds about 10 of 10m x 5m each will be constructed where breeding will be taking place as well as, nursery ponds, and a hatchery provided the funds are made available the project its likely to commence this season. The group is made up of members with experience in the same field avoiding try and error methods which can cause the business to collapse,  we also have in our group people who have done marketing for easy access in finding market.  There are some few ponds which has been set up but not working due to lack of plastics to put in.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The production of fish and fish seeds, will increase on the production which will give more room for farmers to venture into production hence this due to availability prices of commodities are likely to drop and giving opportunity for anyone to buy at low cost and so will the protein source be available to every home and reducing malnutrition.  As to the market fish seed supply it's very relevant coz there is shortage of supply. By producing quality seeds will ensure quality end product.
