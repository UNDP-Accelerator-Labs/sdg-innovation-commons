## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Through exercises under the Portfolio Sensemaking and acceleration protocol framework, programming units (Environment and Climate Change and Governance) were enabled to re-look and evaluate their current projects in line with the National Government's priority and UNDPs role and intent. This surfaced various assumptions/ reasons for choosing certain programs and gave insights on where some of these programs need to be changed to create more alignment within units and within larger UNDP.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF programming units understand the portfolio approach and systems thinking THEN they will create programs that are more aligned resulting in strong portfolios of projects that will compound results instead of disjointed standalone programs. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Evaluate portfolio strength and alignment pre sensemaking sessions. Introduce portfolio sensemaking frameworks and then test out changes in programming and strength of portfolios. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

UNDP programming units

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Qualitative data from the units and participatory observations 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

12 months 

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
