Problem: To obtain water, the villagers had to resort to the Naranjo River, 3 kilometers away; The time spent by women and children to carry water was four hours a day; For the washing of clothes, they had to move to the river and pay for transportation. Only two families in the village were supplied with water from artisanal wells. In addition to the weather, women put themselves at risk by leaving their homes too early to try to take advantage of the river's flow.

Solution: Formation of the COCODE as a tool to face the problem of water scarcity in the community and The community well is built, which has a system that supplies 465 jets for each house and 5 extra jets which are for communal use and are located in public areas.
