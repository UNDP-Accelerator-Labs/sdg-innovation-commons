Broiler rearing/keeping

> Brief description of the innovation

Broiler keeping has proved to be one of the most prominent business in Kabompo District. I have been in this business for some time now but capital has really been a problem. So sometimes I run out of chickens which is not good on the part of my business. So if I can be helped with a reasonable money I would love to employ other youths to help me run my business hence reducing on unemployment levels .
