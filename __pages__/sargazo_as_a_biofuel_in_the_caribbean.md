Department of Energy, Metropolitan Autonomous University


> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

Raymundo López Callejas (e-mail: rlc@azc.uam.mx)

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Yes, Department of Energy, Metropolitan Autonomous University

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Researchers of Mexico transform the sargazo in Mexican beaches in the Caribbean Sea to produce biofuel. The burning of this fuel would be used to heat water in order to obtain vapour for the hotel industry in the state of Quintana Roo.


> Please upload a picture of the solution.

Even though tha sargazo is considered a pest in Mexican beaches, this is a non-renewable biofuel that depends from the amount of sargazo that can be collected each season.
