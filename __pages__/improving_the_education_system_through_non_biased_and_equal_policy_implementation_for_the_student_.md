> Title of the innovation

Improving the education system through non biased and equal policy implementation for the student/pupil.

> Brief description of the innovation

Schools like any other sector in a country contributes vastly to economic growth. As an institution [Schools], I believe one of it's responsibility is to plant a seed in every child and grow a responsible and resourceful child. To achieve this certain policies need to be revised, renewed or introduced in order to sustain growth. An example would be introducing skill developing curriculum and building facilities that will enable those skills to be realized. A skill could be poultry farming, fish farming, crop farming e.t.c. Every child has potential to realize who they want to become, in addition,  I propose a transparent and reliable access to education for all. Equal distribution of digital devices, fully stocked libraries, engaging pupils in school activities, teacher parent associations, free and non biased or discriminating environment, school clubs like jets, music, sports clubs should be well funded and supervised in order to grow the next talents and many other policies that could bring sustainable development.

My innovation is designed to help grow a self sustaining mindset in a student/pupil. This could be achieved through education by introducing policies that are friendly yet effective in the education system. Revising policies that keep a student/pupil in class for longer hours/years and introducing policies that involve participation in skill development. Stages to include may involve building infrastructure for skill realization, collaborative venture capital from both the government and stakeholders.
