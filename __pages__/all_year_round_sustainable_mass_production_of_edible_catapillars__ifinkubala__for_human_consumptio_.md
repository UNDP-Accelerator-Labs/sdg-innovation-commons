> Brief description of the innovation

Insect farming is the practice of raising or breeding economically important insects for commercial purposes. The main aim of this innovation is to initialize the artificial mass rearing of edible caterpillar all year round in Zambia.  Mass rearing of Chipumi, Gynanisa maja, Strand, will be exploited in this innovation as it is on high demand and always fetches the highest price on the market. It is also suitable for infants, and for production of animal feed, as it lacks sharp spines that maybe dangerous to infants and animals. The innovation will include:
1.	Studying the biology and behavior of Chipumi in the laboratory under controlled conditions to determine the best conditions for its growth and mass production.  
2.	Studying the safety and nutritional value of the artificially grown Chipumi species.
3.	Studying the cost of mass rearing of Chipumi to evaluate its commercial viability. 
4.	Patenting and commercialization of the product. 
5.	Studying the best processing and marketing strategies for the product.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The demand for edible caterpillars in Zambia is always high and will continual to grow in the near future due to the rise in the country’s population, increased meat restrictions, obsession with health diet, and increased community awareness on the nutritional benefits of edible insects. Once the project is commercialized, the fully grown caterpillars will be sold to local traders, restaurants, supermarkets and industries that produce animal feed. The eggs, neonates and adult moths will be sold to small-scale insect farmers or commercial farmers who will be interested in setting up the same business. The remaining organic waste will be sold as bio-fertilizer or as feed to fish farmers. The money generated from all the sales will be used to scale-up the production, pay myself and my workers. Since, the production will be all year round, it means both, the workers and I, will have permanent jobs. The benefits of this innovation on the environment are as follows; (i) artificial production of edible caterpillars will cut down on deforestation which is encouraged by current conventional harvesting methods, (ii) insects produce less greenhouse gasses as compared to live stocks and (iii) they require less land and water. The challenge prize will provide the finances that are urgently need for initializing of this project.

> Technical Feasibility

In the pilot phase, the innovation will consist of an air-conditioned room provided with a humidifier to maintain a constant room humidity. Large trays to hold larvae (worms) and simple cages made with planks and nets to hold adult moths. Honey as natural diet for adult moths and leaves of the miombo tree, Julbernardia paniculata as natural diet for caterpillars. Thermometers to monitor the temperature of the room and disinfecting reagent to keep the room clean. There is a prototype in the School of Agricultural Sciences, at the University of Zambia, but it is used for mass rearing of Fall Armyworms for research studies, which I am part of.

> Anticipated Social Impact

a.	My innovation will reduce hunger and malnourishment that has ravaged our country, especially among women and children in rural areas, where access to meat is limited, as the produced edible caterpillars will be cheaper and available all year round. Edible caterpillars have a higher nutritional value than meat products produced from livestock.   
b.	My innovation will also allow production of sufficient edible caterpillars that would be used as relief foods during famine and catastrophic events.  
c.	It will also allow individuals and cooperatives with little financial capitals and small farm plots to set up small businesses and start earning money all year round. As it will not require huge capitals and larger farm plots.  
d.	Traders and marketers will not have to travel long distances, or change their businesses during and after seasons for caterpillars, as they will have consistent suppliers within their respective regions.  
e.	My innovation will provide permanent employment to a lot of people. It will also help the growth of other industries such as fish, and animal feed producing industries. As it will provide cheaper and consistent supply of essential raw material to these industries.

2)	How relevant is proposed innovation to the current market?
a.	The insect farming industry is a new generation of livestock production and it is predicated to grow at a rate of 27.8% by 2030. 
b.	The increase in the population of Zambia and that of the world has put pressure on the animal-based food proteins, thus, there is an urgent need to develop an alternative and sustainable sources of proteins. 
c.	Insects have many advantages over livestock, as they multiply faster, require less land and water, they emit lower greenhouse gasses and requires less financial capitals. 
d.	Globally, more than two billion people, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America, eat edible insects, thus, the market is already big and they are always on high demand.
