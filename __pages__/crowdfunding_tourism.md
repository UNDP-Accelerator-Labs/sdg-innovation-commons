Crowdfunding Campaign - Roots Reconnected
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that tourism locations along the Kwanza river require development and promotion, since there is an increasing interest from African American communities in visiting these historical sites. There is a need to mobilize resources in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The town of Massangano, in the province of Cuanza Norte, has great historical relevance for Angola. Located at the confluence of the Cuanza and Lucala rivers, it has potential for cultural and ecological tourism, connecting with pre-colonial heritage and the slave trade. The site includes historic monuments, and there are efforts to preserve and enhance the heritage, with the potential to make it a key tourist destination. Historical evidence reveals a direct connection between early African-American families and records of enslaved individuals who trace their origins to Angola. Massangano was an important departure point for those who were taken to the Americas. In 1619, the first Africans from Angola arrived on the shores of Hampton Roads. It is estimated that over 12 million Americans in the United States are of Angolan descent. The Tucker family is descended from the first Africans enslaved in North America. The William Tucker 1624 Society intends to continue collaborating with the Government of Angola in various areas. Promoting tourism with a focus on Afro-descendant culture in Angola can be a gateway to strengthening international cooperation and community development.
