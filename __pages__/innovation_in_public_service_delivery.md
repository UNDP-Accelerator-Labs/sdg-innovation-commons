## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Innovation in Public Service Delivery
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is minimal public service delivered through established institutions

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Over the years, Zanzibar has recorded improvements in macroeconomic management, improved wellbeing and access to social services, steady increase in tourism, contributing to attaining lower-middle income status in 2019.  The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (RGoZ) has also invested in creating institutions and systems aimed at strengthening the rule of law and instituting good governance in public institutions, as well as implementing reforms to improve delivery of services to the public. The reforms, notwithstanding, public service delivery and timely implementation of agreed priorities remains a challenge. Matching the high expectations of the Zanzibaris requires efficient, effective and responsive public institutions with capacity to accelerate delivery of high-quality services to its people. It is within this context that Zanzibar’s Development Vision 2050 and the Zanzibar Development Plan (ZADEP 2021-2025) place priority to improved public services in Zanzibar.   The Eighth Phase Government Administration in Zanzibar, led by H.E Dr Hussein Mwinyi, President of Zanzibar and Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, further underscores the importance of improved public services, good governance and capacity to implement national strategies and projects to achieve agreed national priorities within time. H.E. the President has therefore decided to establish the Presidential Delivery Bureau (PDB), to be housed at the President’s Office. The mandate of the PDB will be to co-ordinate and accelerate implementation of the government’s strategic priorities and delivery of results for social economic transformative impacts in Zanzibar.  The bureau to be managed by experts, will be responsible to support the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) execute their respective duties and ensure that plans, programmes and projects are implemented effectively and efficiently. The novelty of the institution and its concept, calls for supporting the RGoZ establish and operationalize the PDB. It also entails strengthening PDB’s capacities and capabilities to undertake its mandated roles and functions.  It is within this context, that UNDP is committed to collaborate with RGoZ and other partners, towards establishment and strengthening of the Presidential Delivery Bureau.

The president of Zanzibar has clearly  indicated that there is lack of real time data in Tracking and monitoring of public service delivery to its people. There is obviously also minimal processes that enhance learning as part of the implimentation strategies.

The RGoZ has consistently acknowledged the role of good governance in facilitating development in its previous national plans. The establishment of an accountable, transparent, responsive and effective system of governance that is resilient to developmental pressures cannot be emphasised enough. In this regard, Zanzibar has made headway in terms of creating legal and administrative frameworks promoting the rule of law, the protection of vulnerable groups and environmental management. However, plans have not always translated into action: reporting mechanisms are occasionally incomplete while enforcement of strong legal provisions is often a challenge. Moving forward, Zanzibar must ensure a clear, consistent and continuous link between policy and implementation. Overall, it is important to note that governance and resilience is not just a static event but a dynamic series of multifaceted and multidimensional processes, initiatives and institutions.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Delivery Bureau by design is lean, to be led by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) supported by highly skilled experts specialized in the relevant fields of the identified priority sectors. The Office of the President will lead the recruitment of CEO and other experts, on contractual basis according to the Public Service guidelines. UNDP will support remuneration of the CEO, as well as 3 Managers, including Blue Economy Delivery Manager, Tourism Delivery Manager and Financing and Resource Mobilization Specialist. UNDP will also second (from time to time) to the PDB a member of the UNDP Accelerator Lab Team, to support the PDB on innovation and digitisation processes

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can real time help improve public service delivery ?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The methods will aid in understanding changing behaviors, preferences, and pain points, as well as in focusing efforts in the right places and in the right ways. Designers can build solutions that work well and widely in our new reality by unlocking the user's perspective—whatever that ultimately looks like.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Government authorities in Zanzibar are currently using outdated data from long term studies/surveys and periodic field visits data. Using new sources of data will enhance policy and programme decisions in  Solid Waste Management.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Even though this challenge may be suitable for 5 year election term of the current government, we believe that lessons learnt from this process will enable th ecreation of strong use cases for subsequent presidents/governments
