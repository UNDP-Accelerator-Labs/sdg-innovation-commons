> Title of the innovation

Contribution to the production of affordable farm production and increased availability on the market .

> Brief description of the innovation

I have a small piece of land ,located in Kafubu farm block ,Ndola. 

My vision is to have multiple farming activities broken down  in the following processes .
1-Gardening of vegetables 
This will involve all kinds of vegetables . There is a high demand for English vegetables in local markets as well as super markets . The demand has always been there yet supply as been extrely low. This will help improve and maintain good health in our people and creat jobs. 
2-Goat and pig rareling .
Having to grown maize for both human and animal consumption will enable me produce meanie meal and animal feed to as cost reduction measure for the farm.  My farm will root just raise animals but also process into finished meat products .this will also mean affordable and accessible meat products in the area and job opportunities for the nearby communities .
3-Production of fruits and citrus fruits for both local and export markets.
4- Fish farming , I hope contribute the fish market 5 tonnes of fish on a month basis. This will increase the commodity on the market thereby reducing demand and lower growth the prices and in the end enabling all citizens to afford.
