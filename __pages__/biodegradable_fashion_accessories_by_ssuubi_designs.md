Empowering marginalized youths in skills of fashion through upcycling waste and using environmentally friendly materials.
The company was founded in 2014 by Josephine Nakiyimba from western Uganda. The name is derived from the Luganda term for “hope”. We use materials that are available everywhere – because we upcycle waste. Out of paper we make beads, and plastic bottles are turned into bracelets and earrings. Bark cloth, being a completely natural product, is blended with colorful Kitenge fabric to become a biodegradable wallet. Bark cloth is the first cloth humans ever made thousands of years ago from the bark of the Mutuba Tree, home only in Uganda.
