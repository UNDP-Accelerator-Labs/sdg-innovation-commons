## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



1. Man made hatchery can safeguard the eggs of vulnerable sea turtle.

2. Preservation of turtle eggs can increase the rate of hatching by 2 to 3 times.

3. Close observation of turtle behaviour mapping is effective to design the outcome.

4. Primary data casting helped us to compare the changes in number of turtles hatched with the secondary data.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



This experiment on turtle was a joint initiative of the Department of Environment (DoE) and UNDP. While it has been initially piloted at the Saint Martin's Island that is known as the heaven for many marine creatures for safe nesting. Ocean biodiversity was disrupted over the years for various manmade reasons. Considering the issue of biodiversity loss of the ocean environment, DoE and UNDP took the action in hand for protecting turtles' generation as they are the sweeper of the sea, and they had great contribution to preserve the biodiversity of the sea. Our combined conservation efforts started showing its' colour with the increase of number of eggs of the rare kind of Olive Ridley turtles recorded in previous years. Capturing the success of the safe hatching of turtle's egg, DoE is highly encouraged to scale up and expand the initiative at other small islands of Bangladesh like Kuakata, SonarChar, Sonadia island, Kutubdia, Shahpari, Cox's Bazar etc. Some other government entity namely Bangladesh Oceanographic Research Institute (BORI) is also carrying out similar types of activities for the sake of marine biodiversity and environmental protection. 

However, the government has initiated several actions to create a safe environment for the turtles, including setting up conservation centres in Cox's Bazar where eggs are incubated and hatched in a controlled environment to give the hatchlings a better chance of survival.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



There are no readily available data on the number of turtles coming to lay eggs on the beaches, their nature, birth cycle, hatching places and so on. So, with this above-mentioned data types we were trying to understand how many turtles are coming to lay eggs, how many turtles died because of not being able to lay eggs, how many turtles were injured and killed, what were the preferred locations to lay eggs, timing, and were any of the interventions taken previously to conserve turtles nesting. Some secondary sources of data helped to estimate the previous records of turtles coming to the beaches and their nature of nesting. Still there was need for primary data for which the team had to depend on the participatory observation, photo documentations, and collective behavioural approach.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



Using these above-mentioned methods, the team were able to explore the actionable programs and sustainable mechanism for protecting the inhabitation of sea turtles. As our frontier challenge was to protect the biodiversity of the oceanic environment, it was essential to know about the most significant component that can protect the biodiversity beforehand. To unpack the system,

Realizing the importance of sea turtle in marine biodiversity preservation, UNDP Bangladesh didn't make any delay to conserve and ensure the safe hatching of the vulnerable turtle at Saint Martin's Island. As the Department of Environment (DoE) has already been working on the protection on ocean biodiversity and environmental conservation, they were preserving the turtle's egg on trial basis. In this they allocated land for making hatchery near the office of DoE at Saint Martin's. With DoE's support, UNDP has provided technical assistance in collecting the turtle eggs by employing workers at Saint Martin's. Also, the team was observing the number of turtles coming to lay eggs on the beach, intervals and frequency of their coming, number of eggs they lay, proportion of the baby turtles hatched in comparison to the number of eggs kept for hatching.
