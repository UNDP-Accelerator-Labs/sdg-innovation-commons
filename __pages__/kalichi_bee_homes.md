> Title of the innovation

Kalichi Bee Homes

> Brief description of the innovation

We would like to build and install a new kind of easy to make Bee Home and place them in areas across Zambia. We are targeting 10,000 Bee Homes Doted around Zambia. These Bee Homes are a new innovation in that they are smaller than the common traditional Bee Hives but can carry more honey and wax and they have the added advantage of easy handling for harvest and installation. 
The locally made hives tend to have between 12 and 15 groves which form the honey combs where the honey is produced by the bees. Through experience and consultancy from AdComs Managing Director Mr Julius Mbewe we have realized that you can build a smaller Bee Home with 20 groves by which the honey combs can be made which can translate into more honey and wax for harvest. 
Moreover, rather than placing in trees or at heights that are not so easy to get to we can design Bee Homes that have stands so as to be placed on the ground but safe from water and other predators at ground level. This new feature of placing the Bee Homes on the ground also allows for easier access for harvesting and re-deployment purposes

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

There is growing demand for Honey in Zambia as well demand for markets out side Zambia. The impact of deforestation in both Zambia and abroad has led to climate change which has had a negative impact on the regional and global population of Honey Bees. This in turn has had a reduction effect on amounts of Honey available for purchase. This has increased the demand for Honey and Bee Wax. 
Additionally, most Honey Farmers are not able to produce honey or wax at the required volumes for it to be commercially viable. We would like to climb this hurdle by placing numerous Bee Homes in numerous locations doted around Zambia in order to ensure as many of the Bee Hives are occupied in the soonest possible time. We will be biased towards rural areas so that they too can be motivated to make Bee Hives, the produce of which we will purchase in order to further increase our volumes. AdComs is likely to have an export license to Europe and with this license we will partner with them in order for the m to meet their over sees demand. We will also explore new markets in Asia and South America as natural honey is in demand in those regions.

> Technical Feasibility

Adcoms has developed a new and easier to build Bee Hives that is convenient for use. Each Hive has 20 groves where the Honey Combs will form. At the beginning of each grove Bee Wax is applied in order to bait the bees for quicker occupancy of the Hive. The Hives are made from Timber that is easily available for purchase and fabrication is done under instruction by a trained carpenter. Due to the number of Bee Hives to be assembled we will hire additional carpenters so that the work is done as quickly and as smoothly as possible. Each Hive is fitted with stands so that they can be placed above ground level but safe from rain water and predators.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Anticipated Social Impact
50% of all Bee Hives assembled will be given to marginalized and economically disadvantaged individuals. These individuals will be vetted and those who show the most entrepreneurial promise will be empowered with Bee Hives. We will also encourage the making of Hives at household and community levels where these Bee Hives will be located. This is to foster empowerment, local economic growth as well increased volumes of Honey and Wax for sale both locally and abroad.
Together with providing the Bee Hives we will conduct training sessions for all potential Bee Keepers in the communities the Bee Hives will be collected. Trainings that focus on the care and management of Bees as well as harvest techniques and support. As Bee entrepreneurs are supported we are confident that some will be able to supply our needs as well create new and profitable linkages with other buyers.
This initiative is anchored on creating local entrepreneurs in the community who are able to sustain themselves over time with little effort and supervision.
