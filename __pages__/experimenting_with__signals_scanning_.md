**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Lazar Pop Ivanov


> On date (Day/Month/Year)

14/12/2023

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

These are the Civil Society Organizations, that have shared with our team, signals/ trends of change.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Inspired by the UNDP ‘Signals Spotlight’ report [a publication that highlights signals and trends that are perceived as emerging and relevant for development policies] we decided to experiment with the ‘signals scanning’ process, localize it, and reach out to twenty civil society organizations in North Macedonia, askingthem to note, any signals of changes and trends that they believe are important for the development of our country in the years ahead. We ensured that the organizations have different development areas ofinterest, including environment, resilience, governance, economy, innovation, data, and digitalization, and we only briefly explained to these organizations, that signals can come in different shapes and forms, but that their commonality is that they should indicate a change or support some formulation of a trend.


> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If out of the 20 CSOs that we reached out to, the majority responds with recording a signal/trend, we can pilot this method in a thematic area and see if this tool can be used as a continuous tool for the country office to conduct horizon scanning.


> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Localized the signals scanning form for our local context.
2. Selected the #CSOs that should take part in this experiment.

3. Prepared the information to the CSOs, and reached out to all of them.
4. Gave them a short time period to respond to the query, and analyzed their data.
5. Published the signals and trends that we received, as a blog-post.


> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

CSOs

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Digital form. Microsoft Form.


> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Two months, including the drafting of the blog-post.


> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, we received 17 signals/trends from CSOs and had the majority of CSOs participating in the experiment, and recording their signals of change.


> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Very easy and simple to follow. I would recommend offering the form in multiple local languages.


> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Two months.


> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

circa 100 dollars, and a time investment.


> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

 We have now completed a second experiment, this time with a thematic focus on: gender equality and empowerment of women, where we expanded the base of collaborators to include, not only CSOs, but also academics, practitioners, and experts in the area. We are going to publish the insights from the second experiment, sometime in January '24.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Many CSOs want the opportunity to present some of their recognized signals/trends through our office to the general public. That is something that surprised me, just how interested CSOs would be in participating in an activity like this one.


> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

One thing that we didn't do in the first experiment, but are doing now for the second one, is give them an option, to be featured with a name/organizational affiliation when the article is made public. This has made a difference in the interest of the participants.


> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

I think all country teams could benefit from this experimental activity, if they are interested in creating an engagement/knowledge sharing tool with the practitioners/cso's/academic sector in their community or


> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Institutions could develop signals scanning capacities, and use it as an engagement tool with the private and the civil sector.


> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, thematic versus general signals scanning processes are useful, I believe.


> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

1. Localize the signals scanning form for our local context.
2. Select the target audience that should take part in this experiment.

3. Reach out to the selected audience, and explain the experiment/exercise.

4. Gave them a short time period to respond to the query, and analyzed their data.
5. Publish the signals and trends you've received.


> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. SDG driven signals scanning[s] are a great idea.


> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

For this experiment, the sensing and exploring were done for us by the Global team orgnizing the Signals Scanning process, and the Signals Spotlight.
