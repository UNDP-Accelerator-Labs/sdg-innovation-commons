## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

A comprehensive sensemaking and behavioral insight initiative has been successfully conducted among the local tour guides and motorbike drivers in Kuakata, fostering an enhanced sense of self-awareness. This strategic effort aims at amplifying awareness among tourists, enlightening them on the crucial aspects of biodiversity conservation. By empowering local stakeholders with this knowledge, we pave the way for a collaborative approach that aligns with the broader goal of preserving the unique biodiversity in Kuakata. Large number of stakeholders are aware and agree about the challenges identified and priority action taken. Participatory context analysis and needs assessment found very effective to take priority actions. The participatory process also brought ownership and equal understanding for moving forward for the actions. The context analysis also made data available for participatory and analysis and for evidence based decision making. The context analysis report consists of the findings from small group discussions, focus group discussions (FGD), sensemaking workshops, and interviews with local stakeholders such as local government, tourist police, tourist service providers, NGOs, voluntary organizations, the local community, etc. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

At this stage, the initiative has not yet reached the phase of formal handover. Currently, we have successfully trained two key categories of stakeholders, with additional stakeholders in the pipeline. The context analysis study report has been shared with the government and local stakeholders and the priority challenges have been identified. After identifying the priority challenges, local stakeholders are being trained and building capacity according to their needs and in collaboration with Bangladesh Tourism Board. Following the completion of the ongoing sensemaking and capacity-building efforts, our plan with Tourism Ministry is to transition the initiative to the Destination Management Committee for Biodiversity. Comprising members from the local government, Bangladesh Tourism Board, local voluntary organizations and NGOs, this committee will undertake responsibility for the initiative's continued monitoring and further capacity-building, ensuring its sustained impact and success. We will take remote facilitation role with Bangladesh Tourism Board.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Prior to this initiative, our database lacked essential information on capacity building initiatives related to biodiversity conservation in Kuakata. By focusing on this initiative, we aimed to bridge a crucial gap in our understanding and approach to sustainable practices. The selected types of data allow us to capture the impact of our efforts in reaching tourists through local stakeholders, shedding light on the effectiveness of our strategies in enhancing biodiversity conservation in the unique context of Kuakata. This approach not only helps us fill a void in existing data but also provides a comprehensive view of the initiative's influence on local awareness and conservation practices.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The need assessment study was imperative for tackling our frontier challenge due to its inherent ability to provide a structured and dynamic approach to complex issues. The complexity of our challenge, particularly in biodiversity conservation in Kuakata, demanded a method that could navigate diverse stakeholders and intricate systems effectively.
The selected innovation method facilitated a systematic unpacking of the system by offering a structured framework for analysis. Its emphasis on stakeholder engagement and collaborative processes allowed us to comprehend the multifaceted dynamics at play in Kuakata. By breaking down the challenge into manageable components, the method enabled a more granular understanding of the interconnected elements within the system.
Moreover, the iterative nature of the innovation method provided opportunities for continuous learning and adaptation. This was crucial in the context of a dynamic environment like biodiversity conservation, where factors and influences are subject to change. The method allowed us to remain agile, adapting our strategies based on emerging insights and feedback from stakeholders.
