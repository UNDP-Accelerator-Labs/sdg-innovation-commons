Alternative to fenthion for the control of Quelea birds
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that quelea birds eat more than a third of the small grains produced in Zimbabwe and there is no sustainable way to control them. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The birds eat traditional grains and communities have to be in the fields chasing them all day leading to serious loss of productivity time. The chemical used to spray them is very toxic to non target species 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we control quelea birds at scale in a sustainable manner

Experimentation because this approach had never been done before 
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



This work will not only benefit Zimbabwe but SSA beacuse quelea are a threat to most farmers in SSA
