> Description of the solution

Google and the FAO have partnered to create a free, open-source tool called Collect Earth. This tool allows farmers to monitor their land over time using satellite imagery. By analyzing historical and current satellite images, farmers can identify changes in vegetation, water bodies, and land use. This information helps farmers make informed decisions about crop management, resource conservation, and responding to climate change.
