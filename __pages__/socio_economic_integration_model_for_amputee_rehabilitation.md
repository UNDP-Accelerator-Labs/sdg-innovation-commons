Socio-economic integration model for amputee rehabilitation

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to make an assessment of the needs of over 100,000 newly amputated people during 2023 earthquakes and develop a model for their rapid socio-economic integration to prevent long-term disabilities.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Individuals with disabilities are one of the groups, which are more vulnerable to the impacts of disasters. These groups face worse outcomes in terms of various psychological, economic and social aspects, ranging from the possibility of surviving the earthquake to the possibilities of accessing assistance after the earthquake. 
 
In addition to existing vulnerabilities, it is estimated that more than 200,000 people were injured during the rescue operations at February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in Türkiye, of which 60 percent is claimed to be amputated, who need special care for their socio-economic integration.

20 people with amputees will be selected from the earthquake affected region, depending on a set of criteria for sampling for the basis of a study, including the level of their medical status, economic background, educational and social background, age and gender. The group will be first evaluated based on their medical, prothesis and psycho-social support needs by a team of volunteer doctors.
The doctors will utilize EşrefPaşa Hospital, a hospital run by the İzmir Metropolitan University for the evaluations, and revision operation in future as needed for the installment of prothesis. 
 
The group will be taken to Dreams Academy in Urla for their rehabilitation, trainings for upskilling, and confidence development to break the barriers for their quick integration to social and economic lives. Dreams Academy curricula will be utilized, which has been UNDP’s flagship program for disabled persons for almost two decades. The outcome will be reported at an international Barrier Free City (Engelsiz Kent) Congress hosted by the Metropolitan Municipality of Izmir in early December 2023 and opened to discussion with the stakeholders and authorities. The model will be finalized after the workshops at the Congress by the end of December 2023. 
 
The strategy is based on a triple-E methodology (Evaluation, Empowerment, Engagement). The professional and technical competencies, as well as educational and vocational backgrounds of the individuals will be evaluated and included in a database. A pre-test and post-test will be conducted to evaluate their progress. At the end of the programme, a focus group discusssion will be organized to receive the feedback from the beneficiaries. 
 
Within the scope of “eyLAB” barrier-free living laboratory, people in need are provided with access to tools such as white sticks, glasses, walkers, artificial limbs, and wheelchairs. Trainings on general health information, first aid training, nutrition and well-being are a part of the organization. 

With the guidance of the evaluation experts, a mentor/buddy will be assigned to each person. In order to support the normalization process, the mentor/buddy conducts regular meetings with the individual. They support individuals about their lessons or professional life by phone, message, face-to-face and online meetings. 

At the end of the pilot application of the model, a final report will be prepared. The report will include two chapters, one on the recommendation for the medical treatment of the amputated people, and the second on the model for socio-economic integration of earthquake victim amputees, which is the basis of this study.
 
The chapter on medical treatment will be a collection of recommendations from the medicine practitioners, who will form a voluntary network to be prepared and engage in disaster situations in the future. While this activity is focused on the model for socio-economic integration, due to close relationship between the medical and psycho-social needs of the amputated people, a linkage with the work of the medicine practitioners will be made to provide support for the foundation of the volunteers network, connecting the target group of this study with the doctors for examination and evaluation, and facilitating a stakeholder dialogue with the authorities and relevant organizations and experts as an input to the final report. UNDP may provide additional support from the resources other than AccLab’s, and consider the medical aspect to be incorporated in the model for socio-economic integration in the future to be practiced/replicated in future phases, potentially starting with the Disabled and Elderly Centers built by UNDP in the earthquake affected region with the funding made available by Korean Government. 

The report will be drafted by the end of November to be presented at the Engelsizmir Kongresi (Barrier Free Izmir Congress) in December 2023. After the presentation of the draft report at the Congress, two workshops will be organized for medical needs and socio-economic integration with respective organizations. By the end of December, the report will be finalized by incorporating the inputs collected during the workshops. 


> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Official data is limited, but available at Ministry of Health, Ministry of Family and Social Policies and local governments of 11 provinces. There will be efforts to build a database of the victims and their special needs for medical treatment and psycho-social support, through the work of local networks.

The model will work with 20 selected earthquake victims, who will be selected based on a criteria set. After the exploration and experimantation period, the results will be shared with the authorities and other relevant organizations to raise awareness on the importance and urgency of this challenge and with which tools the challenge can be addressed.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Accelerator Lab will support the process for the development of a model reforming the Dreams Academy curricula, which has been UNDP’s flagship program for disabled persons for almost two decades, to address the early trauma issues and rapid treatment needs of ten-thousands of people, who were amputated during the earthquake rescue operations. The model will be developed through a participatory and voluntary engagement of medical practitioners, prothesis makers, psycho-social support teams, local and central governments and other experts. UNDP Türkiye aims to leverage the action in 2024 through a project, funded by Korean Government and potential others. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



The special and rapid needs of the earthquake victim amputated persons under trauma will be addressed through a socio-economic integration model to be developed by AccLab.
