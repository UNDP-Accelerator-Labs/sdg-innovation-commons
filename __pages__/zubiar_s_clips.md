> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

I did not originally 'map' this solution. I heard about it from a former colleague of mine Gordon Jackson, who works with local communities in Baa Atoll to change the way that they manage their waste. In the month of August he sent me a video of a staff of the Baa Dharavandhoo island waste management center (also known as Eco Centro for its focus on recycling and move towards zero waste), making clips from aluminum fans dumped at the center. Since I am not currently in the Maldives - I decided to use this opportunity to find out the story behind this solution which for me is very innovative and inspiring. So I spoke to Gordon, and with his permission and blessing - got in touch with Zubair to find out the story behind this innovation. Here is the story behind this local solution: Zubair joined the Dharavandhoo Eco Centro last December. By then they had started segregating and bundling recyclables (metal, aluminum and plastic) into neat bundles - which then could be transported to Thilafushi where the plastic is taken in by Parley and the aluminum and metal taken in by Secure Bag for recycling. These bundles are held together with bands which are kept together using metal clips. Gordon and his team at Soneva used to supply the Dharavandhoo Eco Centro with these clips. With the disruptions in supply chains, they were having difficulties in getting clips. Without the clips, the Eco Centro was going into disarray, with the waste piling up in an unorganized mess in the center. Distraught, Zubair decided to try and invent his own clip. But to do this, he took one of the few remaining imported clips and realized that it was a piece of metal with a few bends. He undid the bends to get the exact measurements of the entire piece. Then he looked for waste materials that he could use to make his own clips. What he found and used are "Usha" brand aluminum ceiling fans. They had plenty of that at the Eco Centro. At first, the process was rather rudimentary. He used a hand cutter to cut the fan, and then a hammer to bend. Now he is working on perfecting his own clip making machine (also made from various materials sourced from the waste management center) to make the process faster. Currently, he makes about 40 clips a day. He reckons that Dharavandhoo will not have to rely on imported clips anymore. He says that if he could speed up his process, he could even supply these clips to the rest of the atoll.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Upcycling/ Island Waste Management Solutions/ Circular Economy

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

When pushed, innovation is inevitable. You find solutions - where the problems are People innovate everyday to make their lives a little bit better - a little bit easier . Conveniences can sometimes kill innovation (?)
