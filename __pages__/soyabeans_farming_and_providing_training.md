> Brief description of the innovation

I grow soyabeans and also provide training to new and old soyabeans farmers on how become successful soyabeans farmers

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income after the sale of the harvest, formation of cooperatives, intensified on the training. Also the profit  will be used to purchase more land, seed and other farm inputs. The target market is as follows
1. Food Reserve Agency
2. Private Companies( essential commodities, Tiger feed and Mount Meru l
3. Exports etc All these buy soyabeans from farmers.
Soyabeans has less competition especially on issue of pricing because very few farmers do it successfully. Hence it is scarce on the market. So the crop dectects its own price. The value addition is the nutritional and healthy food that extracted from soyabeans. E.g. cook oil, milk, etc

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in such a way that enables easy implementation, that is clearing the fields, applying lime as early as September, then ploughing as soon as the rains start in November.
 The intended field to be cultivated is 20 Hactors, 80 X 50kg per hactor X 20 which is equal to 1600 bags. Farm equipment and human Labour has been put in place. Risk assessment has been done on using unqualified workers,they will receive strict and direct supervision. Incase of drought, the crop will be planted in Farrow's which will act as water reservoir. The budget is as follows
Soyabeans seed= 2000 kgs @ k44000
Lime.                    = 20 000kg @  k 2000
Fertilizer.              =  4000kgs @ k39180
Chemicals.          =  20ltrs        @ 15700
Labour.                 = 10 people @ 20000
Others.                 = Miscellaneous @ 15000
The whole project to be done in 3 months and September start and monthend of November

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the lives of people by way of adding nutritional value. The other reason is that people will be come financially independent. I run a Facebook group called soyabeans growers in  Zambia with about 62000 members. I have trained about 1500 both new and old farmers
