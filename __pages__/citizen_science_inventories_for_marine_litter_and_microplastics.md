> Please upload any supporting links

TBD

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

TBD
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

TBD

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

TBD

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Experiment design: 4 months Experiment execution: 2 months (6 days of testing over the time of 2 months) Scaling design: 3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

TBD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

TBD

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

This experiment has already been scaled into a national program with the Ministry of Environment (in 9 provinces and 2 indigenous territories). Scaling happened through a continuous scale design in collaboration with our academic and public sector partners, culminating in a weeklong training of regional directors (of coastal departments) of the Ministry. In this training, directors also went through a futures exercise which allowed for bottom-up planning of their

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

TBD

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

TBD

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

TBD

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

TBD

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

TBD

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

TBD
