> Title of the innovation

To creat energy efficient cooling system

> Brief description of the innovation

The system must freeze 100kg load within 5hrs from the normal 24hrs.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By freezing more product in a short period we can attend to more clients.

> Technical Feasibility

It will use a very low boing point refrigerant -Co2 ant high speed evap airflow. The supporting initial starting refrigerant will be R404 that will pull down to 0 degrees before tje Co2 picks up to drop down the temp to about -50.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By fast freezing product, most marketeers who deal in perishables will have where to store without worry.

> Name of the Innovator

Wilda

> Age

- 19-35
