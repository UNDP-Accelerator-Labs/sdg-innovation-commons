This is multipurpose system that has the full potential to change how the Zambian police works with or handles day to day information

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The system can be sold to the service,I can be offered a job or I and the service can reach an agreement where I host the system so I can continue to maintain,enhance and develop it more for this I might need a team and this mean employment to others out there,as at now the Zambia police at use paper base file system which is not as effective as it was in 1970,this system is a game changer

> Technical Feasibility

This system is designed to handle a number of task from taking both written and voice statements to analyzing crime development in the area,quick retrieval of information about an individual if he/she has an already existing criminal record in the country.this is more to this system I am willing to demonstrate if awarded the chance.
