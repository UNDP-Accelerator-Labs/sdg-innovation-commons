## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Within our learning question, we identified the following key problem areas that require further investigation in order to strengthen the MSME sector's resilience and growth opportunities through the use of e-commerce: We should develop new models of delivery that are both efficient and affordable. Increased operational capacity and efficiency of processes "beyond the basket" are required. One of the key priorities is to assist businesses in optimizing their business models and establishing online sales channels. Increasing awareness of the customer journey and experience is one of the key findings from this process's research activities. Finding new models for marketing partnerships is necessary to advance Serbian SMEs' local, regional, and international expansion. Additionally, it was determined that one of the critical follow-up activities that can address this listed issue should be our collaborative work on the Serbian eCommerce landscape with the Ministry of Telecommunications, Trade, and Tourism. Additionally, during the final months of this Learning cycle and in response to the frontier challenge, we supported an initiative aimed at developing a prototype for a startup portal that would serve as a one-stop-shop for all SMEs and startups in Serbia in collaboration with various stakeholders (Prime Minister office, Ministry of Economy, Digital Serbia Initative, etc). Our key insight from this engagement is that there is a genuine need among various stakeholders for a hub with all important information presented in a user-friendly manner. By requiring co-creation, we facilitated the process of developing a prototype using user-centric methodologies (design thinking) and established this approach as a recommended practice for our national partners' future efforts when planning the development of digital products and services.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Identified barriers in the area of eCommerce in Serbia: With progress, certain opportunities for further improvements are clearly visible, as well as room for further development. First of all, it refers to further development on the side of the economy, primarily in the MSME sector. Many businesses either do not use e-commerce at all or do not do it the right way. The main problem is the lack of awareness of the importance of e-commerce for one's own company, ie the lack of knowledge and available resources for the establishment and proper management of the online store. Elsewhere, there is still underdevelopment of users. There is a clear gap between the level of infrastructure development (access to computers, mobile phones, Internet), the use of other related services (e-banking, m-banking, payment cards) and the use of e-commerce. It is necessary to continue working continuously on approaching the benefits of e-commerce, as well as the correct ways to use it. For these reasons, education and capacity building on both the supply and demand sides stand out as the most important measures to encourage the growth of e-commerce in Serbia. Within all activities, it is important to continuously work on educating both citizens and the economy about the benefits of non-cash payments. Furthermore, it is important to work on the systematic improvement of the necessary  infrastructure for the development and growth of e-commerce, primarily in the field of finance and logistics. It is necessary to develop, encourage and promote new models of partnerships (primarily traders from the MSME segment with interested parts of the ecosystem from the private sector, such as electronic platforms, banks, technology providers, marketing agencies, etc.), as well as innovative models in logistics and delivery . Also, there is an opinion that the current regulations of the Republic of Serbia that have an impact on electronic commerce are not oriented in such a way as to prevent the development of electronic commerce. Moreover, the current regulations of the Republic of Serbia are such that they keep pace with the times and the growing need of traders and consumers to get involved in e-commerce. However, it is necessary to continue the systematic work of the state on creating a stimulating environment and improved business conditions in general, including in the field of e-commerce, primarily through optimization and digitalization, and simplification of administrative procedures related to e-commerce.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We needed to use a variety of data sources, both qualitative and quantitative, with the purpose of understanding and map the opportunity areas in order to build an eCommerce report as an entry point within the SMEs portfolio and to acknowledge the post-COVID eCommerce landscape.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

All of these methods and methodologies assisted us in deconstructing the problem we were confronted with and in identifying the gaps, demands, needs and expectations of SMEs and startups in Serbia (especially in the during and post-COVID times).
## Partners

The Digital Serbia Initiative, Nova Iskra, Belgrade Gets Digital, the Serbian Gaming Association, and the Serbian Blockchain Initiative all assisted us in bringing together all of the relevant actors in the private sector who have digital components in their businesses to participate in this exploration phase Returning Point organisation assisted us greatly in reaching our Serbian Diaspora and understanding their expectations perspectives Several organizations, including AFA (All for All, empowering women in business), the eCommerce Association of Serbia, and the Association of Young Entrepreneurs of Serbia, assisted us in better understanding the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Serbia (with a particular emphasis on the eCommerce area), on the basis of which we developed our work priorities.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The mix of methods, new partners and data helped us engage in questioning, observing, and associational thinking (connected seemingly unconnected ideas) together with storytelling
