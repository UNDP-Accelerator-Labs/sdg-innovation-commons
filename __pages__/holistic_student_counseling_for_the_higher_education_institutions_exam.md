Students (and their parents) cannot receive comprehensive guidance support during the preparation process for the university exam. With the aim of making students realize their potential; interests, occupations, departments/universities, learning behaviors etc. , it is aimed to carry out determination and planning interviews on issues, to improve their awareness and self-management skills.
