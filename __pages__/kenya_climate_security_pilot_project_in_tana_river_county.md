## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Kenya Climate Security pilot project in Tana River County
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there have been long-running resource-based conflicts in the Tana River delta, one of Kenya's most important wetlands that provides farmland and dry season pastures for the farmer and herder local communities, which has been exacerbated by the effects of climate change.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Tana River County is one of the six counties in the Coastal region. It has a total area of 38,862.2 square kilometres (the fifth largest in Kenya) with a population of 315,943 as per 2019 census and covers about 76 Kilometres of the coastal strip. The County gets its name from the longest river in Kenya (1000 kilometres long), River Tana, and has three Administrative sub-counties1 namely: Tana North (Bura), Tana River (Galole) and Tana Delta (Garsen). Non-arable land constitutes 96% and supports pastoralism as an economic activity. The rest, 4%, is arable land used for farming majorly crops for subsistence purposes. The County is largely inhabited by three communities, the farmers (Pokomo) and the pastoralists (Orma and Wardei). The Tana River Delta is one of Kenya’s most important wetlands providing farmland and dry season pastures for local communities. Climate change has played a role in the dynamics in the county, triggering various resource-based conflicts such as the Farmer-Herder conflict in 2013. Despite the County being endowed with enormous natural resources which can be tapped to create wealth for people, long running conflicts reported in the area continue to hinder development. Besides resource-based conflicts, political processes owing to the competition among the various ethnic groups to produce leadership is also a driver of conflict in the county.

The area has experienced insecurity, mostly as a result of banditry and conflict resulting from ethnic differences over control of natural resources between herder and farmer communities. Climate change has led to prolonged and frequent droughts accelerating the interconnectedness between climate change and conflict. In 2012, the county faced the worst tribal clashes that left 118 people dead and more than 13,500 displaced, over half of whom were children, women, and the elderly. Proximity to the infamous Boni forest also poses additional risk to increased violent extremism. The Human Development indicators reveal poverty level of 62.2% and illiteracy level of 67% in the county.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Kenya Climate Security Pilot Project (KCSPP) targeted Tana River County with a focus on sub-counties which have perennially been affected by cyclic episodes of drought, resource-based conflicts, floods and displacements. It is by now well-known that climate change is not just an environmental phenomenon but has implications for national and international peace and security. The pilot project was geared towards promoting integrated approaches to manage and reduce climate related security risks and strengthen the resilience of communities affected by the dual challenges of climate change and conflicts. UNDP Kenya, through the Accelerator Lab, partnered with the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) and the Tana River County Government on this project. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Kenya climate security project explored the role of place-based approaches and participants’ lived experience in reducing resource-based conflicts between herder-farmer communities. Through this, we created safe spaces for dialogue thus increasing social cohesion and reducing frequency of violence.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

If community level peace champions are accorded the right support, then they will sustain their peacebuilding operations beyond the pilot project. This learning question was borne from a series of design thinking bootcamps with peace committees and peace champions to develop creative solutions to empower those involved in promoting integrated approaches to manage and reduce climate-related security risks and strengthen community resilience. 168 individuals, comprising of women, men and PWDs, from 8 peace groups were involved in the co-design process.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Use of design thinking and human-centred design to dive deeper into the drivers of conflict using participatory approaches and build trust and collaboration among the communities. Use of ethnography to deeply immerse in the local communities in their environment to uncover deeper behavioural insights by learning about their lives, experiences, goals, desires, fears etc and using tools such as 'a day in the life' to map their lived realities. Use of collective intelligence to leverage mobility and location data to inform climate-resilient infrastructure in areas prone to disruptions caused by changing climate conditions.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Use of mobility data will help quantify peacebuilding and livelihood activities undertaken by the grassroots peace committees and provide evidence-based insights on firsthand experiences of communities at the frontlines of climate change.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Government agencies working on peace and security such as the National Cohesion and Integration Commission as well as internally at UNDP Kenya, through peacebuilding projects under the Governance portfolio
