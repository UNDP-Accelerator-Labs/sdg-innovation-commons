> Brief description of the innovation

Small Scale farmer producing Groundnuts, Pumpkins and other household farm products for home consumption and for sale need to realise the value of Cash crops through Value addition and market linkages. 
This project is a profit making venture that will help small scale farmers to improve food security and household financial security. 

In order to support small scale farmers who are mainly local women and youths who are unemployed in the rural parts of Zambia, Merchandising Sales Services Limited has developed a program to provide ready market for their farm produce. This program provides the ready market through value addition in the production of Peanut Butter and other peanut confectionery products, pumpkin Flour and pumpkin peanuts. The project is looking at increase product basket through increased product range.

However, the final products will then be supplied to the local retail stores in Zambia that includes, Shoprite Group with 41 stores nationwide, PnP Group with 23 stores, Choppies Group with 26 outlets national wide. These are organic products providing healthy dietary food supplements which are good for all the ages. Peanut Butter and Pumpkin flour will be the main products with additional confectionary products like snacks to complement the range.

The retail environment in Zambia is wide, we are look at 10,000 plus shops with opportunities to stock our products. We have be servicing some of the local markets in Lusaka, looking to cover the whole nation as we are failing to meet demand.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our Innovation is to empower small scale farmers in the production of Groundnuts and Pumpkins with ready Market. MSS Ltd is into Value addition, Sales, Market connect for small scale farmers who product for home consumption and to sale excess produce.

However, our program is to recruit small scale farmers in Area were they farmer Groundnuts MORE and Pumpkins. Once this is done smale scale farmers who are mainly house wife and youths in the rural parts of Zambia and have no access to the market. Our program will encourage farmers to venture in Cash crop which helps in improve house hold finances and food security. This gives them an opportunity to farm more so that they can sale to make more money. Our organisations is providing ready market which is guaranteed with competitive prices which gives a win win situation. 

To local business  we will supply cheaper and affordable value additional products that targets the mass market. Zambia's population has 70% middle income population with average life style conscious of their healthy. We are going to produce healthy and affordable products that will cater for all sectors of life. With access to locally produced raw materials the final product will be affordable for all. We have seen imported products that are expensive and caters for the rich or urban population. 

However, we are going to work with Minimum GP between 15 to 24% which allows all the player within the value chain to add a reasonable profit margin which impacts on the final shelf price. The market is huge which includes Intemba's, Grocery stores, Mini Marts, wholesalers and the Chain Stores. This gives us a great opportunity for the farmer to produce more in order to meet the market demand of value additional products.

The farmers makes profit and the manufacture i.e MSS Ltd becomes a major supplier of Peanut Butter, Peanut confectionery, Pumpkins flour, dried pumpkin leaves and pumpkin seed snacks which are healthy for men.
The program  will provide conservative methods of farming organic crops. More money in the farmers pocket, increased house hold food security and increase household income for the farmer.

The first 2 years will concentrate on these two farm produce and include other farm produce as we good to increase our product range to Cashew nuts, rice and Pasta. With good practice, this will protect the environment and help improve soil fertility.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation involves locally produced peanut butter making machinery which is used friend and gives quality products. Which are currently producing peanut butter spread, pounded Groundnuts and peanuts snacks. 

Currently we are buying raw materials from Central province and the rural parts of eastern province. This affects our price because there is no uniform price. Our production is ongoing at a small scale but our implementation plan to which is looking at mass production is planned for October with increased production and April 2022 during harvest period so that we can buy raw materials when they are reasonably cheaper. Once we buy raw materials in bulk to take us through to the next harvest season. This will increase our profits by 50% from every tonnage milled. Also we need to secure more Pumpkins during harvest period so that we can preserve more for dry season in order to have continuous and consistency production. 

Second season, we recruit more small scale farmers to increase their farm production in order to make more money and increase yield through good farm practice. This will be done during the period 2022 and 2023 season. Then the raw material availability will have been secured and consistency price point will have been achieved because we will be buying raw materials from recruited women cooperatives. 

Organisation grow plan and strategic sales plans will be our roadmap from the word goal. This growth plan is looking at new equipment and secure better production facilities that meets the ISO standardisation for all organisation by 2022 December.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our project is locally initiated to operate with the rural parts of Zambia with difficulties in accessing the urban markets 

Groundnut, Honey and Pumpkin production is mainly a woman venture when plants ground for home consumption as a snack and as relish supplement through pounded nuts. Groundnuts also a used as a nutritional supplement for children porridge and relish in place of cooking oil. 

Once these small scale farmers who are mainly woman and youths get more involved in improved farming, thus will help them increase household food security, household income and disposable guaranteed income to support there families.

The projects is more on the value addition program looking to work with the rural populous by providing ready market. We are going to buy all the targeted farm produce at a better price and the farmer will not travel long distance to access this market. We are going to open satellite depots which are going to be our buying point and warehousing within the communities. This will give a cash on delivery basis operation, meaning the farmer need to to travel long distance to get their money but deliver within the area and get paid upon delivery. 

This improves household financial and food security which gives local communities with money in securation and encourages other local small holder farmers to produce even more.

This partnership is going to to based on mutual understanding and mutual benefit the gives a sense of security and growth.
