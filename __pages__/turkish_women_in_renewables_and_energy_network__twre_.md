## 

With the women's network that TWRE has started to bring gender equality and inclusion to the male-dominated energy sector, it is aimed to create a positive perception towards women in the sector, to increase the interest of women in the energy sector and to bring more green-collar female professionals to the sector. Result-oriented lobbying activities and projects are produced to contribute to gender equality in social and business life, to empower and employ women.
