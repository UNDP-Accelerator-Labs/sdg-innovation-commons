> Title of the innovation

Poultry Production

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is about Poultry farming. The kuroiler and Sasso breed to be specific, these two breeds of chicken came about as an alternative for Broilers which are seen to be more expensive to manage. With this alternative the chickens can be raised like ordinary village chickens in the backyard or like the broilers. From experience i have noted that the chickens are more resistant to disease and are good for meat and egg production.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I am currently in my last year of Secondary school education. And i strongly believe that Poultry farming is a great engine for wealth creation in Africa. My innvoation if done on a larger scale can lead to education of youths and woman in the environment. Which would equip them with skills to manage their on poultries and create sources of income.this project will not only benefit me but the whole community as they will have a local supply of poultry products at offordable prices. The target market would be the community and market place. Where chickens can be sold in small quantities and in bulk.
The challenge prize would help by cutting costs as the business would purchase a hatching machine for the eggs and discard purchasing of chicks. The other plan would be to acquire land in order to implement the project on a larger scale as it is currently being ran in the backyard.

> Technical Feasibility

Due to lack of funds the products will be sold in the community to potential customers and Marketeers. But with support a vehicle would be purchased with a view to reduce on transporting expenses of the business as the goods needed for prouctiona are located in the city whilst the innovation is being ran in the outskirts of the city. With supprts the business can be ran more efficiently.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the lives of many as i was taught by senior members of the community and would like to teach my fellow youths the great skills of poultry managment. As it would not only be a 
 potential source of income for those who get involved but also a recreational activity for youth in the environment. 
The innovation is extremely important to the current market as entrepreneurs are beginning to withdraw from poultry farming because of failure to manage the products and expenses. And i believe the need for youths in agricultural activities in africa is rising hence this could benefit the whole continent in the long run.
