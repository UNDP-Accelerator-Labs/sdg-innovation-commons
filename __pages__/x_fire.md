Our solution is a distance limitless fire accident notification technology development called x-fire. It can sense fire accident early and able to make a phone call based accident notification to owner if they are anywhere located using internet. X-fire also able to notify fire accident agency and neighbours at its early stage of the accident. 
The technology that we have invented X-fire is the most efficient and affordable fire alarm compared to all existing ones. We have planned to sell each X-fire by 2,700 ETB but the existing ones are selling up to 4,500 ETB on the market. We have been checking the market in detail. So, there is a 1,800 ETB difference between our product (X-fire) and post products (fire Alarms).
