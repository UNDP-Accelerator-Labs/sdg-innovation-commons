> Title of the innovation

A world fullfilled food basket- woman in business

> Brief description of the innovation

his innovation is focused on the empowerment of women in rural to urban areas by setting up groups or cooperatives in cultivating a variety of crops such as soya beans, sunflower and mgv4 groundnuts which has the highest content of oil, Purchasing of the oil expeller for the dear purpose of producing cooking oil then sell in the market. The women must be learn to produce cooking oil which is cholesterol free and also step up to generate income to feed and educate the families in rural to urban areas. The model will be tailored in a way that 150 subscribed members in fee or having land or farm plots will be given a task after training to grow one these crops and there after the first harvest give a certain percentage of the produce to the group which will be used to form more groups((out grower schemes) in order to increase the capacity for the project to consistently produce oil when it commences and later on will in turn sell to the group as part of the membership incentive. And when the project succeeds within two years there after increase the membership by spreading up the organization in inviting women from urban areas .

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The stream of income from this innovation for me and others will be generated from the following 
1. profits of the sell of cooking oil -dividends and wages given to the staff/employees.
2.Supply of raw materials to the project by these women farmers will generate income
3.The community will also benefit by provision of raw materials when the innovation reaches extensive levels.
This innovation will also improve the operation of other business like business who we will enter into agreements with to do the branding, the company that does the production of the containers for our packaging these will have a stake from the purchases we will make from them and have more income anticipating that, has the demand increases it will create more jobs in that institution,
As we improve on our quality and packaging we anticipate to scale up from the walking sales to our project and the stores in the market, to supply to chain stores off course taking into account that offtake agreements are revealed in phases or periodically in order to deal with price changes and break even point, Price challenges can help the business grow by setting up price margin way safer beyond the projected inflation rate changes over a period

Nevertheless also providing feeds for the domestic animals in the community from the cake.

> Technical Feasibility

The oil crop and oil business is simply designed in the following
Staff 
Project Manager,Book Keeper,Agriculture assistant,store keeper,general workers
1.For a startup before going anywhere else is the establishing of subscribed 150 members of  women in Kipemba Solwezi were the majority of the families cultivate mgv4 groundnuts  also find a potential secure place for the factory and arrange for the acquisition of the machine while waiting for the set up of the machine
2.Venture into training through a qualified consultant 
on the cultivation of oil producing crops, preferential advantage for their cholesterol free content and how to expel oil from the raw materials
Market Research Training
Business plan training
3.After training then into the practical field demo planting and production of the crop coupled with them cultivating from the land portions
4.While awaiting harvest we run the installation of the Oil expeller on the found required electrical phase building and purchase of the containers and branding.
5.Test process of the cooking oil and invitation of the bureau of standards for quality check and certification then commence the sell of the oil to the community around  after certification .
6.As capacity grows in the given time frame then push to supply in chain stores which can increase jobs on the community

> Anticipated Social Impact

the relevance of this innovation to the lives in the community is that it provides women with agriculture education on the best practices of cultivating  such crops there also promoting community ones to stir up the all place production and business livelihood.
The oil processing project will become an income generating source for the produce or raw materials supplied to the factory by these women which in turn supports the families as is known in Zambia that the majority of women in homes are the ones who responsibly with love want families to be well fed and Educated as this walks in tandem with current government policy on not keeping our intellect at homes sponsor these in schools but off course which can be achieved by the generation of income from the oil factory.
The majority of people in rural areas keep local chickens,pigs,cows and other domesticated animals of which the factory's by product the cake can be sold to them and fed to the animals for healthy growth and multiplicative production thereby creating a variety of income generating activities as a result of increased healthy animal production.
The demand for oil cooking has gone high which has led to cartel ling of prices because of the few cooking oil producing companies that bring the product into the local market,now considering the fact that  this will be a local product it will become affordable to the locals or accessibly cheaper than the imported oils on the market. the product will also be sold on the pretext of it not being a health hazard as it is cholesterol free
