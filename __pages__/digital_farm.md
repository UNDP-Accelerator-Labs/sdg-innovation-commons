> Description of the solution

Digital Farm is an innovative and unique facility with the goal of supporting the digital transformation of agriculture in Serbia, the region, and Europe. It comprises a physical part and a virtual part.
In the physical part, various AgTech solutions like sensors, satellite images, drones, agrorobots, variable rate technology machinery, etc., are set up in the real agricultural production environment at the fields of Krivaja d.o.o. near Baƒçka Topola in Serbia.
The virtual part is the digital platform AgroSense. By using the data collected from satellites, drones, robots, different sensors, and meteorological stations, AgroSense allows for the monitoring of crop conditions and the planning of agricultural activities via mobile phones or computers.
