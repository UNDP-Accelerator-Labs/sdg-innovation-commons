> Title of the innovation

Under five vaccinetion and immunisation management system

> Brief description of the innovation

This system will help to keep track and reduce on use of papers on underfive card. It will also help parents to reduce on baden of caring cards wherever they go instead then just have to use the NRC number of the parents to track or see the child record.
This system will be centralized and can be accessed at any health center or facility. Looking at the system in use,it's difficult to come up with accurate reports due to the fact that the reports are done manually . The innovation to come since it will be computer based ,the reports will be very accurate and easy to generate because no one record will be getting lost. It will also reduce on government expense on printing underfive cards instead the system will be just developed and then deploy once and for all.
Last but not the least ,the child record will be accurate from day one upto five years.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Once under-five vaccinetion and immunisation management system (UVIMs) is done it will reduce on government spendings on printing underfive cards for children all over the country instead that money will be used somewhere else where development is needed.
The existing system it been manual ,it takes time to work with it ,with the UVIMS since it's computerized work will be easier and accurate, efficient and on point. It will alse reduce work overload on the health personal. 
The existing system take up alot of physical storage space which reduces the space for other activities to take place now . With the UVIMS, the physical storage or space is not needed since it's will be computerized so more space will be provided for other activities to take place, eg more offices will be created.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed to be an computer based system . This system will be centered meaning it will be centralized and it will be connected to health centers in order to communicate and collect data from all around the country and keep them on the center which will make it able to collect information from whichever health center the parents have gone to.

> Anticipated Social Impact

UVIMs will improve lives of mother's and children under the age of five and this is very relevant looking at the pressure and stress health personal are going through with the manual system.
The coming of UVIMs will improve lives for sure.
