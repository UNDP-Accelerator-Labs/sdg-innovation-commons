> Title of the innovation

iWay Energy

> Brief description of the innovation

iWay Energy, is a project that is designed to generate electricity at a higher voltage, country wide with the use of renewable resources. The main role of the project is to mitigate global warming, deforestation, climate change as well as air pollution. The projects main goal is bring an end to loadshedding by the use of highly advanceded techniques in the process. 
Once the electricity is generated we can therefore sale to companies like CEC(Copperbelt Energy), big industries such as the mines, agriculture sector. etc., as well as ZESCO.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The iway Energy project, is an innovation that is capable of accumulating huge sums of money through the selling of electricity to neighboring countries, commercial companies, CEC, ZESCO and to the local Zambians. Not only will the innovation generate income but it will also create abundant jobs to the Zambian Engineers, technicians and many more. iWay Energy, will tackle the issue of loadshedding, power deficit in Zambia, global warming, pollution &amp; climate change. 

Mitigation of all sorts of pollution as we climate change are the main value addition of the project.

> Technical Feasibility

iWay Energy is simply making use the three principles of velocity, acceleration &amp; friction to generate electricity. iWay Energy innovation was innovated in order to tackle the power deficit challenges in Zambia and mitigate deforestation which is now rampant in our country and to mitigate climate change.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will create abundant jobs to the locals, it will create a healthier environment by resorting to the use of iWay Energy as the source of electricity and avoiding the use of other electricity sources that may cause harm or pollute the environment both indirectly and directly. 

Electricity the key driver of the economy, it is at a higher demand, so it is very 100% possible that the iway Energy innovation will create huge sums for the country and stabilize the economy, this can be done by exporting to neighboring countries.
