> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

"Pachamanka". Over 500 years ago, indigenous peoples discovered that cooking inside the earth, with volcanic heated stones was much faster than cooking in pots. The technique consists in digging a hole in the earth, placing a bed of volcanic rocks, heating them with wood and placing food (meat wrapped in cabbage leaves, potatoes and other tubercules). Then, putting some water to create steam and covering the hole with cloths and earth again. Slow cooking to feed up to 200 people. The practice not only is eco-efficient, but a ritual to connect with earth and for community organizing as it is a collaborative practice.
