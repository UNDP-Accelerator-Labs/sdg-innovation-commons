## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Systemic and complex mapping of the Green Economy in Belarus
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to build a general view on the Green Economy as a system with the main stakeholders and actors from the various and unexpected sectors, define links and lack thereof, identify systemic issues, address systemic issues with key stakeholders and socialize the map with the key players.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The history behind the challenge is that UNDP and the AccLab is heavily engaged in the preparation of the Second National Action Plan on the Green Economy. During this work, one of the issues which has emerged  is a lack of cooperation between government actors and actors from other sectors. Ministry of Natural Resources and Academy of Science asked the AccLab to support in elaboration of the systemic vision of future of the Green Economy in Belarus. There are also other identified issues which might be a key for development of the Green Economy which are insufficient green jobs, low support for business which want to pursue a green agenda, Circular Economy as part of the Green Economy has low priority on the state level.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

There are various types of signals. The most salient amongst them are a buy-in from the national partners on developing the Green Economy; climate change is the emergency again; readiness of local authorities to support businesses with a focus on the GE; the GE is considered to be an opportunity for women's economic empowerment by the local authorities. The weak signals are interest from the RCO on the green growth, donors such as the UK Embassy, and the private sectors representatives are enquiring the AccLab on what can be done to strengthen their capacities in shifting to doing business in a green new way.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

One of the UNDP CO strategic goals is to pursue portfolio approach, which goes beyond the programmatic units approach, within the Green Economy theme. The AccLab is seen as binding force here which by not belonging to any programmatic unit can be a neutral side in pursuing the Green Economy agenda on the CO level and beyond. The same impartiality covers also interactions with various actors which in other circumstances would be difficult to bring together. On top of that, the AccLab team has various skills in various areas which can bring additional layers on how the Green Economy can be developed. For example, the AccLab adds to the discussions on the Green Economy a more specific focus on its inclusiveness, gendered focus, and digitalization and elaborating additional IT products. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The UNDP AccLab in Belarus works on the Green Economy for bringing various stakeholders together and making it smart, inclusive, and digital.
