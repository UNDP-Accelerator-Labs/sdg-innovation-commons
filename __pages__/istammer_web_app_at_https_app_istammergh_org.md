## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Stammering or stuttering is a type of speech impairment in which Persons Who Stammer (PWS) have significant problems with the fluency and flow of their speech. Typically, this manifests in repetition or prolonging of entire words or elements of words. Stammering can have negative impacts on the self-esteem of PWS and their interactions with others.  The use of speech and language therapy has been shown to be beneficial for PWS.  In Ghana, the Ghana Stammering Association (GSA) was set up to meet the needs of PWS including advocating for their rights.  Over recent years, the GSA has become increasingly aware of the significant difficulties PWS and people with other speech impairments, face in accessing therapy from professional Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs), due to cost, time and distance.    One way to address these difficulties is through a digital platform which connects PWS to professionals, so that for example a PWS in Tamale (in Ghana’s Northern Region) does not need to travel 6-8 hours to see an SLT in the capital city Accra.  Through collaboration with the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Ghana, this platform, known as the IStammer Web App (https://app.istammergh.org/ ) has now been launched and is being used to provide telehealth services for PWS, enabling them to receive counselling and speech therapy remotely.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If Persons Who Stammer (PWS), particularly outside the big cities like Accra, are provided with digital access to Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) through a web-app, they are more likely to take up opportunities to have speech and language therapy, and so improve their fluency of speech and levels of confidence,

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Work with the Ghana Stammering Association to conduct interviews and focus-groups with PWS, SLTs and policy makers to understand the value of speech and language therapy, and challenges faced by PWS in accessing SLTs because of financial and time constraints.  2. Engage an IT consultant to design the app, through co-creation with Ghana Stammering Association, SLTs and UNDP.  3. Testing of the app with 20 PWS and SLT pairs, with free therapy provided through UNDP.  4. Use web app data, interviews and focus groups to inform refinement of the app.  5. Launch of the app.  7. Roll-out and monitoring

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Persons Who Stammer (PWS)

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Analysis of customer journey data from the web-app (e.g., which pages were accessed, how much time spent on each page, routing errors) as well as interviews and focus groups with PWS, SLTs and policy makers.  Some of this data is being incorporated into a video documentary.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

9 months from collection of user requirements, design, testing and launch of the web app.

- 10-49

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

About 25% of Experimentation time.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven - https://app.istammergh.org/ and video documentary will shortly provide further feedback including from the stammering community and policy makers.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

No observations

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

9 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

5000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Next stage is to work with the private sector to support development of a mobile app and expand the focus of the app beyond PWS to persons with a spectrum of speech and language disorders. Also explore how to make the app financially self-sustaining.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

As above - currently in discussion with potential private sector partners.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

While digital solutions may be useful in enabling PWS to accept different services, a significant part of the challenge is the negative attitudes in some communities, which particularly affects children and the youth. There is an opportunity for the digital platform to be used as part of awareness raising and advocacy, not only to support therapy sessions.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Some stigma around stammering in sections of society.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Programmes aimed at supporting PWDs including the Inclusive Development Cluster in the Ghana Country Office. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Organisations such as the Ghana Health Service who are leading on the provision of telemedicine/telehealth services. Those delivering speech and language therapy, not only for PWS, but for other conditions which may lead to deterioration in speech, e.g. patients who are re-covering from a stroke, or persons with autism.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Iterations to simplify the booking system.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

To ensure that the voices of PWS at the grassroots level are fully incorporated into the design and conduct of the experiment. To understand that the topic can be a sensitive one for some communities and families, and hence may require social and cultural awareness and tact.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this is an example of the wider telemedicine/telehealth agenda, by providing access to health advice and support particularly for remote and under-served communities. However, although Ghana has relatively high mobile penetration, access to the right digital technology/infrastructure remains a problem for some communities. Data/broadband is also expensive - for everyone.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The idea for the app emerged from the UNDP Ghana Accelerator Lab Covid-19 Innovation Challenge, which was designed to explore innovative responses to Covid-19, map solutions, and test them. Hence the sense and explore phases of the learning cycle informed the design of the experiment. The Solutions Mapper and Explorer were fully involved in the design of the innovation challenge, mapping of solutions, and selection of solutions for experimentation. 

> What surprised you?

Discriminatory attitudes towards PWDs in some communities and the use of insensitive language.
