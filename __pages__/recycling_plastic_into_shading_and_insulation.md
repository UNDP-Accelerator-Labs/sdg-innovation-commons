Recyclable

> Description of the solution

Discarded plastic packaging can be recycled into sheets and insulation boards. These provide shading, reflect solar radiation and insulate dwellings from heat. CBalance also takes used plastic bottles and turns them into heat-control systems. The bottles are filled with water, sealed and secured to a roof. There, they absorb the heat from the sun and increase the roof‚Äôs thermal mass (ability of a material to absorb, store and release heat). This lowers the rate at which heat enters the building below. Overnight, the water in the bottles cools down, and next morning the process restarts.
