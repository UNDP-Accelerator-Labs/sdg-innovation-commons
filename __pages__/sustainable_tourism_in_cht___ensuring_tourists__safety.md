Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT region. One of the challenges to this end is that tourists are often unaware of and unprepared for the physical rigor of exploring the CHT, which can lead to them being demotivated or worse, injured. To address this, the tourists should be trained so that they are aware of the physical rigor of the venture they are embarking on and associated risks, including topics such as basic first aid, height they will be climbing, ways they can build a small bridge using locally available resources and ways to manage risks in different weather conditions. The picture shows a pilot first aid training organized by the accelerator lab in collaboration with the tour operators association of Bangladesh.
