## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

There are certainly very positive findings indicating that active participation of target groups in evidence-based energy audits with high visual components are more effective not only in creating awareness but also in triggering behavioral change and action for energy efficiency. 

Participatory walk-through heat audits effectively increased awareness of households on residential energy efficiency. As a result of the on-the-spot post-audit survey, 99.5% of participants declared that the audit increased their awareness on energy efficiency at varying levels. 

On the other hand, there has been a historical knowledge-action gap in households regarding energy efficiency. Households are mostly aware of benefits of energy efficiency investments but are inactive in turning their knowledge into investments. 

MoENR’s study in 2021 put forward an average 55.3% knowledge-action ratio in households for heating/cooling efficiency based on passive awareness raising methods such as brochures, video spots, social media posts etc. 

Participatory awareness raising method this experiment employed through handheld thermal cameras for walk-through heat audits at households resulted in 78% knowledge-action ratio in heat efficiency. This means that 78% of the participating households reported that they either planned or already invested thanks to our walk-through audits and recommendations on the spot.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Participatory, hands-on awareness raising methods have not been applied in homes. Rather, such applications are available at the sample energy efficient home model exhibited in Ministry campuses or other institutions or only by virtue of hiring a professional energy audit expert. Thus, data regarding effectiveness of hands-on awareness raising tools on household behaviour based on their socio-economic profiles are missing.
