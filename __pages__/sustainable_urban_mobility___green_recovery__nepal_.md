## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Making use of digital technologies to promote sustainable Urban mobility and Green recovery in Kathmandu (and beyond). 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that air pollution and other environmental issues such as waste management is increasing in Kathmandu valley and elsewhere in Nepal and there is a need of behavioral change among the citizens. Our 'learning intent' is to understand about the potential ways to incentivize citizens through the use of digital tools to perform activities that would possibly help in mitigating these environmental issues by adopting a range of environmentally friendly practices such as using electric public transport, walking, cycling, and upcycling of wastes among others. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

a. The Historical trends:  The death rate from both indoor and outdoor air pollutants was 133.3 per 100,000 populations (2017) which is the second-highest death rate after due to Cardiovascular diseases in Nepal. There is no complete combust when coal and biomass fuels are burned. (D, Peter. et al, 2019). 42,100 deaths in Nepal were attributed to air pollution in 2019. Of the total air pollution-related deaths that year, PM2.5 pollution was responsible for 17,900 deaths (State of Global Air, October 2020). A glimmer of hope was when Nepal went into lockdown, and in around April 2020, the residents of Kathmandu valley could get to see Mt. Everest as well from their homes, as the Kathmandu’s air pollution cleared drastically (Dixit, A., November 2020, Climate for Change). If we see historical data, a study done in 1998 shows that at that time, the transport sector contributed to the the largest share of pollutants, followed by the household and industrial sectors. Gasoline, fuelwood and coal were the dominant fuel contributors to total emissions and CO was the dominant pollutant (Shrestha, R. and Malla, S).   b. The causes and the drivers:  According to the Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), an NGO working in clean and renewable energy, a recent Kathmandu University study has shown that hundreds of lives can be saved only if we improve the transport sector and make it more managed and clean. With a better transport sector plan supported with interventions to cut down the vehicular exhaust and introduction of environment-friendly transportation facilities, 3,091 to 15,722 deaths due to air pollution can be averted in different scenarios. Such estimation on the reduced number of deaths due to polluted air was calculated using the WHO modelling tool called Integrated Sustainable Transport Carbon-Health Economic Assessment Tool for assessing vehicle emission and health impacts under different scenarios. (Mandal C., December, 2020).  c. The ones who are involved:  The World Bank reported that the mean annual ambient PM2.5 concentration in Nepal was 46.09 μg/m3 in 2013, and the PM2.5 concentration in Kathmandu in 2013 was 49 μg/m3 (WB/IHME 2016; WHO 2016). A more recent study shows that the daily mean PM2.5 and BC concentrations in Kathmandu valley, due to the transport sector, can reach 124.76 μg/m3 and 16.74 μg/m3, respectively, during spring (Shakya et al. 2016).  However, there are other entities that are involved as well. We cannot undermine the fact that Nepal lies in between the two big giant polluters in the world, India and China. Also, natural and man-made disasters, such as wild fires.  d. The current situation:  Apart from the above, of the current situation is assessed, the new issue of forest wild fires has brought air pollution to the most pressing issue now then more than ever. Last Sunday (4th of April) at 3:45 pm Nepali time, Nepal was the second most polluted city in the world with Air Quality Index (AQI) readings of 281, which is of ‘very unhealthy’ quality. Kathmandu’s AQI level has remained between ‘very unhealthy’ and ‘hazardous’ levels since then (IQAir, April 6, 2020).   e. The undesired effects:  Acknowledging the fact that COVID-19 disease is a respiratory disease, where 5-7% of the Nepalese residents are still becoming positive on a daily basis, toppled with the increasing pollution levels in the capital city and elsewhere, the health of the Nepalese citizens seem to be at high risk and there is need to behavioral change interventions at individual levels and policy reforms at local, provincial and national levels regarding adopting environmental friendly practices to bring decrement in the air pollution levels. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

According to a study by the Department of Environment in 2017, the transport sector contributed 28 percent of pollutants in Kathmandu Valley. Another study by the same government authority showed that out of 318 days when air quality of Ratnapark was studied, for 119 days the pollution level had crossed the safety standards. According to data with the Department of Transport Management, of more than one million vehicles registered in the Bagmati zone by 2017, nearly 90 percent were running inside Kathmandu Valley (Mandal, C., April 06, 2021).   The attached image shows that even 15 years ago from today, the biggest air polluter was the transport sector (which still is!).

A colleague of ours from UNHCR went out and took the following picture, through which we can tell that a year before, when the country was in full fledged lockdown and there were no vehicles commuting, the air was clean and the weather seemed good (April 2020). But now (April 2021), as the ‘new normal’ is in place and transportation has functioned as before and the wildfires around various part of the country has really detrimentally impacted the weather conditions.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

1. Value addition / Value proposition:  We at the Accelerator Lab have been in conversation with two of the solutions who are already working in this area with whom we have a good rapport with. One is Aeloi Technologies, which is a fin-tech company working with electric public vehicles in Kathmandu, and the other is Green Coins, which is a social enterprise working in providing carbon credits/green credits for those performing environment friendly activities. Both of these solutions were in touch with Accelerator Lab since the last year, who have experiences in inclusive digital innovations and digital transformations, and have an experience of working with women from marginalized communities for access to finances through digital platforms, green companies and businesses, and others.  Also, these two solutions are also archived in the UNDP and Hyundai's #ForTomorrow platform. Apart from this, the Lab's frontier challenge since the beginning has been unplanned urbanization, and air pollution and mobility issues fall very much under this frontier challenge.  2. Why Lab for this?  We co-design experiments with our grassroot innovators and we come with the luxury to make mistakes and learn from them, which other colleagues at UNDP don't have the privilege for. Also, our lab team academically come with knowledge in environment science, public health and business administration, which will help us to shape our behavioral science driven experiments that we are planning to conduct in the 2nd quarter of this year.  We are believers of joint intelligence, so we are in fact happy in joining hands with other stakeholders who are working in this issue so that we can form collective actions to shape our interventions going forth.   3. Why invest resources for this?  As mentioned earlier, Nepal ranks at 12th in the most polluted countries in the world (IQAir, April 6th, 2021). Apart from the wildfires, vehicular emissions leading to air pollution is skyrocketing. 673,000 vkm/day is in operation, which is much more than required. The Public Transport System in Kathmandu are not reliable, and not fully dependable (UNESCAP, 2016).  However, grasses are greener on the other side and Accelerator Lab in Nepal want to this hypothesis: " IF people are incentivized to perform environmental-friendly activities (such as using electric public transport system, cycling, walking near distances upcycling wastes etc) through the use of inclusive digital innovation tools and digital transformation technologies, THEN there will be shift in behavior resulting in promotion of a clean, green and healthy environment. "

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

A better transport sector plan with interventions to cut down the vehicular exhaust & introduction of environment-friendly transportation can avert 3091 to 15722 deaths due to air pollution. Hence, #AccLabNepal is coming with #smartmobility experiments to address this complex issue.
