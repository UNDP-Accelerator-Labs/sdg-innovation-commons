## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

GENDER NORMS, PATRIARCHY, AND MASCULINITIES
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is tackling gender norms in Jordan, which emerged from a patriarchal system of rule that is intertwined with masculine ideologies and create social injustices for people around the world. We are testing different ways to challenge the patriarchal system, masculine ideologies, and gender norms in Jordan, to see whether  they can carve out a space for new systems/ways of pursuing gender and social justice in the development sector.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In early 2020, as the world was shaken by COVID-19, the Accelerator Lab in Jordan mapped emerging trends during the lockdown period. One of these trends was the increase in discussion and content online about household chores and caretaking responsibilities, and particularly some men playing a more active role at home more than usual. This “positive deviance” signaled an opportunity  for an experiment --could a Twitter campaign sustain the conversation and change in behavior around men’s role in the household?  The campaign was developed with the support of Nudge Lebanon and UNDP’s Targeting Men, Transforming Masculinities (TMx2) agenda. The campaign, entitled “Our Home, Our Responsibility” tested whether it could play a role in sustaining discussions and behaviors that emerged online during the COVID-19 lockdown, namely 1) discussions on topics related to masculinities 2) men being more involved in housework and caretaking and sharing their experiences on social media. The campaign ran from December 2020 to January 2021. The campaign was measured through a quantitative approach by looking at the number of relevant tweets before and after the campaign experiment and examining trends, most commonly used keywords, level of interaction with tweets, number of new users that have joined forces in such discussions, sentiment of tweets over time, among others. The results appeared to “indicate a sustained increase of relevant tweets but only attributed to organizations.” “The sentiment of relevant Tweets during the period of the intervention appears to be downwards trending in general but with small increase of ‘Positive Tweets’ by men.” (Above analysis from the report produced by Nudge Lebanon: Post-experiment Sentiment Analysis and Summary of Findings) After this first experiment was completed, we reflected on the experience.  Some of the main lessons learned were: - the experiment felt a bit far from a  locally sourced potential solution.   - We could have done more to co-design the campaign with the people we intended to reach.  - We’re not sure that the way the experiment was set up to measure success was the most useful way.  -We could have considered a different metric and method of analysis, including qualitative analysis of the content of the tweets.  - Experiment not directly linked to  or integrated within existing UNDP pillar/programmatic work.  - International organizations are not nearly as well equipped to do work on this kind of change as local organizations and movements. So as UNDP we need to be very conscious of what our role is in addressing this challenge.  - Work on masculinities and gender identity is not necessarily under projects with the word "masculinity" in them. There are lots of intersectional topics.  - Toxic and positive masculinities are two sides of the same coin; they can’t necessarily be addressed separately.  -Only using "nudging" as a method is not enough to create behavior change. - Long term relationship building and dialogue are key for the success of this type of change, which takes time and cannot happen in one experiment over a short period of time.   Moving forward for this Action Plan (staring March 2021), we decided to do the following based on the lessons learned:  - Expand the human capacity of the Lab by seeing others as an extension of the lab mission and team→  - partnering with others to support them in running  experiments.    - Try shorter, simpler experiments  - Partner with local grassroots actors already doing work on this topic, especially those with multifactorial projects, strong relationships with their communities, and a long term commitment to their cause   - do experiments with multiple factors not standalone nudging or a standalone campaign   - Explore intersections with UNDP Jordan pillar projects   We also decided to REFRAME THE PORTFOLIO, which initially was called "Positive Masculinity" (or in a longer phrase, Changing Mindsets, Sentiments, and Behaviors around Positive Masculinity).   Reframing the portfolio:  We started off with framing as “positive masculinity” based on content that emerged during the lockdown. After the conclusion of the experiment, we learned more about the intersectionality of this topic as we engaged in conversations and brainstorming sessions with grassroots organizations. We also felt that the AccLab and UNDP should not be framing the portfolio in isolation of the ongoing work by grassroots organizations on this topic.  So far, a revised draft framing is:   PORTFOLIO OF EXPERIMENTATION  ON GENDER NORMS, PATRIARCHY, AND MASCULINITIES   Gender norms -which emerged from a patriarchal system of rule that is intertwined with masculine ideologies -create social injustices for people around the world. We are testing different ways to challenge the patriarchal system, masculine ideologies, and gender norms in Jordan, to see whether  they can carve out a space for new systems/ways? of pursuing gender and social justice in the development sector. Specific hypotheses will be developed at the level of the experiments linked to this high level framing.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab brings a unique flexibility in the development world to experiment and try something new without the constraints of funder agendas and status quo philosophies. This means that we can shift the narrative, the lens through which we approach the topic, and tackle it at a systemic level. Currently, few in Jordan are approaching this topic outside the framing of women's economic empowerment, gender based violence, and women in leadership roles. Also most are working with the usual actors -governmental, public figures,  international NGOs, and community based organizations (which are usually just doing whatever the NGOs ask them to do).    The AccLab's approach is different (and perhaps even radical) in its ambition to do the following:   1. call out of a bigger systemic issue -the patriarchal system  2. move towards working closely with grassroots movements and actors, including feminists  ethnographer/environmental psychologists, and community organizers   3. do multiple experiments at different levels -within and without UNDP programming.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

AccLab Jordan is testing ways to challenge the patriarchal system, masculine ideologies, & gender norms, exploring possibilities for new ways of pursuing gender & social justice in development. Complex, daunting, and a massive challenge? Exactly why we want to tackle it.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we tackle the patriarchal system, masculine ideologies, and gender norms in Jordan, ultimately to  carve out a space for new systems/ways of pursuing gender and social justice in the development sector? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The majority of data is related to women's economic participation and not as much about aspects of daily life. We are trying to get a more intimate understanding of people's daily behaviors and relationships with each other, especially through qualitative and ethnographic approaches. We also want to get a more in depth understanding of the reality of Jordan through a diverse coalition of local actors who have a more intimate understanding of the situation than international organizations.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Women's Coalition (newly launched group of allies working on women's rights in Jordan), any entity working on mass housing development
