> Title of the innovation

Soya Beans and Sunflower farming to cushion soyabeans by-products and cooking oil high demand in Zambia and possibly outside the country.

> Brief description of the innovation

Soyabeans being a source of many by-products such as soya milk, cooking oil, soya meal, soya pieces, animal feed and many other by-products has attained high demand on the market. It is for this reason that the price of soybeans has gone up besides the increase in expenses incurred during cultivation of the said product. This also has led to the increase in the price of the by-products for soyabeans. 
The price of cooking oil and other foodstuffs that use cooking oil have gone up too. The cost of a two litres cooking oil for instance, is now three times more than it was some few years ago whose increment can be attributed to the high demand on the market, low importation of the product perhaps due to the closure of some borders because of COVID-19, as well as the low production of the low material within the country. Thus, one of the best solution to the reduction in the price of cooking oil and other products that use cooking oil such as bread, fritters etc, is by increasing production of the row materials such as soyabeans and Sunflower.
Having acquired a traditional land in Chibombo rural area, I have always wished to cultivate the aforementioned products to help myself and the country at large. 
Due to lack of good capital, I tried to cultivate maize in the just ended farming season and the yield was very good. It was about 90%.
I believe, with adequate, I will be able to to realize my project.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Demand for soyabeans and Sunflower is currently high in Zambia as well as in most of our neighboring countries and this reduces competition on the market for the farmers. The said products have a variety of usage that give them high demand even for a lifelong period as more by-products are being discovered. Due to high demand, I am confident that I will be able to sustain myself, the business and a fraction of the Zambian population.
The price of a 50kg bag of soyabeans as at now is approximately K500 and is projected to go up in the next few months to come. After conducting some research on the cultivation of soyabeans and Sunflower, I realized that it is easier and slightly cheaper to cultivate the two mentioned products than other products like maize. This is on the advantage part for a farmer to sustain himself and the business.
On the other hand, the high production of such produce will see the reduction in prices of such commodities as feed which obviously affects the price of meat, chicken and other animal products such as animal milk, cheese etc. Also the price of cooking oil, bread, soya meal, soya milk etc are reduced which benefits the community at large.
Since, a number of simple machines are now coming in the country that can be used to make such by-products as cooking oil which may see the price of cooking oil for example, reduced and henceforth the reduction in prices for such foodstuff as bread, fritters and other cooking oil demanding foodstuffs.
The market for the products is so wide because a number of companies such as the Trade Kings are now producing soyabeans and Sunflower related products like soya pieces, tobwa and many more. As stated earlier on, even in communities there is demand for the two products because of the cheap simple machines present. Therefore, market is very wide for the two products.

> Technical Feasibility

On a traditional land sitting on sixteen hectares, I intend to clear and prepare enough land for the cultivation of Soyabeans, sunflower, maize and other produce. Soyabeans and Sunflower is intended for business while maize and other produce are meant for home consumption. Out of the total land, I want to use seven hectares for soyabeans and six hectares for sunflower while the rest of the land will be used for other produce such as maize, beans etc for home consumption.
Using the highest possible seed rate for soyabeans, I intend to plant about 90kg per hectare by seven hectares or 630 kg of soyabeans seeds. This is the least amount of soyabeans seeds, otherwise the maximum amount is about 100kg per hectare by seven hectares or 700kg of soyabeans seeds. The minimum number of 50kg bags of soyabeans seeds projected is 12.6 bags or 13 bags to the nearest whole number while the maximum number of 50kg bags of soyabeans seeds projected is 14 bags.
The density of sunflower I intend to plant using the maximum spacing is about 20 408 plants per hectare by six hectares. This implies that the total number of sunflower seeds I need is approximately 122 448 plants. 
I have a total minimum budget projection of approximately K45 000.
Soyabeans and Sunflower being among the farm produce mainly produced by commercial farmers who are approximately 80% producers of the products, I wish to be part of the small percentage of the producers who would be able to supply as low as community level.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project is likely to see the reduction in prices of such commodities as cooking oil, animal feed, meat, eggs, and other by-products of soyabeans and Sunflower. The project is likely also to attract foreign exchange because the demand on the two products is very high even in our neighboring countries. Therefore, if produced in huge quantities to sustain our country, the excess may be supplied to the outside countries to earn foreign exchange. This has a huge impact on the dollar-kwacha ratio which spreads also to the national economic growth.
Now that the demand on the two products is high, the project is very relevant and needs to be executed because, as seen, these products have impacts on the livelihood of individuals and the nation at large. 
The by-products of soyabeans are so healthy and recommended by health practitioners because of the high proteins found in soyabeans. For this reason, health community or country is promoted through the use of these products. This too, adds to the high demand on soyabeans and Sunflower.
