## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Local communities have the power and capacity to come up with policy-relevant solutions

2. The importance of solutions mapping tools and platform: Communities on the ground often come up with policy-relevant solutions. In this context, the use of tools and platform can help in them in the process of identifying and codifying grassroots solutions, as well as further promote knowledge exchange across different communities.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally
- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Through a Solutions Mapping Festival, the team showcased a number of grassroots innovations identified. This was a good opportunity to gain government's perspectives on the potential power of grassroots innovations for policymaking purposes. In addition, an open database (Solutions Mapping platform) was also developed in collaboration with our research partner. 

This approach has somewhat been picked up by government agencies (e.g., the National Planning Agency). The tools we generated have facilitated mindset shift in the sense that government agencies have started to recognize the value of adopting a community-based approach in policymaking. However, there has not been any specific outputs (e.g., solutions) identified through this project, which are taken up for scale by the government.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Ethnographic data and consultative workshops with several different communities helped us to identify grassroots innovations. These solutions are often not captured in government data. Meanwhile, the Solutions Mapping platform created an open-source database to facilitate knowledge exchange across different communities.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Government partners often do not have time and resources to identify, map, and unpack existing innovations at community-level. These methods help to address this gap: what solutions communities can contribute to both solve their daily problems and to inform policymaking.
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge.

> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

DE ITB primarily supports in designing Solutions Mapping Canvas. The solutions mapping canvas consists of a practical guide, field notes and canvas that facilitates anyone to immerse themselves in community dynamics, identify and systematically map grassroots solutions and their complexities. The canvas is expected to provide a deep understanding of the aspirations, solutions, needs, challenges, and opportunities that exist in the community. The canvas is made as simple as possible so that it can be understood and applied by various groups.

To expand the reach of using canvas in an inclusive manner, there are several strategic steps that we want to take: 

a. Design Inclusive Solutions Mapping Cards. The Solutions Mapping canvas will be redesigned and transformed into inclusive cards with contextualized, common glossaries and/or tailored to special needs. On-site consultation with communities is required to bring our Solutions Mapping cards to life efficiently and receive context-based feedback from communities.

Solutions Mapping Platform (Website). The refined tools, including the curated grassroots and social innovations, will be published on the Solutions Mapping website platform so that they can be accessed by the wider community.

Solutions Mapping Dissemination Event. Our learnings will be disseminated publicly to introduce our Solutions Mapping tools and highlight the importance of mundane and daily solutions to communities. The dissemination event aims to provide an exciting and stimulating setting for an enjoyable and worthwhile learning process about Solutions Mapping and Immersion methods.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This project was almost like a sandbox for UNDP. We had the freedom to explore different ways of thinking using the Solutions Mapping Cards that we designed. Due to the scope of this project, we were not bound by one specific issue area. Prototyping the tool gave us the possibility to incorporate bottom-up solutions into the programmatic work of other units and potentially, the government's policymaking.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
