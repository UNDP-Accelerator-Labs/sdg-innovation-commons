> Title of the innovation

To alleviate hunger levels by improved access of finances by farmers in Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Agricultural financing is one of the most important factors to develop rural areas in developing countries which will subsequently increase food supply and reduce on hunger levels.
This innovation will seek to eliminate financial constraints that farmers might face in trying to invest in farming activities and as such increasing productivity.
If farmers are to increase their level of production there is need for them to get some financial support through loans,savings and insurance so as to realize this goal.However, other farmers might want to avoid such facilities because of lack of knowledge on the facilities.Thus,it’s very important to engage everyone and educate them so that they are not excluded financially.Another reason why some farmers might shun away from these facilities such as loans is because of higher interest rates and unfavorable payment plans so there is need to take note of the former in trying to increase financial inclusion among farmers in Zambia.
Finally, this innovation will seek to provide financial support to farmers as well as education on financial literacy thereby leading to the alleviation of hunger in the country.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation is focused on improving farmers access to finance in view of alleviating hunger levels in the country.Thus an increased number of cheap loans will improve on access to farming inputs and subsequently increasing on food production in the country. High productivity will reduce food prices among among urban consumers and thereby improving the cost of living.
It is a known fact that agriculture is the main source of income among the rural people. Relative to other sectors agricultural growth can reduce rural poverty rates faster and effectively (Christianeansen and others 2011). And one relevant vehicle to achieve growth in the sector may be finance.

This innovation will empower more people including (youths,men and women) to take on farming on either a domestic or commercial scale.As a result this will reduce on the risks associated with rural migration.Rural-urban migration results in loss of Human Resources for rural areas, thereby reduces labor productivity.
When there is increase in labour,subsequently farming activities will be carried out effectively and efficiently thereby increasing in productivity.
The main focus for this innovation being improving farmers access to finance and as such farming improves the environment by creating a wonderful variety of landscapes that people might enjoy. This way agriculture encourages people to interact with nature in a positive way, inspiring them to conserve the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation will first seek to educate farmers on financial literacy this building on, on their will to seek access to finance and facilitate financial inclusion among farmers in Zambia.
This will be done through field visits which involves mobilizing groups of farmers or visiting them in their respective localities.
And for those that might have access to the internet,this group of farmers can be reached by making use of social media platforms.
After the first stage of the implementation is done. We would have educated farmers on financial literacy and as such they will be able to get loans or any other type of financing.
Depending on the amount of loans given out, a favorable interest rate has to be given out with a good payment schedule.

> Anticipated Social Impact

So this innovation not only strikes at improving the activities of farmers but also it creates a suitable environment for employment as more youths that have man power will be able to offer services of labour in farming activities but also for the purpose of this innovation employment will be created thus reducing the level of unemployment in the country.

Many farmers might want to diversify in their farming activities ie not just focus on growing agricultural products but also venture in other types of farming such as fish farming or livestock but they might face a challenge in implementation because of lack of funds so the coming up of this project will ease access to finance.
