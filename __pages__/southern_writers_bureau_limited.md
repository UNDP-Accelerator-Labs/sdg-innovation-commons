> Brief description of the innovation

we are a literary organization contributing towards bridging the many gaps that exist in the Zambian writing sector. We offer literary services ranging from editing, formatting, printing, ghostwriting, writing and publishing consultancy

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target market are writers that are looking to publish their work and earn from it and everyone else seeking literary services including printing, ghostwriting and consultancy. 
We generate income by selling literary services and hosting book exhibitions, writers workshops and other literary events. 
When scaled, our initiative will influence the creation of opportunities and  employment for various professions including lawyers, editors, marketers, distributors, etc, while empowering thousands of writers to publish and sell their works globally. Presently, we are reaching more than 17000 potential global clients through our 'How to Publish a Book' group on Facebook.
Our idea has been validated by emerging among the top finalists for the USADF fund after training under the US Embassy AWE/WEAC program and being selected for the Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship program 2021 under the disruptor category. 
The challenge prize will enable us to set up office and procure high end printing equipment and also help us train relevant personnel who will handle the equipment, to enable us print and publish international standard products.

> Technical Feasibility

Our business model is such that, we sell;
ghostwriting, editing, formatting, publishing assistance, publishing and consultancy services.
We organize paid events including;
book exhibitions, writers workshops and conferences
We offer publishing and printing services.
Our income generation for example for just one book ghostwriting is between K7,500 and K15,000. We get book printing orders of up to 1000 copies which is a range of anything from K20,000 and above.
Implementation from this point would go into setting up our office in Lusaka, purchasing equipment from China then scale operations, cutting out third parties as we have been outsourcing printing services, employ more support staff to further cut off third parties like for editing and graphic design and then start running an international book festival.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our idea will create employment, influence the growth and establishment of the creative writing sector in the country while empowering thousands of writers.
