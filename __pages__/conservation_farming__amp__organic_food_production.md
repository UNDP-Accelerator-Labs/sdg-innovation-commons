> Title of the innovation

Conservation Farming &amp; Organic Food Production

> Brief description of the innovation

Many villages and families in rural areas are deprived from the own fulfilment of the basic needs of food and power, and entrance to professional education. They lack the funds and the knowledge to escape from a for long times ongoing deprivation and poverty. They need to be educated and supported how to produce food and energy in practice in a more effective, profitable, and also in a sustainable way. Mukomela Consultancy is from its start dedicated to this challenge.
We believe that we serve the rural Zambian farmers most if we effectuate that they learn on a young age to practice a more profitable and effective production of their crops and energy, and in a way that their ecological footprint is minimalized.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We believe that we serve the rural Zambian farmers most if we effectuate that they learn on a young age to practise a more profitable and effective production of their crops and energy, and in a way that their ecological footprint is minimalized. At Mukomela Consultancy we connect the private sector to the world of impact financing to achieve financial, social, and environmental returns that are tangible, sustainable, and scalable. We are strongly committed to making a positive difference for our clients, for their customers and for this world.
Since our establishment we have successfully assisted NGO’s, companies, and initiatives to qualify for grants, loans, and equity from various impact finance sources, generally for projects in Africa. Where appropriate, we facilitate new B2B and public-private partnerships by leveraging our network and experience. In addition, we advise donor organisations and NGOs on private sector development in developing countries. Although we work across all economic sectors, most of our assignments are in the AgriFood and Renewable Energy sectors.  The core of our work is to attract funding and investment for the development of the social-economic projects and programs of our clients in rural areas of Zambia. We are one of the leading Financial and Capacity Solutions Providers in Zambia today for businesses houses, charity organizations &amp; others who seek our economic expertise.  We offer them a singular goal of providing comprehensive financial and capacity solutions that fulfil their value proposition, corresponding with our mission. 
We work in close partnership, performance based, and with full commitment to deliver the wanted results. We assist companies to access impact finance: grants, concessional loans and social equity intended to create positive impact beyond financial return. We connect impact investors to investible businesses and help them improve the performance of their portfolio by raising capital for their investees. And we are experts in qualifying NGO’s for grants for their private sector development programmes. We facilitate empowered by technology, digitization, and compelled by competitive pressures, enabled by data, and eager to connect directly with clients, companies, and organizations success, that is our goal.

> Technical Feasibility

The Organization is a Social Enterprise and operates with a purpose to empower the young generation through love, charity and voluntary work to enhance and propel education &amp; development in Zambia, and Africa in general by stimulating the idea of “aid from Africans to Africans” and self-reliance using a sustainable approach. The goal of “Our Conservative &amp; Sustainable Approach” is to support, network, and elevate outstanding young leaders ages 18–35 from across Zambia to amplify the impact of their work and inspire local innovation, promote a culture of sustained, citizen-responsive leadership. The concept of needs goes beyond simply material needs and includes values, relationships, freedom to think, act, and participate, all amounting to sustainable living, morally, and spiritually. In order to achieve this, we are  currently working on two projects:
1.	Promoting and teaching sustainable agriculture among local farmers in partnership with AgriHope a faith based organization. These lessons are offered for free through seminars and Boot Camps Cohorts in rural areas and also at our farms in Lusaka called “Umunthu Farms”. 
2.	School production units programs, whose purpose is to teach learners how to take care of themselves, others, wildlife and the environment through practical out door agriculture practices i.e building orchards, school gardens, piggery, chicken runs, fish ponds or dams, etc
3.	All these activities are communicated this is an Educational Magazine called “Umunthu Magazine” which acts as a tool to disseminate information in the form of quizzes, essay competitions, poetry, drama and storytelling and writing regarding our goals and objectives, hence, in the end promote a reading and writing culture among learners through a system called, “Promotion of Good African values and cultural ideologies” which modern kids are not taught or exposed to.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is a route to market concept for rural farmer’s produce, an initiative directed at inspiring young and women farmers to be more business minded towards agriculture, while focusing at ways and challenges they encounter with sales and marketing of Agriproduce. The initiative is built on two essential values. Firstly, one cannot value something until they know something about it, and secondly, learning takes place best in an interactive and conducive environment, delivered by great pioneers, who are in this case women and the youth. 
As a firm we recognized the need to address fundamental values and change the relationship farmers have with themselves, produce and market dynamics. The starting point is to know how and what to produce, from there choose to have better, salable high value crops and  livestock that will make farmers earn a decent living. Then, and only then can we start talking about what that future is going to look like, especially in relation with other sectors of the economy, synaergies and linkages in the industry that depend on or support agriculture. Our strategy has been to teach farmers sustanainble farming, add value to the produce, provide a market and teach farming as a business to village and rural communities.   
By using agriculture as a medium, we strive to stimulate self-respect, team spirit and a sense of wellbeing in youths and women; elements that are the foundation of a prosperous society.  By weaving farming and connecting farmers to buyers, the project aims to build a relationship of empathy between youths, women and buyers or the market so as to develop an interest for agribusiness from a young age and as a source of income for rural women.  
The main objective of this concept is to link Zambian rural youths and women to modern markets in Zambia’s elite communities, markets and beyond.  
We intend to do this through Mukomela’s unique mission and partnerships with organizations that will make income generating for farmers realistic, as we have mentors, marketers, strategists, platforms and linkages to partners and markets that possess highly developed produce, knowledge, exposure, skills and experience in Agrimarketing and Sales.  
Furthermore, this platform and marketing strategies from Mukomela will help each farmer to thrive and to be resilient in times of adversity, prosperity and economic growth. 
In the end we intend to have Zambian farmers who can compete favorably and professionally on a local and global agrimarkets.
