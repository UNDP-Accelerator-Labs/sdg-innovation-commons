GeoAI Platform to regulate air pollution 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that regulation of air pollution from brick manufacturing (brick kiln) industry is not up to the mark and there is a lack of data-driven approaches available to the regulatory authorities

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Air Pollution Monitoring has advanced in India but very little work on concrete abatement mechanisms. Awareness on air pollution is present in tier-1 cities of North India but that is not driving behavior (not wearing mask or using air purifiers) Public investments in air pollution multiplied from less than $1million in  2018 to $600 million in 2020. This will multiply further in 2021-26 Innovations in air pollution are at nascent stage in India, conducted in university labs or startups.  UNDP is almost a very small player in air pollution sector in India in 2019. Accelerator Lab sensed need for Air Pollution Portfolio in the next country plan. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Every winter, more than 140 million Indians are exposed to severe air pollution when the AQI crosses the hazardous mark of 300. Source apportionment studies reveal that the brick manufacturing sector contributes to 8-15% of North India's air pollution, which is nearly a quarter of the total pollution contributed by industrial emissions.

The research paper ‘Slavery from Space’  from the University of Nottingham showcased a novel approach of using geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence to detect the exact locations of brick kilns using satellite imagery. We connected with the University and teamed up with researchers from Rights Lab who are focussed on creating impact through research to help us identify such air pollution hotspots in India.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We have used both structured and unstructured data coming in from sensors, surveys, satellite data, and mobile data, socioeconomic data, administrative data, and open data across our portfolio of solutions. We have also created data partnerships and collaboratives to tap into some of the data sources. We are adding lot of new value to the air pollution sector and providing new intelligence through some of these alternative, unconventional datasets. The GeoAI platform demonstrated how environmental non-compliance can be detected from space using artificial intelligence. It significantly reduces the humongous task and investments required to regulate each and every industrial unit in India. 

The GeoAI platform is currently supporting the Governments of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha to improve environmental compliance of brick manufacturing industries in the three states. For example, in Bihar, GeoAI has mapped more than 7,800 brick kilns in the state using satellite imagery, out of which 1,000 units were prioritized based on non-compliance scores of which more than 600 units were inspected and acted upon by the regulators, significantly reducing investments and time needed for verifying non-compliance in brick manufacturing sector.

It is a novel approach for improving regulatory governance in India. The GeoAI platform brings together coordinated action from diverse stakeholders – regulators, government agencies, civil society, and volunteer groups to tackle the complexity around brick kilns.

We are partnering with Bihar State Pollution Control Board to roll out the GeoAI platform in their state. This agency is the key environment regulator for monitoring air pollution in the state of Bihar https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/mou-inked-to-check-pollution-through-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/80773918.cms

Technical collaboration &amp; data partnership for GeoAI platform: The research paper ‘Slavery from Space’  from the Rights Lab, University of Nottingham showcased a novel approach of using geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence to detect the exact locations of brick kilns using satellite imagery. After the research identified 47,000 precise locations of brick kilns, we connected with the University and now have a technical and data collaboration. AccLab has repurposed their research for air pollution and extended the research to classify brick kilns based on the environmental (non) compliance using AI algorithms and citizen science. This data is now part of the back-end of our technology platform (app+web-based) which is now being used by state environmental regulators for state wide implementation.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can #AI4Good through GeoAI platform improve environmental non-compliance for the brick kiln industry? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are introducing new methodologies through the above innovation methods. By generating targeted geo-intelligence (generated through satellite data, machine learning and citizen science), we are tackling challenges faced by environmental regulators to address large number of sources of air pollution spread across India.  We have used hackathons to identify unconventional solutions such as nature-based solutions for indoor air pollution. We are trying new methodology 'SDG Objects of Intersectionality' for sharp targeting of geographical hotspots/objects where multiple SDGs converge. For example we are working on brick kilns - hotspots of extreme air pollution, soil degradation, water degradation, bonded labor, child labor. (7 SDGs meet) 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Absence of geospatial and field data gaps are addressed by this solution
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

After the research identified 47,000 precise locations of brick kilns, we had multi-stakeholder consultations with government agencies and civil society. We have taken this proof of concept to the states of Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh for state-wide implementation. The goal is to make this into a pan-India platform and collaborate with national partners and build capacities of local authorities to strengthen regulatory governance by using GeoAI technology platform and enforce environmental and labor regulations in the brick manufacturing industry.

GeoAI platform is scaling in 2023 in three ways:

(1)  Lacuna Fund awarded $350,000 to add new sources of air pollution to the platform

(2)  University of Nottingham has raised grant for scaling GeoAI to 5 more states in India

(3)  Another grant awaiting in the pipeline for greening the brick kiln industry to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions.
