Selling ‘bila’, a traditional Fijian delicacy made from fermented cassava is a major source of income for many women from Tailevu, Fiji. To make bila: cassava is peeled, washed, and grated. Juice from grated cassava is left to sit for over four nights before cooking it, which takes approximately two (or more) days. It is a long process that usually takes more than six days. The end product is then sold for FJD$1 a piece.

Fermentation increases the amount of B vitamins in the cassava, therefore the process of making bila adds nutritional value to cassava.

Additionally, bila is usually made from leftover cassava crop from farms and market produce that were not able to be sold, so it has become an innovative way to address food waste.
