> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The Solar Kiosk project’s purpose is to promote solar cooking and show its benefits both for health and family economy, as well as the benefits for the environment as it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It consists of a car fully equipped with a Nina 120 solar cooker, removable waterproof roof, gas cooker with a 2 kg kitchen gas container as an energy alternative, conservator, garbage can, organizer drawer, water can, container for washing hands or washing dishes, a kit of black steel pots, 3 advertising boards, a stool and side tables; in addition, it includes the option of a lighting kit. Its function as a self-sustaining enterprise is that users cook with the sun on public roads and sell food. Its implementation is carried out through courses and follow-up in specific events when the Kiosk hits the streets. The challenge is to make this micro-enterprise work in a society that is very used to firewood and gas. In addition, it is intended for cooking healthy recipes with local raw materials, always considering the principles of safety and hygiene in street food sales. The ultimate goal is that each person who needs a solar cooker can get to know it and be encouraged to use it in their home, as this would minimize spending and maximize energy efficiency.
