> Title of the innovation

Helping Zambian people access quality health through a one to one stand with the community and the nation at large this will help us follow people than waiting for them to come

> Brief description of the innovation

My project is based on having a team of health workers willing to travel round the country to identify and deal with problems affecting the country. It helps us to be on the ground to see what areas us the health care providers need to take to the people, to achieve this it must be supported by having a chemist that will generate income which in turn will be used as means of moving from place to place, issues such as cervical cancer Tb and other serious sicknesses are a serious challenge to people in distant areas. But with this programme we wish to put that to a stop. A team of clinicians,nurses, ehc and others will be put together to meet the target of fighting disease

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

They say a healthy nation is the wealthy nation, for far too long Zambian living in rural areas have not had the required treatment. But this could come to an end as the team put up would be making sure we move to treat conditions and if ones seen can't be managed at ground the referring the patient to higher health facilities so they can access the required treatment. The chemist that would be open would also generate income to meet up with requirements  say transportation of health workers from point to point and  meeting their needs too 
It has been worrying that despite Zambia been second in terms of cervical cancer cases over the past years we still have women in villages that have never done a cervical cancer screening or that uncircumcised people are still uncircumcised  in villages. This is what we want to work towards giving each Zambian equal health care services

> Technical Feasibility

The main aim is to build a structure that will be able to do disease identification and then go on the ground  to treat people, there is high demand of drugs but limited access the chemist will have all drugs that a person could possibly access, a cervical cancer screening room, x - ray facility and a lab just there to even do checkup on people all these services will help generate income that we then will use to take good health to the Zambian people with limited chance to access the treatment  on their own.
People are looking for solutions in witch doctors for conditions that the health care providers can treat with minimal effort.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This will reduce the cost of drugs and other health services that the government use money on, if we can identify certain conditions on time they are very manageable and this will mean that the government else direct certain resources to other productive ventures such as agriculture or education 
Remember a healthy nation is a wealthy nation. Offering ground health services will improve the lives of the people and making Zambia a great place to be and do business.
This proposal is very relevant when we look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
