> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Solar Fiji designed and installed one of the biggest residential off-grid solar power systems in the South Pacific—in Port Vila Vanuatu. The solar energy system produces enough power for two house, a large swimming pool with water pumps and filtration system, fridges, freezers, fans, lights, and aircon. The system is an environmentally alternative to traditional grid-powered homes, and will save the owners of the home approximately US$14k in the first year alone.
