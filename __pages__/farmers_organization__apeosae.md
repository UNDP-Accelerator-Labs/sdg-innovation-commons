“I was born to a rural and humble home. I was always my mother´s the 
head of the household. Knowing the needs of farming people and their 
exploitation, I proposed myself to create a second level organization 
called APEOASAE. We dedicate ourselves to ecological farming and we even
 have exportation products. A month and a half ago a landslide took away
 over 20,000 cacao plants, but that doesn’t bring me down”. José Alonso Castillo


Farmers association as a way to combat exploitation. José Alonso told his story in Ecuador´s AccLab Human Library Event in January. He overcame extreme poverty and when asked how, by a person from the audience, he says it´s a result from organizing, staying together with other farmers. He´s known for his blockchain chocolate; "The other bar".
