> Title of the innovation

Tilute Site Seeing Tours

> Brief description of the innovation

Our Innovative Solution is an urban and cultural virtual tour initiative that aims to promote Zambia’s history, cultures (past/present), folklore, history and artefacts. Contributing to a more organic and inclusive tourism that introduces tourists to the Zambian people (and all their contributions) and brings history and culture to life. 

Using video and virtual technologies, the team would record virtual tours of different aspects of Zambia's culture, history, people and natural wonders, bring it all to life with storytelling, suspense and intrigue. Promoting new ways of tourism, while making it more accessible, inclusive and organic.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our Innovation will primary make income through
Tours (virtual and post COVID-19 physical) – our main business model will come from the tours which we will conduct at a competitive rate on a platform we will create and through other strategic platforms like AirBnB experience. The tours will be us using storytelling taking our guests on a tour and earning revenue from it. Post Covid19 we intend to launch physical tours as well to compliment the innovation. 
Further through exposure from our tours, strategic partners and community tourism initiatives would be able to benefit directly through sales and other opportunities.

Our target market includes but is not limited to 1. the Zambian expatriate community 2. Global north tourists 3. adventure-seeking and early adopter millennials and early gen Z (22 - 40) 4. Zambia's art/culture follower community 

The Prize money will help the team and innovation partly fund the necessary equipment, software and tech required to be able to create, edit and publish in the best standard available. The team is ready to bootstrap and fund other parts of the required funds.

The innovation is a minimum environmental disturbance innovation, allowing sites, history, culture etc. to be explored with little degradation to the environment/habitat.

> Technical Feasibility

A virtual tour (like physical tours) will involve a tour guide being recorded in high resolution video, taking someone on a tour and explaining things just like a physical tour. The most important technical ingredient is a high resolution paranomic video camera.
The team is compromised of theatre practitionals, storytellers and tech/video experienced individuals who would be able to create, shoot, edit and publish tours on our platforms and external partners.

Our plan is to procure the equipment, create, record, edit and publish tours on our platforms, while building, exploring/creating partnerships with platforms.
During this period we would also build our own platform from our website.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We believe our innovation can have the following relevance and social impacts which are interrelated

1. Promotion and support of macro community tourism businesses - through exposure/partnerships from our tours/innovation local/community tourism businesses would be new markets availed to them helping them grow and sustain themselves.

2. A better understanding of Zambian life and culture by international tourists - this would increase Zambia's standing in the international arena, contributing to positive news that would encourage more tourists from around the globe to visit Zambia, directly and indirectly contributing to the development of Zambia and its tourism sector.
 
3. Promotion and preservation of Zambian culture, history, artefacts and folklore - which would increase the sale and demand for Zambian tourism and the different business sectors. It would also enable that Zambia's tourism is sustainably consumed with future generations continuing to benefit from the innovation.
 
4. A more organic and inclusive approach to tourism - meaning even those who can afford to travel will be able to still enjoy the experience and like point number two either be compelled to visit the area for themselves or still be able to understand Zambia organically.
