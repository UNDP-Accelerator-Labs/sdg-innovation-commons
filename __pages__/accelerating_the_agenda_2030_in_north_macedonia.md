## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Accelerating the Agenda 2030 in North Macedonia
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Can we bring new ideas, ways of thinking and innovation into the public debate in

North Macedonia on how to move the Agenda 2030 forward?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In North Macedonia the predominant agenda in the public policy discourse is the EU, and the EU accession process of the country. The country has had an EU candidate status since 2005, for what has proven to be a prolonged accession process. However, the EU agenda is still the dominant one in the country, and shapes public debates/discourse, and political action.  

What is relevant for us, is that there are clear complementarities between the EU accession process, and the Agenda 2030. Moreover, public policy conversations on the SDGs can help us overcoming the political and social polarization in the country, by offering a thematic driven conversation on policy. So, what we are trying to test is if we can bring new thinking, innovations into the public debate in north Macedonia, related to the Agenda 2030.

From few scoping studies and internal research processes, we know that students do not recognize the SDGs, nor do they align them with any national, local processes. We also know that the private sector is not familiarized with the Agenda 2030, while at the same time they do have good practices that advance the Goals.  Moreover, the VNR's are not prepared systematically, and political entities rarely focus on the Agenda 2030 in the public discourse.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Three reasons: 

The Lab is uniquely positioned to put to the forefront community solutions, ideas, processes, innovations that can contribute to, or accelerate the Agenda 2030.  

The Lab can conduct experiments on how to bring to the public discourse new ideas that contribute to the achievement of the Goals.  

The Lab by design works in a collaborative manner with all portfolios in the country office, and can gather input from all three core programmatic offers.
