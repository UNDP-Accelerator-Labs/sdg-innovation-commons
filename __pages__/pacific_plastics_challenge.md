## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Pacific Plastics Challenge
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that if we are able to nudge the shift towards a circular economy through locally contextualized innovative approaches to upstream, mid-stream, and downstream interventions, we can move away from the current take make waste model.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Increased production of plastic products, coupled with poor waste management has left our environment laden with plastic waste that is threatening natural ecosystems and biodiversity. In the Pacific, there is limited capacity for recycling and majority of plastic waste ends up in landfills, is burned in open fires which releases harmful toxins into the environment or is discarded in unsanitary open dumpsites where there is a high risk of this plastic waste leaking into the environment and posing a serious threat to the Pacific’s most precious resource – our Ocean. In analyzing the plastics value chain, we recognized that there are contributing factors to this complex issue at every stage of the plastics lifecycle – from production, manufacture, utilization, to disposal. After conducting interviews with various stakeholders in the plastics space, a recurring issue expressed by many stakeholders was the difficulty in changing behavioral mindset. For instance, it has become common to use single-use plastic products every day, and many people do not pay a second thought to the way these are disposed.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Based on the collectively identified core drivers, the UNDP Accelerator Lab (Fiji) team will be testing a combination of solutions that can create and support the conditions for a circular economy for plastics. Possible entry points include awareness and capacity building programs with youth and people living in marginalized conditions, support for improved waste segregation systems through innovative methodologies and technology, support for improved data collection and sharing, and exploring feasibility and gauging business sector appetite for policies such as extended producer responsibility in the local context. While the learning process is still in early stages, we are strongly optimistic that a system approach, involving communities, government, and private sector, has the potential to catalyze a transformational shift towards a circular economy that is crucial for the security, health, and protection of our planet and people.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

A deep dive into the upstream, mid-stream, downstream life cycle of plastics to explore approaches to influencing the shift to a circular economy in the Pacific, with Fiji as a deep demonstration site.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Collective Intelligence- Will provides an inclusive approach to co-designing locally contextual and relevant solutions to a complex challenge such as the plastics Design Thinking- Will create a better understanding of how the system is conducting itself, including how the stakeholders are positioned within the problem space Ethnography- Will help to examine the behaviour of different components in the ecosystem and how they are influencing each other Solutions Mapping- Will help to bring about diverse approaches and views including innovators who are positively impacting the plastics economy System Thinking- Will help to understand multi-faceted aspects of each part of the system is working together and influencing each other

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These sources provides an additional layer on the ongoing work on plastics issue in the Pacific. It helps to inform for example, the hidden narratives on waste pickers, the women and children who work in the waste management space. It also helps to add value, for example using drone to identify the plastics/waste hotspots, as well as supplementing and complementing existing data.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The private sector- to form coalitions within the private sector and harnessing the coalition to bring about an integrated approaching to help solving the plastics menace in the pacific.
