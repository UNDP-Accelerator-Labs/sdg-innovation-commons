> Title of the innovation

Ulwimbo Music Library

> Brief description of the innovation

Ulwimbo.com is an African music lyrics library and musical information database. The majority of African musical artists, especially in Southern Africa, have no specific place on the web where people can find a full catalogue of their music and how to buy it. 

This means they are missing out on significant potential revenue gains. In view of this, one of Ulwimbo's core aims is to make African artists and their work more discoverable online through a comprehensive online music catalogue. 

Having run for a little less than a year, Ulwimbo's statistics indicate a serious demand for information on African artists and their music online. That demand is grossly unmet but Ulwimbo is the solution.

Ulwimbo also aims to build an online community that explores the depth and richness of African culture and society as reflected in song lyrics and other related forms of art.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

People from across Africa and the globe have expressed deep interest in the content on Ulwimbo. This can be seen from the amount of organic traffic being received and the searches people try to make on the site. 

Once it reaches a certain amount of traffic, we can make marketing deals with companies that have a customer base around Southern Africa. We can also promote musical events and process digital tickets as that is a service that is not yet widely available in Zambia and the countries around. 

Ulwimbo, with the right amount of traffic and resources, can also have its own music-centred print-on-demand service that can help African musical artists earn more from their efforts. 

The Ulwimbo Music Library has proven potential for significant traffic in Southern and indeed Sub-Saharan Africa. Once it gets that traffic and attention, there are numerous ways to monetize it, some of which are listed above.  

What is most needed, at least for now, is human resource. Ulwimbo needs writers and transcriptionists to populate the site with content.  That is where even a little funding would go a long way.

> Technical Feasibility

Ulwimbo.com is a website built on WordPress and Elementor. With more resources, it will have to shift to a more customised content management system. 

At the moment, all that is needed is to have more manpower in form of writers. However, once we have more users, we will need software developers for more security and stability. Developers will also be needed to add features like the print-on-demand service.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Ulwimbo will help African musical artists be more discoverable online and earn much more from their work. Our aim is to enhance the online presence of as many African musical artists as possible by having their work indexed online. 

To add lyrics by an artist from say, Tanzania or Congo, we will need someone who actually understands the native language of that country. This means Ulwimbo will create jobs for writers and transcriptionists in different African countries. These people will also enjoy the benefit of working from home.
