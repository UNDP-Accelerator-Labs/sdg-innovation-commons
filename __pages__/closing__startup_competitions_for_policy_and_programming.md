## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1- 90% of early stage climate tech entrepreneurs in our pool are registered in the same country of residence of the founder (majority in Egypt and Nigeria), which means, working on conducive regulatory environment is key not only for the scale up of startups but in creating a venture pipeline.

2- majority of startups registered outside country of residence resort to US, UK, or UAE. Part of that because of incentivizing regulations but also because of concentration of investors. Hence, developing an ecosystem require educating and building a strong pool of local investors to prevent all the economic benefits going overseas.

3- Climatech startups in the energy sector are present more within the deeptech space, while agrifood ones are more present in shallow tech. This means more catalytic investments need to be done to boost advanced research and development for climate adaption.

4- Funding source for our pool of 400 startups are clustered mainly in boot strapping, loans, and grants. Private funding from angel investors, VCs, and other are much lacking presenting a real gap in the investment space

5- Positive outliers in terms of raised fund and generated revenues are mostly in the Energy, transportation, and waste management sectors, climate adaptation technologies are not receiving same attention and financial support. 



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

the design and process was picked by the government who were the main partners in the experimentation phase. learnings have been presented to development partners, government, and private sector audience during COP28. Replication of the methodology is set to be done through the next phase of the competition, while other scaling opportunities are being explored for other competitions with different local partners. The learning and insights on our cycle questions are being compiled in a knowledge piece that will be published soon including recommendations for policy and programming for climatech entrepreneurship support.


## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

startups competition data are available and abundant and they are hardly used beyond choosing winners. However this kind of data is very useful and specific since it is filled by startups themselves and can be used to draw real life gaps and opportunities. Using this kind of data also opens the space for scalability once proven valuable.
