> Title of the innovation

Research on plants protein found  to replace soya in future

> Brief description of the innovation

I have carried a research project innovative which shows higher proteins than soya and the test textual is more of meant and I am very sure it can takeep over from soya if production is at larger scale.  This plant based is grown by our local small scale farmers all over the the country. It is also a kind of of fruit vegetable. This is a Zambian owned research initiated  by Dr. Vincent Nyendwa .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

On the value addtition of innovation on environment is that most this is produced organically product without the use of chemical fertiliser.  Moreover,  the innovation has no environment impact.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed by even people with basic knowledge,  all we is how to package and preserve product after preparing for export. The first implementation plan will  be training farmers to grow the crop in bulk so that it is available for purchase and later addate value and packaging for sale.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Non meant protein are very important in the sense that meat products are characterised with a number of diseases. A lot of people have also relised the importance of non meat protein for their healthy.  The market is available both locally and abroad.
