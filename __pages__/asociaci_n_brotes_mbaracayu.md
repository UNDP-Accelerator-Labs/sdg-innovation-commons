> Description

We are an organization made up of young rural women, students and professionals from different parts of the country based in the City of Villarrica Guairá that works to promote the Sustainable Development Goals in different areas such as academia, civil society and local governments. Having as prioritized objectives the SDG 12 of responsible production and consumption, we also seek the empowerment and visibility of women and girls promoting equity, creating spaces aimed at women where they can develop skills to strengthen their capacities, expand their possibilities of access to the labor market and thus dignify their quality of life and their environment.
