Overall goal: Conduct a census of the entire tree population in the chief town of the district (Bragado) for future public policy-making Specific goals: • Expand the urban tree census to the remaining towns located in the District of Bragado. • Create technical and scientific material based on the surveys conducted. • Identify and solve issues related to urban forests in the medium and long term. • Plan public strategies for proper tree care and pruning. • Set solid foundations for future landscape designs to be used for city planning, based on such previously assessed needs. 

Description of citizen participation: Citizens collect tree census data using a mobile app, after having been trained (both on the operation of the app and on the botanical knowledge required for tree identification).
