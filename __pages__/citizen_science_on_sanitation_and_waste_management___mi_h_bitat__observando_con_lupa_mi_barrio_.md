Objectives: 

• Raise awareness among young people and families on the health risks posed to their communities by dumping sites, rodents and parasites.

• Together with the education community, encourage the most vulnerable neighborhoods (due to this type of pollution) to trigger actions that will improve their quality of life. 

Description of citizen participation: Workshops were conducted to identify potential sanitation issues existing in participants’ neighborhoods. Based on such issues, an app was adapted, and possible preventive measures were discussed.  At said workshops, the following main issues were identified: 

· Dumping sites

· Reuse of certain materials

· Compost made from organic waste

Within 15 days, young people grouped in work teams sent—using the app— images showing areas of their neighborhood, mostly photos of dumping sites and rodents, which pose potential health risks to their communities. Once neighborhood mapping was completed by the work teams, workshops were conducted to discuss findings and possible management actions.
