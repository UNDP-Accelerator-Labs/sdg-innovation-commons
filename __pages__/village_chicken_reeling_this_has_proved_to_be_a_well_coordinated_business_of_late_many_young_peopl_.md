> Brief description of the innovation

This project has proved to be a great deal knowing that Zambians have the capacity to buy foods from markets which are saturated with low quality market of the Chinese chickens. The project has so many advantages including the agriculture sector and also the transport sector will not be left out into the revolving fund sector. The Chinese market has contributed to the country’s poor health and malnourished people with low quality good health growth Zambia has been subjected to this when the locals have the capacity to produce a good quality high village chickens which the same Chinese are busy buying at an increased market price.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project is viable for Zambia for a long time now have been subjected to low quality and poor diets henceforth the country has proved to be producing malnourished children of late.village chickens are easy to keep and doesn’t need a lot of money to support the projects. The transport market will also benefit when taking the project to the market and also the agriculture sector will not be left out for good quality manure for the good harvest of crops.The value chain of the project will make it less competitive to other market players for their business is of low quality grade. The project has proved to be a great deal for the young and the vulnerable people and its self reliance capital which has proved to be a revolving funds also to other beneficiaries for a stater up project.

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation plan for the project is the already human capital which we have. The market capital of Democratic republic of Congo which has proved to be a reliable market place is so significant and the already readily available market here in Zambia has demonstrated its support and capacity for the project and its support. Zambia for a long time now has been subjected to chicken of low grade a specialty of the Chinese market which has proved to be a of low quality and a danger to human consumption of late. The project will also be implemented in other areas as in phases of a pilot project and its objectives will to do away with the local Chinese modified chickens which has dominated the market of late. The village chicken project is cheap and self reliance for the chicks doesn’t take a lot of time to hatch and manure will also be recycled into something that will add value to the agriculture sector.some of the challenges of the project are not difficult to overcome and will adequately address them for the positive outcome in our country and we’re ready for the Chinese low grade market.

> Anticipated Social Impact

( 1 ) self reliance as the market is readily accessible 
2) the business is of high quality and easy to run 
(3 ) village chicken fical matters can also be used as manure 
(4 )Village chicken project are easy and available without even incubators 
(5 ) transporting of the village chicken to the market will also impact positively to the transporter and also the consumer
