## 

Housing speculation makes it unaffordable to have adequate and decent housing to many families in Madrid. Mortgage legal framework is in favor of banks and posing 30-40 year debts to people. The solution: Entrepatios is the first eco-social housing cooperative in use rights in Madrid. •Collective property instead of individual property. •Participatory, climate and social responsible. <br>
