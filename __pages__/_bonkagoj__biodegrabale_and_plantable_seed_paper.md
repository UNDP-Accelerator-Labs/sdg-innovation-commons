## The Challenge

The mounting piles of paper waste in landfills are a growing concern. Yet, abruptly curbing consumption of such products in a country still grappling with enhancing its digital infrastructure is challenging.
## The Solution

Shalbrikkho, a startup based in Narayanganj (a secondary city in Bangladesh) is dedicated to biodegradable and recycled products. They developed,  'Bonkagoj' a plantable seed papers which are biodegradable handmade papers embedded with various plant seeds.  The process involves collecting and shredding waste papers, turning them into pulp, and embedding different seeds. The seed paper takes approximately 22 hours to make, with a daily production capacity of 50 pieces. Customized machinery and careful seed selection, emphasizing organic farming and bird sustenance, underpin this innovative endeavor. When Bonkagoj contacts damp soil and the right conditions, the seeds germinate, allowing sprouts to emerge from the paper. Although thicker and pricier than traditional paper, efforts are underway to create thinner versions suitable for writing. Prices vary based on size and weight, with potential for reductions through large-scale production. Such papers offer a compelling solution to paper waste in Bangladesh.
