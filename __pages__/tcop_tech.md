> Brief description of the innovation

Tcop is a management information system for education establishments used to manage student data. Our innovation provides capabilities for registering students in classes; documenting grading, transcripts of academic achievement and co-curricular activities, and the results of student assessment scores; forming student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing other student-related data needs in an educational institution. Tcop Provides this in order for Schools to be more productive and effective. The innovation offers a creative assistance in reducing overhead costs that are created by the nature of those business. The core value is to allow Zambian schools to have the opportunity/ ability to deliver their education services over the internet. Because of our core value, our innovation gives school teachers the ability to create academic courses online. Teachers put their course materials digitally and students can access them from home and continue studying anytime. Apart from that, school teachers can create Homework online. Meaning Teachers digitally put their assignment questions or home works inside the school portal. and students can answer the assignments from their home. Teachers can review the submitted answers from students and give marks for them. The Main focus is empowering Zambian schools to achieve their education capabilities.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Tcop is focusing on the Education Market, targeting Education Institutions that want to improve their infrastructure in Information Technology. All Education Institutions that operate on a Regular basis are potential clients. The Business structure will be B2B, Business to Business. The subscription model is utilized for income generation for the innovation, a termly and yearly fee are used payment plans. The current situation is that majority of Zambian schools operate in a physical occupied space called campus, which is a limitation towards expanding their educational services out ward. Our innovation improves on the value, by giving Zambian schools the ability to deliver education outside their campus using internet infrastructure. Our innovation is being used by very few school, which is very unfortunate for its potential. Plans of expanding are very slow due to the financial limitation. therefore, financial aid from this completion will exclusivity go in the budget for expanding the innovation. To be specific the budget will include marketing, training and support costs for are targeted clients.

> Technical Feasibility

The Education Market shows a continues Growth in the demand for more education institutions. Due to the growth in the population, the need for more Basic Schools, high Schools, College and universities grows along with it. While the need for education is an individual need, it creates a need for institutions to manage their growing institution more efficiently without loss of control. Our innovation is designed to address continues efficiency despite institution growth. The Demand for Education Management products and services that offer more values and satisfaction continue to be demanded. Within the Education Market, there is a Loss of control over resources (for instance teachers, classroom, paper usage) as institution grows, this state of self-deprivation creates a need for returning the management of resources, of which there is a want of finding a way to return the control. Our innovation provides way to allocate resources. From a student point of view, our innovation brings in a new way of leaning over the internet. The social benefit of using internet for learning includes revisiting a topic that you missed during lecture or want to revise. Teachers will not be limited to the boundaries of a classroom in order to teach.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation is designed to be used online, all the functionalities are tied to internet. The innovation can be accessed in three methods; browser, Android app and Desktop app. Tcop has an already working product, it left its prototype phase last year. A user of a smartphone can quickly learn the way to use the app. it was designed to be very easy to use, in order to cover the whole user base of teachers and students in the institution. The other main design is including the usefulness of the innovation. Immediately any user logs into the application, what they need to perform is clearly indicated. The perceived usefulness is important to improve the usability. The implementation plan includes two phase, first phase involves installing the innovation in the school, then other phase is the training of all user that be using the innovation. Training users is important to ensure proper usage of the tcop.
