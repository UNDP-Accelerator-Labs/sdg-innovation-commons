With over 400 entries, Majalla.mv is one of the largest digital repositories in the Maldives, aiming to revive the old and lost Dhivehi magazines and books. The e-library is continuously expanding with new additions of various magazines every week and readers are now able to access some of the oldest documents in Dhivehi, with convenient features such as ability to search and copy text. At a time when the preservation of the country’s linguistic heritage is threatened, a solution such as Majalla.mv encourages the use and preservation of Dhivehi language by making it easier for students, researchers and public to access Dhivehi literature.
