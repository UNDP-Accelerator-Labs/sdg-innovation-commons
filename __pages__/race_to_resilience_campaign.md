> Description of the solution

The race to resilience is the UN-backed global campaign to catalyse a step-change in global ambition for climate resilience, putting people and nature first in pursuit of a resilient world where we do not just survive climate shocks and stresses, but thrive in spite of them.  The Campaign is led by the High-Level Climate Champions for climate Action.  The campaign seeks to catalyse action by non-state actors that builds resilience of 4 billion people from vulnerable groups and communities to climate risks, by 2030.
