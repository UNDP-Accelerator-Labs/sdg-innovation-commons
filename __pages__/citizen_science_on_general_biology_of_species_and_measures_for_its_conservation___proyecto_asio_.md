Overall goal:  Collect information to know the general biology of the species in Argentina and adopt measures for its conservation. Specific goals:  Learn about the current status of the species and its conservation problems. Understand the distribution, habitat and threats to the species by province.  Prepare an annual report based on the information obtained from the observers' records.

Description of citizen participation In some cases, citizens participate by raising conservation issues for certain populations. In addition, they are responsible for collecting data from species observations, posting the records in a Facebook group.  Participants are requested to upload photographs and include geographic location, coordinates, description of the environment, possible disturbances and number of birds. In the case of a nesting record, the number of eggs or chicks and their description should be added.  If the recordings are conducted in areas that could become potential protected areas, citizens will coordinate future conservation efforts involving the project and the landowner.
