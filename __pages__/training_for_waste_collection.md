- Public Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Municipalities, Local Universities, Local schools


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to know if educating people about the waste management generates an attitude of change that allows good waste management practices. This experiment is important to learn if training sessions are useful to adopt behaviors, as they many not be needed or enough to overcome barriers. Also, it's important to learn if training sessions have different effects on different groups. 



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If people are educated on how to classify their waste, then more people will adopt practices to classify and manage waste



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The first step is selecting a sample of potential participants for this experiment. Ideally, we should invite twice as many as necessary due to the rejection rate. It should be considered that the invited people have similar socioeconomic characteristics. Once the list of participants is ready, those who will receive training on how to classify waste and those who will not be assigned through a lottery. Assigning by lottery helps determine the effectiveness of the training (randomly). After separating the participants, an initial measurement of knowledge of waste classification and its implementation should be made, either through an inspection, interview/questionnaire, or a diary. After the training, another measurement of their knowledge about waste classification and its implementation should be made. Those who didn’t receive the training on waste classification could receive training on the use of digital technologies, drafting, negotiation or another unrelated topic. Three weeks after training, a follow up session would be implemented to learn about their experience putting in practice.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

People participating  in the training.



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We´d collect data from direct observations, interviews, diaries.



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 Month



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
