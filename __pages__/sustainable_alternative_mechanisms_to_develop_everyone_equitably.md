> Title of the innovation

Sustainable alternative mechanisms to develop everyone Equitably

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovative is to provide alternative mechanisms to improve or upscale the production levels of all through the provision of the services and products that will allow even small scale farmers to farm all year round with less labor but on improved levels of production. Services such as solar water system, irrigation system and fish farming.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through service provision that calls for a group work hence giving opportunities to income for all. The target market is everyone ready to go into green energy, improved farming systems (farmers) and anyone who wants to get into fish farming. The systems which has so far proved to be efficient and environmental friendly. The irrigation system helps to farmers to reduce on water wastages but giving the required amount of water to crops hence improving productivity.

> Technical Feasibility

The solar water system vary depending on client preference. We have surface pumps and submersible pump which all works clean energy. These are implemented to help reduce long term costs as once installed the end users can concentrate on production without other systemrunning costs. Irrigation system are designed to reduce the cost of production and can be used for over three farming seasons.
Following that our services are flexible with location in that can be used anywhere without difficulty.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Solar water system will increase access to clean and safe water so as to reduce water related diseases. This is a one off cost that comes with a lot of long term benefits reducing the burden of things like machine run on fuels. 
We plan to have our services be recognised and appreciated even by those in rural areas so as they can improve there production and contribute to the national GDP. Irrigation systems such as drip systems uses less water but yet gives improved production which gives a farm more income with less stress and at a reduced cost. 
Through green energy fish farming can be realised as water can be made available thereby increasing community and household income.
