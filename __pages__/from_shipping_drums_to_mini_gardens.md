From Shipping Drum to COVID Survival Mini Garden

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

In my childhood village, I observed swathes of blue in almost every backyard. They turned out to be mini vegetable gardens being cultivated in old shipping drums, which people started when COVID-19 began to impact Barbados. I spoke with Angela, who said she's been planting everything from eggplants to beans to lettuce to herbs -- out of necessity and as part of their efforts to stay active during the lockdown. She and her neighbors are doing it all organically, without chemicals. In addition, the community is recycling the water drums and experimenting with rainwater harvesting, instead of irrigating with water from the country's stressed water supply system.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Barbados is a country heavily dependent on food imports -- and faced the harsh reality of a dwindling food supply at the height of the pandemic. In addition, it is classified as a water-scarce country, an issue that climate change has exacerbated. This solution encourages sustainable community agriculture where land space is limited but the need for food and nutrition is high. It addresses multiple needs for food, water conservation, and income.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

There are many lessons to be learned. Here are some of them:
1. When communities work together to solve a common problem, there can be viable solutions.
2. Start where you are, use what you have -- in their small backyards, with recycled shipping barrels/drums, and homemade agriculture solutions, this community is saving money, saving water, and eating well.
3. Be willing to experiment. -- Not every vegetable they've tried has succeeded. The okras didn't work out well, neither did some of the herbs but that hasn't deterred them.
