Public Sector Innovation Changemakers Journey &amp; Playbook for civil servants 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is a lack of locally relevant guidance and tools for civil servant to innovation within the context of public sector of Vietnam. How might we provide locally relevant guidance and tools for civil servants to innovate within the context of public sector of Vietnam, so that they can improve their capacity, skills, and resources to design and implement effective policies and programs that respond to complex and emerging development challenges? 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Viet Nam has a history of change and reform since Doi Moi in the 1980s, it continues to look for new ways to grow that’s rapid and sustainable. While dealing with many emerging challenges, such as global economic downturn, middle-income trap, climate change and environmental degradation. These problems require innovative solutions that involve the communities and understand their needs. The public sector plays a key role in finding these solutions, but it needs to innovate itself and find ways to bring in more diverse voices to the policy-making table.

Since 2016, the Vietnamese government has adopted the idea of “Chính Phủ Kiến Tạo” (Constructivist or Developmental Government). This means a government that enables and empowers all sectors and forces of society to participate in development; that fosters innovation and creativity; that uses digital transformation and smart governance; that ensures transparency, accountability, and integrity; and that responds proactively and flexibly to emerging challenges. This shows a willingness to move from traditional top-down state management to serving people and putting citizen needs at the center of development. This mindset change is not unique to Viet Nam but has been influenced by global trends, such as budget cuts in the public sector, environmental degradation, rising demands from more educated and globally aware population.

Over the past decades, Viet Nam has made remarkable achievements in economic development based on innovation and the application of advances in science and technology. The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2022 showed that Viet Nam ranked 48 out of 132 countries and territories and belonged to the group of countries that have made the greatest progress over the past decade. Studies at Viet Nam Venture Summit 2022 showed that Viet Nam was in the golden triangle of Southeast Asia for investment in innovation in general and startups in particular.

According to UNDP and NIC report, process innovation is the most common type of innovation in the public sector of Vietnam (54.5% of respondents in MPI and 60% of respondents in 3 provinces implementing process innovation), followed by product and service innovation. However, the percentage of respondents who said that their units have promulgated regulations on innovation is still low, indicating a lack of institutional support and guidance for innovation activities.

The report also reveals that public officials in Vietnam still lack the capacity to take risks and willingness to accept change/innovation. They also face financial difficulties and lack of information technology equipment and machinery for innovation.

Researcher such as Mariana Mazzucato has shown with evidences that the role of public sector has been crucial, contrary to popular belief, in enabling and funding technology such as Internet, GPS, its touch-screen display that eventually led to the creation of ground-breaking product such as the iPhone.

Some practitioners claim that entrepreneurial state bureaucracy is necessary to fuel national innovation ecosystem. One of the key insights that Accelerator Labs observed across the globe is that Innovations don’t just happen in shiny labs and Silicon Valley, we recognize that innovation, especially at grassroot, occurs all around us, in villages and farming communities. We believe that a more sustainable future is possible when the public sector goes beyond the Silicon Valley model, to create policies that systemically support people living closest to the problems create spontaneous, effective, sustainable solutions

UNDP is recognized there is a lack of skills, knowledge, tools, resources, incentives or collaboration among public officials at national provincial levels. At the same time, there has yet to exist a Criteria Framework for Measuring Innovation among public servants in Viet Nam.

There is also a lack of particular regulation and policy for innovation. The policy to promote national innovation ecosystem in Viet Nam is unsystematic and comprehensive, and biased towards innovation for start-ups, science and technology. Policies are dispersed in different aspects and are ran by different ministries, departments and sectors.

Another challenge is a lack of the view of the research team on innovation in the public sector to suit the political characteristics and identity of Asian countries since most of the international measurements of innovation in the public sector are from Western countries.

According to the World Bank, Vietnam has a low level of science, technology and innovation performance compared to other countries in the region. Citing the following weakness:

- Low levels of productivity and income.

- Inadequate framework conditions and disincentives for innovation.

- Limited access to finance for enterprises.

- Inefficiencies in state-owned enterprises.

- Infrastructure deficiencies.

- Weak performance of the teaching and learning system.

- Low level of sophistication of production and exports.

- Little innovation and even less research and development capacity in the business sector.

- Weak performance of public-sector research.

- Weaknesses in the S&amp;T infrastructure as regards laboratories and research equipment.

- Seriously underdeveloped information base for innovation policy making.

- Inadequate STI governance arrangements and policy implementation.

For this learning question, we are utilizing innovative data sources at the policy level to incorporate valuable youth voices, insights, critical thinking, and arguments into the public sector innovation playbook. Fulbright's talented students will actively participate and contribute, particularly during the conclusive Design Camp. This camp will serve as a platform to gather youth insights, propose practical solutions, and present compelling case studies, thereby enriching the playbook and enabling civil servants to finalize it with a youth-centric perspective. 

Existing data gaps when incorporating youth voices and critical thinking in policy recommendations for public sector innovation in Vietnam addresses limited youth participation and representation, inadequate understanding of nuanced youth needs, challenges in fostering collaboration between youth and policymakers and insufficiency in diverse critical analysis.
