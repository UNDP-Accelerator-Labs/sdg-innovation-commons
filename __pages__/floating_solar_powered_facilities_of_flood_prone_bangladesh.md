One fifth of Bangladesh floods annually during the monsoon season, but extreme floods cover up to two thirds, which are being exacerbated by climate change. In this context, Bangladeshi Architect Mohammed Rezwan came up with a creative solution ‘floating school’ to this problem. His organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha operates classroom on boat, a school that gives to the student when the student can't go to school.  The school-boat first serves as a school bus, making periodic stops to collect children from riverside stops. The boat then docks and class begins. In addition to a fleet of floating schools, the organization operates libraries, health clinics, playgrounds and floating training centres with wireless internet access, serving close to 122,000 people in flood-prone areas of Bangladesh. Sustainable agriculture: Floating training centers teach women and girls on new skills, sustainable agriculture, climate change adaptation, and women right.  Climate adaptation: The farmer's floating farming helps landless farmers to grow vegetables and raise fish and ducks on river, that secure the income, food and employment throughout the year. Healthcare: With doctor on board, the floating health clinic moves across the waterways and docking at a riverside village the boat provide medical checkups. These initiatives allow people to access education and information, develop new skills, grow flood resistant crops and adapt to climate change.
