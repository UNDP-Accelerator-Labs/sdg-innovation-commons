Turn Digital! 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Digital transformation of mSMEs was identified as a frontier challenge for Accelerator Lab in Azerbaijan. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Our challenge is that majority of mSMEs were hit by the pandemic and either stopped their operations fully or partially. Pandemic pushed mSMEs for the digital transformation while only 10% of the registered mSMEs in the country were the corporate website owners. Clearly, there is a  need to help mSMEs to move their business from offline to the online. Currently various government organization are trying to solve the problem by introducing different solutions however due to the complicated infrastructure and processes they lack flexibility and experimentation.

According to the Center for Analysis of Economic Reforms and Communication although the growth rate of e-commerce in the country in 2019 was high, its share in retail trade was only 0.2 percent.  The current level of Internet penetration, the share of e-commerce of Azerbaijani retailers can reach around 7 percent but not more.

According to the State Agency of Small and Medium Businesses they have observed growing number of registered legal entities and individual entrepreneurs. Despite the pandemic number of registered SMEs increased by 13%. Unfortunately there is no indication on weather these SMEs are involved in digital economy.  Still according to the Agency's report for 2020 the government understands and prioritizes the process of digital transformation although no clear strategy is in place. We observed reporting of sporadic events not only in the capital but also in the regions of the country devoted to digital economy. Also digital economy was included into the list of priorities of the Agency for 2021. These facts actually reflects the urgency of actions to be implemented towards the development of the solutions which will help in digital transformation of SMEs.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We work on the solution which will engage all actors and help SMEs to experience the full cycle of digital economy from the registration to the start of the operations. The idea is to create AI-based engine which will help SMEs to decide on their own pace of digital transformation therefore ensure the most smooth process of transformation. Considering the innovative idea of the solution and coordination among government partners, SMEs and innovators, and the AccLab's ability to partner with traditional partners, unusual suspects, ability to shift from one modality to another makes AccLab unique change-maker in this situation.
