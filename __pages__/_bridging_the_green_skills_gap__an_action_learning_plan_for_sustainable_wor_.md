"Bridging the Green Skills Gap: An Action Learning Plan for Sustainable Workforce Development in Serbia" (Green skills analysis)



## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the majority of workers in Serbia lack green skills, which are essential for transitioning to an environmentally sustainable economy. Specifically, only one in nine workers in Serbia has at least one green skill, and there are significant gender and age disparities in the acquisition of these skills.




> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The challenge of cultivating green skills in Serbia has been driven by the global need for an environmentally sustainable economic transition. The current situation reveals a significant gap in green skills among the workforce, with only 11.3% of workers possessing at least one green skill. This gap is further exacerbated by gender disparities, where men are more likely to have green skills than women, and by age disparities, with younger workers (18-24) having the lowest levels of green skills. The undesired effects include limited participation in green jobs, slower progress towards sustainability, and unequal opportunities for different demographic groups.

Underrepresentation of Younger Professionals:

The data reveals that the 18-24 age group shows the lowest numbers in green skill areas, indicating fewer opportunities or less experience in these fields for younger professionals. This underrepresentation suggests a need for more education and opportunities in green skills for the younger demographic.




Gender Disparities in Green Skills:

Despite women being 20% more likely to have skills related to sustainable development and the circular economy, they are underrepresented in the global workforce, particularly in renewable energy roles. In Serbia, women represent only 35.5% in renewable energy roles compared to 49% overall in all industries.




Skills Gap at Managerial Levels:

There is a noticeable decrease in green skills at the managerial level, indicating a potential skills gap at this level. This might reflect the natural pyramid structure of organizations or highlight an area where targeted upskilling is necessary.




Importance of Green Skills at Higher Leadership Levels:

The data suggests that green skills become more important again at higher levels of leadership (Director level), likely due to the strategic nature of sustainability and environmental considerations in business decision-making.




Gender Gap in Renewable Energy Roles:

Women are underrepresented in renewable energy roles, both globally and in Serbia. In Serbia, women represent only 35.5% in these roles, compared to 44% globally in other industries.




Emerging Trends in Sustainability-Focused Finance Skills:

Although data for Serbia was too small to measure certain green finance skills, there is a promising trend globally where workers are rapidly developing skills that bridge the finance and sustainability domains. This trend indicates a growing importance of sustainability-focused finance skills, even though it's nascent in Serbia.




Potential Green Skills Shortage:

The rapid increase in job postings requiring green skills (22.4% growth from 2022 to 2023) outpacing the increase in workers with green skills (12.3% growth) raises the prospect of an imminent green skills shortage.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The unique value proposition of our Accelerator Lab in addressing this challenge lies in our ability to leverage data-driven insights to identify and address skill gaps. Our focus on inclusive and equitable upskilling initiatives ensures that all segments of the workforce, regardless of gender or age, have the opportunity to acquire green skills. By investing resources in this challenge, we can drive a transformative shift towards a green economy, unlocking the full potential of the Serbian workforce.
