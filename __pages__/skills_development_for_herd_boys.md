## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Skills Development for Herd-boys 


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that even with the introduction of free formal primary education in Lesotho, the herd-boy

practice has continued, keeping this affected group out of school, hence negatively  impacting prospects of livelihood opportunities. Moreover, this exclusion affects  not only the boys’ livelihood but also their socialization as interaction with  society is limited. Herd boys are at high risk of exposure to criminal gangs

who have exploited the vulnerability of this cohort of children to lead them  towards engagement in criminal activities.

  



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



though herd boys rely on the environment for  their livelihood, they have not always been good stewards of the environment. It  is common for herd boys to burn pastural land with the aim of getting  better and greener grass quicker. These fires destroy the rich biodiversity of  the highlands, killing the natural habitats of wild animals and vegetation  reproduction process to produce seedlings. Burning pastures and  grazelands also contributes to serious environmental effects such as land  degradation and soil erosion into river systems and dams, hence reducing the land’s  productive capacity.  Land degradation is  also accelerated by overgrazing and poor rangeland management. Their very  actions are having a negative implication their livelihood

There  is an estimate of around  30,000 herd boys in Lesotho. The cultural practice  in the mountains and highlands of Lesotho has always been to use a male child  family member or to hire one to look after livestock, given rise to herd boys. According  to Commonwealth Education Partnerships (2007) , this practice is associated with  the tradition that wealth is measured in terms of the number of livestock a  family has. These cultural aspects make it difficult for some male child in rural areas to access education, social services, and proper health care. The life of a herd boy requires long stretches of time in the hills and mountains looking after the  flock as they graze and protecting the herd from wild animals. During this  time, the herd boys are away from their families with only other herd boys as company.

With a population of about two million, there are four ecological zones, namely the lowlands, foothills, mountains, and Senqu  River Valley. These zones differ in terms of topography, altitude, climate,

number of people and population concentration. The mountain ecological zone, although a larger land area, is characterized by harsh and long winters, cool and short summers. It is in the heart of the difficult ecological zones of the country that livestock ownership is high, and it is where the herd boys are

mostly found. A large fraction of this area hosts the cattle posts (motebo) where the herd boys spent months looking after livestock without going home.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



the AccLab intends to implement an experiment to provide crafts up-skilling and linkages to market for herd-boys to address a multifaceted and coherent approach to improve livelihoods; establish good relationship

between herd-boys and tourists; and contribute to alleviate social ills and improve overall human security. The experiment will aim to facilitate earning of livelihoods from crafts made of natural plants and will change herd-boys behaviour towards environment protection, thereby improving their co-existence with the ecosystem. This initiative has been inspired by the concepts of the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority’s Makhangoa community beneficiation and the South African Wow Zulu sustainable tourism models. 



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



The Lesotho AccLab is creating an ecosystem dependency to improve livelihoods,

human security and environmental protection among herd-boys

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



The hypothesis is that herd-boys will value the natural resources and see it not only as animal feed; but also as diversified livelihoods creation resource to be sustainably utilized. This will also reduce the uncontrolled burning of the pastures and encourage their protection.  They would also value both domestic and international tourists and see them as their market for the crafts



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The approach is based on robust stakeholder engagement to harvest more intelligence for co-creation and all encompassing community participation.



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Not enough data to provide evidence. Current information only based on knowledge.


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The community leadership structures will benefit more on the natural resources governance for livelihoods equality among males and females in Lesotho. The herd-boys will further gain more sustained livelihoods.
