> Anticipated Social Impact

I know what you’re thinking and I totally agree with you; maggots are very disgusting and the sight of them could easily make me vomit.

But to a chicken or fish, for example, maggots are a juicy treat.

Apart from its good taste, maggots are very nutritious and rich in proteins, a vital element in every animal feed. Proteins are important because they are a critical component in developing muscles in these animals which eventually become the meat that we humans eat.

Interestingly, maggots are hardly, if ever, used in animal feeds that are used by livestock farmers around the world.

For decades, proteins in animal feed have come from two main sources: Soybeans and Fishmeal. I’ll use the next paragraphs to take a quick look at these two protein sources and how important they are to the global animal feed industry.

Soybean is the major source of plant protein for animals. About 85 percent of the world’s soybean crop is processed into meal that is used in animal feed.

Only about two percent of the soybean meal is further processed into soy flours and proteins for human food use. The problem with soybean is that cultivating the crop requires a lot of land and water, and the intensive monoculture involved is creating adverse environmental impacts on our planet.

Worse still, as you will notice in the chart below, the price of soybean has risen sharply over the last decade.

This means that farmers have been paying a lot more to buy animal feed that contains sufficient protein (soybean) to grow their livestock to market size.


In recent years (2002 – 2014), the price of soybean has skyrocketed beyond all levels in history. 

 Fishmeal is the major source of animal-based protein for livestock. More than 20 percent of fish caught in the seas and oceans are crushed and processed into fish meal which is added as a protein provider in animal feeds.

This fishmeal is fed to pigs, cattle, poultry and farmed fish. Fishmeal has remained a popular ingredient in animal feed because of its high protein content (it actually contains more protein than soybean). image credit: tradeindia.com

The problem with fishmeal is that natural fish stocks in the oceans are reducing drastically across the world.

Due to overfishing and the negative effects of climate change, using our fish stocks as a source of raw materials for the animal feed industry is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.

If we continue to harvest fish from the seas and oceans at the current rate, we could run out of fish in less than 30 years. Evidence of this scarcity is already showing in the price of fishmeal on the international market. From 1999, the price of fishmeal rose from less than $500 per metric ton to over $2,000 in 2012. That’s a 500+% growth!

 
The steady rise of fishmeal from 1999 to 2014 has led to high animal feed costs for livestock farmers across the world (source: UndercurrentNews)

Maggots, unlike Soybean and Fishmeal, are very new to the scene as a suitable source of protein for animals. They are very rich in proteins and contain a wide range of amino acids and minerals that provide the necessary nutrition for livestock growth.

The best part is, producing insect-based protein (maggots) doesn’t come with the adverse environmental consequences of producing animal protein (fishmeal) and plant protein (soybean) which require more land, water and energy resources.

Unlike the prices of soybean and fishmeal which are currently going through the roof, maggots are abundant and readily available.

As long as you have organic waste, maggots can literally be ‘farmed’ in your backyard. This outcome will help farmers to save costs on animal feed while providing their pigs, poultry and fish with high-value protein.
