Since the beginning of time, most communities have dried most foods, including cassava, by exposing it to the sun, however, the weather is not conducive for this task all the time. When the weather is favorable, it takes no less than three days to properly dry the cassava, but when it rains, it takes much longer, and the risk for rotting is higher.  Mary Wanjiru has developed a machine that dries cassava faster to increase its shelf-life. Within six hours, the cassava chips are ready for frying, to be ground into flour. The machine is installed to a solar inter-charge that circulates hot air directly to a fixed bed carrying the product. It also consists of a controller, chipping plates, absorbing plates and front-end trays of wire mesh.
