## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

 Exploring why social impact businesses led by vulnerable group have limited access to investment
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that social impact businesses led by vulnerable groups do not have understanding of impact standards and ability to adopt this to attract private impact investors

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

From 2007-2017, only 10 private impact investors (PIIs) have deployed more than USD 25 million through 23 deals. The successful deals are quite limited in comparison with the demand to access the capital of social impact businesses (SIB). Additionally, it is even harder for SIBs led by vulnerable groups to access such capital sources. The current situation has not improved.




While the number of private impact investors are modest, the biggest challenge of SIBs is the shortage of capital, especially for SIBs led by vulnerable groups

Small social impact businesses in Vietnam get funding from non profit organisations, rather than venture capital. One of the reasons is they do not have a sound understanding of impact standards and how to adopt it to build an appropriate business model to attract investment. Brook Taylor, director of Vinacapital said that to strengthen the impact business model, effective business plans integrating both impact and profit is vital. Investors will then consider investing. Standards and specific measurement tools may be a solution for small social impact businesses to improve current business models to be more impactful and effective.
