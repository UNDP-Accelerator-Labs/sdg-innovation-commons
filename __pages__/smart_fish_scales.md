"It is an IoT scale that takes pictures on every fish and through image processing and artificial intelligence analyzes the metrics (i.e. weight and dimensions) on every fish. This data is sent to the cloud and matched to the fisherman, the boat and the fishing path. All this information is then printed in tags to start the traceability certification."
