> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation is a flushable toilet that is controlled and/or operated automatically. For the system to work there must be enough water in the cistern and enough sanitizing chemical. The user selects one of the two modes of operation either stool or urine mode by stepping on foot sensor. Immediately the system checks if there is enough water for the respective mode, if true the system sanitizes the seat and then the lid opens. Once the user leaves the seat, a weight sensor detects no weight which triggers the lid to close and only the appropriate amount of water containing biodegradable in cistern is pushed to flush the waste in the bowl.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation is going to generate income in the following ways:
1. To the existing ordinary toilets only modified lid need to be bought and fixed with its related components at a reasonable fee.
2. A small maintenance fee may be charged to customers for improvements of the systems.
3. Enter into partnership for instance with the local councils so as to maintain and account for their public toilet uses as the toilets can be monitored by connecting them to council network on their usage thereby accounting for every coin. 
4. Construction of a whole new toilet system using fiber glass, this requires partnership with others specialized in fiber glass. This means reducing on importing toilets they can be manufactured locally and cheaply hence creating employment to many.
5. This innovation lowers cost on monthly utility bills for both public and household users e.g hospitals, markets, homes, even offices etc
6. The value addition on the environment is that there is efficient use of water for instance only appropriate amount of water is used to flush stool or urine this in tern reduces stress on water utility companies.
7. The challenge prize will help to actualize this innovation by starting a small enterprise.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed and implemented using an Arduino and some IOT components. The system has three parts which include the physical toilet, IOT and/or electronic components and software.
The physical parts are linked with the electronic components such as motors, sensors etc and software is used to control them all.
There are two foot operated sensors for selecting the mode either stool or urine and send signal to Arduino.
The Arduino interprets and requests the sensor on the cistern to read and send the amount of water in cistern, amount of sanitizer and amount of biodegradable.
The Arduino then instructs the sanitizing motor to sanitize the seat by spraying and rubbing the seat surface if all is true otherwise a light glows together with alarm indicating to the user that no enough water.
Once the sanitizing is done, Arduino instructs the lid motor to open the lid and the person can now use the toilet.
When the person has finished and stands up, weight sensor on the seat sends a signal to the Arduino which tells the lid motor to close then the flush motor releases water to flush the waste in the bowl.

A physical working prototype has been created as shown in the pictures above.
The proposed implementation for now is using IOT devices such as Arduinos.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve the lives of people by ensuring that there is cost serving on water and sanitation utility bills, reducing on infectious diseases from toilet seats, handles and the like. It also offers development of local talent and skill to manufacture toilet systems locally at cheaper and affordable cost. 
Because this is local product it means more revenue to the government and employment opportunities.
