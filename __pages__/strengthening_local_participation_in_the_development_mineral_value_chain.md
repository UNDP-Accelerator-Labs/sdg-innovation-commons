## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

     The registration of mining/ mining processing activities as Cooperatives/ Firms is key for the Small-Scale Miners through business registration or through forming cooperatives to tap into benefits of formalization such as Mining Rights granted by a mining license, access to credit and recognition in the sector allowing the cooperatives/ registered firms to have bargaining power on the price of their commodities. It was observed where cooperatives were not formed, miners were termed illegal and paid costs such as trespassing fees to landowners and had lower bargaining power on the price of their commodities particularly with the transporters.

2. Access to extraction equipment was one of the key barriers to growth of the small-scale miners even where the mining practice was formalized, most miners did require machinery to aid in the extraction of material, processing of material (i.e., crushing, tumbling, grading, sorting)

3.Most mining sites had low participation of women with the exception of the Ngwenya Mining site that had a high participation of women in the crushing of stones. The artisans did highlight the need to improve their productivity by using equipment that can improve their output and their working conditions by being less prone to occupational accidents

4. Another barrier to market was the non-standardization of extracted minerals. As most of their customers had a certain specification, for example, clean material of a certain size, the Cooperatives did express this as one of the points that reduces the price of their commodities as they are using hammers, picks and shovels to mine, they are not able to meet the specifications of their customers. The Miners also did not have access to machinery that could help them in washing, sieving, crushing the minerals causing significant time lags in their production timelines

5. While innovators have interesting and strong ideas, practical evidence to back their designs and working prototypes, the costs of production and upkeep currently sits out of the financial capacity of the miners and their cooperatives. Further mining for innovations that can be reasonably accessed and used by the miners may be beneficial

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes it was very unique sector with low participation and very high impacts on the countries construction and industrial sector of the country. Mainly infrastructural challenges such as lack of roads to reach certain areas. As most of the ASMs were not formalized (making them illegal miners) this presented challenges on how to collaborate with them.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Although official statistics and isolated research projects have documented the state of the ASMs in Development minerals there exists a gap of information on the challenges and driving issues, production, adoption and use of locally produced mining equipment targeted to enhance production capacity. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective intelligence was applied to garner an understanding of the issues in the sector from the various players in the ecosystem. We have been able to select entry points that need further exploration to find suitable solutions that need to be tested in collaboration with the ASMs. Through Sensemaking activities and Collective Intelligence workshops ecosystmen players were able to design the innovation challenge based on issues mapped.
