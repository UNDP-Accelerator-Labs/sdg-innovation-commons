Innovator: Okeanos Vanuatu

This ship is the first cargo vessel in Vanuatu that operates on sustainable energy. Twice a week, depending on the demand, the Vaka arrives at several islands of the Shepherd Group, with a typical route seeing the Vaka stop in Mataso, Makura, Émaé, Tongariki, Buninga and Tongoa before returning back to Port Vila, usually arriving back by midnight the following day. It is servicing these unfrequented islands using renewable energy for propulsion and mitigating CO2 emissions.
