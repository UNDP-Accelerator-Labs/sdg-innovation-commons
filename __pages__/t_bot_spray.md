T-Bot Spray is a robotic vehicle controlled through the Internet of Things (IoT) for the purpose of pesticide spraying in agricultural lands, particularly in oil palm plantations. 
 
Its objectives:
1. to reduce dependence on human workforce
2. to reduce risk of exposure to toxic pesticide that endanger human health
3. to reduce maintenance cost of plantation

Its software: 
T-Bot Spray uses LiDAR technology to recognise and evade barriers. It can be remotely controlled through the use of smartphones or laptops within a radius of 400m that is connected to the Wifi. A high pressure pump and wide spout enable the user to spray the pesticide over a large area. The robot is designed to take into account of operational services; its modular design allows for easy repair and replacement of main components, while its electronic components can be accessed via a sliding mechanism underneath the vehicle.
