> Title of the innovation

Making our town and markets healthy and clean.

> Brief description of the innovation

Growing up in Mufulira district, I have noticed that some parts of the markets and town are made as dump sites in my district and that has made my team and I to come up with an idea to help in keeping our areas( markets, towns and other public places) clean and healthy.
This problem of having dumping sites in parts of town and markets in not just in Mufulira but all around Zambia.
It is safe to say that the city councils have failed to do a good job when it comes to keeping these surroundings clean and healthy. Hence my team and I want to help( do the job). We plan on distributing rubbish bins all around town and markets so that people, marketeers and other business owners in towns could have places to dump there dirt. We plan on picking up the dirt 2 or three times a week to keep the environment clean and safe. You

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Marketeers, bus and taxi drivers, and other business owners in towns pay some amount of money to the city council everyday. This money is used for cleaning the drainage system in towns, maintenance of some properties, paying some of there workers and picking up the garbage(the council have failed to keep the environment clean and healthy at full capacity). The council is suppose to pay us under a contract since a part of the money they collect from marketeers and other stake holders also include a percentage of money which should be used in keeping the environment clean and healthy. 
We will also be teaching people on how to keep the environment clean and healthy and telling them the advantages of doing that.
This initiative will help keep our communities and public places clean, healthy and safe.

> Technical Feasibility

We will distribute dozens of rubbish bins in town and markets. This will help in the sense that people will see places were they can throw there dirt without causing harm to the environment.
We should then have a dump truck or higher one so that we can be picking up garbage from town and markets to dump sites twice every week.
We need to employ at least five for a start. One should be a driver and the raining four should be picking up the gabage.
Our employees will need proper clothing's to keep them safe from germs which may cause diseases.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the lives of our employees in the sense that they will be able to sustain there families and lives with a salary.
It will also improve lives of all those found I'm markets and towns since the environment will be kept clean and healthy.
