If you are looking for a solution to control your electricity consumption and, in turn, lower your bill at the end of the month, this is indeed a device that will please you. it is a circuit assembly designed to adapt switching on and off by means of an SMS which you can send from any point on earth. Let's say it's an executor of will dictated through the short messaging system ....... For the moment this solution is in full swing and could well be available very soon on the market. This is also designed by the team of IST of Mamou.
