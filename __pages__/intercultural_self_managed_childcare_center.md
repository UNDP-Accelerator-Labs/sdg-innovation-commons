This autonomous childcare center in the heart of Quito´s San Roque Market was created to address some barriers to access posed by conventional care services. Another municipal public childcare center is right next to this one; however, the list of school supplies, uniform, strict schedules and other requirements are often a burden for the market mothers whose work hours go beyond 9 to 5. On the contrary, the autonomous childcare center is self-managed and provides bilingual education to promote the conservation of the indigenous language and identity in an urban context. This experimental center is run by parents and educators and guarantees an intercultural service, adapted to the times and needs of the market’s working women.


While the official care center, for some mothers, is seen as place where their children will blend into mainstream mestizo culture, cut their indigenous braids and adopt city clothing, others do not want to give up to their indigenous identity.
