## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The five keys learning are the followings:  

1- The legal and institutional ecosystem on waste collection subscription is scattered and potentially confrontational between involved institutions 

2- Potential subscribers (households) are perceiving subscription as an abuse. 

3- Subscription fees are high compare to households revenues 

4- The municipality has not the necessary means to enforce Law concerning household subscription to waste collection 

5- Payment system is still dominated by hand to hand option.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Mainly, bringing together stakeholders is a challenge by itself. Moreover, some political constraints and money management involvements make discussion tight and difficults. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The issue of data is a big challenge in Guinea. Official and secondary data available are not actual. By using citizen participation, surveys and Youth engagement we have been able to collecte day to day data. Ethnographic data help us to make cultural differences regarding the relation to waste collection subscription as well as gathering financials information on the issue

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Crowdsourcing allow us to collect data quickly and in a accurate way. Thinking the system lead us to must of the gaps identified 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have not been able to mobilize formal civil society organization on the matter, as most of those whe contacted were expecting  financial rewards, which we cannot afford. Instead we had the opportunity to ourself built a national network of young volunteers that help us realize engagement with local youth. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with one public university and one national institut specialized in social sciences

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We had the opportunity to interact with waste collection SME registered to the ratoma's municipality data base. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The municipality of Ratoma, our area of focus

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Universities and the Municipality of Ratoma are unusual partners for UNDP. Theses institutions are special because the allow us to have the local and political point of view as well as a scientific approach. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We started reflecting with UNCDF. We are discussing about how best can we think on a financial system of waste collection subscription. Discussions are still ongoing
