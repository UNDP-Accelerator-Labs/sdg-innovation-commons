It is made from coconut sap, coconut syrup replaced raw sugar. Due to its thick texture, syrup is used only half the amount of normal sugar in the recipe. Made from traditional skills well known in the Northern Pacific, it is believed this is a much healthier option to sugar in the islands struggling with NCDs and can be a great product from the Pacific, a healthier gift to the world.
