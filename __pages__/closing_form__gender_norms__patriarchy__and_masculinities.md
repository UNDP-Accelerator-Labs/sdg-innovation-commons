## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. It's extremely important to focus on local solution holders and shape UNDP's work based on what we find locally.  2.  Behaviors that emerge from deeply embedded in social and cultural convictions cannot be changed through a nudge alone.  Nudges are a helpful behavioral change tool but they are just one tool and best used alongside other interventions  three. Important to be very careful about how you design your measure of "success" for an experiment. We are not sure if setting up the online Twitter campaign experiment success to be based on the number of relevant tweets before and after the campaign was the most useful design, partly because it was only a quantitative measure.  4. Better to do smaller, shorter experiments that require a small budget before spending a lot of energy and time on a big bet experiment.  5.Using public tweets as the main insight of the public to design an online behavioral change experiment is not sufficient. More needs to be done to get insights from people as part of the research and to involve the public in the design of behavioral experiments.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. We faced:  -cultural and social barriers in changing behaviors related to gender roles.  -operational barriers within UNDP -not being able to use the CO Twitter account because the review and approval process for content takes too long and would have not allowed us to tweet at the frequency we needed to for the experiment. -the lockdown during the early days of COVID made it impossible to do fieldwork as a method of sensemaking and exploration -working with consultants that were not based in Jordan and did not have sufficient understanding of the local context made the work more difficult. -slow contractual processes delayed getting support to make the experiment happen

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used behavioral insights because the CO had not done any behavioral research on the topic of gender norms and roles. We used social network/media data because we decided early on to do the research and experiment online due to COVID lockdown measures. NOTE: behavioral nudge messaging is actually an innovation method not a  type of data but added it here because I wasn't able to add it in the next question.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used positive deviance in the early stages of mapping behaviors and changes that were emerging during the lockdown. One of these was the increase in men participating in unpaid care work at home. Social media and social network analysis were used to understand the trends around content related to unpaid care work and masculinities on Twitter. This was necessary since we were unable to do any field work so this was our only source of data. Finally, we used behavioral nudge messaging because this was the most suitable for Twitter as our platform for research and experimentation.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In the Twitter campaign, none. Now in a new phase working with Society for Aid, Improvement, and Bridging (SAIB)  on behavioral change using environmental psychology to do spatial interventions at a household level in Gaza Refugee Camp.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Nudge Lebanon -https://nudgelebanon.org/. They did the behavioral and social media research and analysis.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Nudge Lebanon as the first behavioral insights expert we partnered with at the Jordan CO. SAIB as the only local organization we know of that uses environmental psychology and works on behavior change through spatial design. Both are new partners for UNDP.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Gender specialists at the Jordan CO and RBAS  - provided insights throughout the process. TMx2 -Targeting Men, Transforming Masculinities -an initiative from HQ gender team who provided support through a masculinities expert as a consultant.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This combination allowed us to try something new that otherwise would not have happened within CO projects. It also gave us the space to test, fail, re-orient, and try again.
