> Brief description of the innovation

Well my main aim about this business is to make sure that I make  profit and earn a living as a responsible citizen in a kind and good manner. I also know that by so doing am applying my academic knowledge as I was a taking business subjects (principals of accounts and commerce). I also want to know more about business and how to interact and  cooperate in a business world. It also makes me to feel alive by doing something productive rather doing nothing. I know its not easy cause challenges has to be faced, but am ready to face the challenges though am new in this business industry. Nothing is easy in this world so if you want to live a bright and happy life you have to be strong, no matter how little the profit is. "They say suffer now and enjoy later".
I always remember that this life, its about me. No one can make a future for me if I don't do it myself.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This business will generate income in many ways. Its just depends on how you advertise your products, and goods. Also on how u price, associate with your customers and how strict you are. I advertise through social media specifically WhatsApp and Facebook. Sometimes I usually attack my contacts each and every time I buy new products and tell them about it and give them much information about it. I also deliverer goods to my customers if orders are made to reduced transport expense especially those who are within my town.

> Technical Feasibility

To give people quality goods and make it easy for them to buy goods within and avoiding spending too much money, e.g transportation etc.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is beneficial to other people because when buying I give them information and advice on the quality of good I have , in this case customers become aware about what they are buying. I tell them about the new and latest fashion on the market.
And offer credit service to trusted customers and also gives discount at some point.
