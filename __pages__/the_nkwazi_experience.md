> Title of the innovation

The Nkwazi Experience

> Brief description of the innovation

The Nkwazi Experience is a Zambian travel reality show that showcases the Southern African tourism landscape through the journeys of a travel magazine photographer, a travel writer and a travel planner. This tourism product is designed for television and internet streaming platforms in order to entertain and educate viewers on the various travel and cultural destinations within the borders of Zambia. The show is adapted from Nkwazi Magazine’s “Experience” section/articles which Benny Blow (writer) and Lizu (photographer) have been contributing to for over three years. Added to that is a segment with travel tips from Chipema the Travel Planner, who goes into in-depth travel tips that seek to harness a travel culture by giving viewers knowledge and tools to make what they see on the show become a reality for themselves. The show also brings together a host of other players in the Tourism sphere all the while telling real stories of nature, conservation, heritage, wildlife, safari and travel.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target consumers for this product are 21 - 50 year old middle to high income earning Zambian residents. These, however, are not our customers. The Nkwazi Travel Experience will be targeted at Broadcasting Networks/Corporations and Channels. Examples include Multi Choice, Diamond TV, Muvi TV, QTV, Life TV, and the Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). So ours is a B2B2C business model. We create a product that other businesses/organizations use to generate revenue. Although our primary revenue stream will be sales to a broadcasting company, the potential for up scaling its sales are huge. We would look to breach the international market by selling this product to internationally acclaimed travel and destination channels such as Discovery (Travel Channel) and BBC (The Travel Show). Creating more traffic in the domestic tourism sphere increases revenue for tourism operators and thus grows the industry. The Nkwazi Experience will also deliberately tell stories around conservation to raise awareness and grow an appetite within the local population for sustainable natural resource management. The challenge prize will facilitate the production of Season 1 of the The Nkwazi Experience Show. The earnings from this production will propel the production of further seasons and tourism production opportunities.

> Technical Feasibility

The Nkwazi Experience reality show is a unique edutainment product owing to the fact that there is currently no local travel related programming options for television viewers and very few existing online. Most reality television series have themes related to comedy and romance. Our industry experience over the past decade has helped us establish a vast network of contacts in tourism, culture and conservation from which we create interesting and interactive content for our viewers. Each show has an interactive storyline that motivates the viewers to seek to experience what the show participants are experiencing. A season will comprise 13 episodes that have a run time of 20 minutes each. A full season from Pre to Post Production is scheduled to take up to 4 months.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a crippling effect on the tourism industry. As the pandemic weans it’s imperative for the industry that there also be an increased demand in travel and holiday making. Thus, there is a heightened desire and effort by holiday destinations and tourism service providers to advertise their businesses. The Nkwazi Experience is designed to encourage more locals to travel to help boost the tourism industry. Local tourism is a resource that has not been fully realized in Zambia despite the plethora of tourism resources the country hosts. This is due to many factors, a key one being that the local citizenry have not effectively taken ownership of these resources and there exists a subconscious understanding that tourism is for foreigners. Additionally, there is a notion that the conservation of the environment, wildlife, history and heritage are a preserve of foreigners and not the local population. Such notions are further exacerbated when media productions of travel and tourism more commonly use images of foreigners when being shown to our local audiences. Our product seeks to change the narrative that tourism is only for foreigners by telling domestic tourism stories through the experiences of the local people.
