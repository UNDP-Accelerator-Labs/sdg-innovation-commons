Their work focuses on the documentation of traditional knowledge in Sarawak. SBC, together with local communities have discovered the commercial potential of local herbs (Adenosma nelsonioides) during their traditional knowledge documentation program with the Bidayuh and Iban communities. The opportunities to transfer traditional knowledge into research, product development and commercialization will promote benefit-sharing between entrepreneurs and the local community. Solutions: Supply of plant materials and oil production  The discovery of the plant species Adenosma nelsonioides which possess anti-bacterial properties as well as fragrant smell sees an opportunity to develop essential oil products, hygiene products and natural repellency.  Efforts by SBC to supply plant materials and in production of oil have allowed the community to plant, harvest and distill the essential oil by themself.  The project also empowers women farmers as they learn new skills and get extra income from providing the raw resources to SBC.  Following the discovery and production, the intellectual property of this plant has been filed for protection, empowering the community to have a strong ownership towards their biological resources.  Community empowerment Co-operative establishment to manage community funds.
