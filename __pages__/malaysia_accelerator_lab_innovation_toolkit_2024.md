## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1- Horizon scanning is a systematic, ongoing process that goes beyond mainstream news to identify "weak signals" and interconnected drivers of change.  It is possible to “merakyatkan foresight” (make the foresight process and jargon relatable to everyday people)

2- Launching small-scale pilots allows for real-world testing, feedback collection, and rapid refinement. It does not have to start with a project, the way we design a workshop is a good entry point for design thinking

3- Inclusive community workshops, causal layered analysis (CLA), and co-creation processes empower diverse voices, ensuring horizontal scanning insights are grounded in the realities of stakeholders like indigenous communities and youths​


> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Handover to CO MY colleagues through a brownbag and this toolkit in hardcopies and softcopies

> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The Innovation Toolkit (Accelerator Lab Malaysia 2024) redefines horizon scanning as a systematic, ongoing process rather than a one-time exercise, addressing widespread misconceptions about foresight. It emphasizes gathering weak signals and exploring multiple possible futures to develop proactive, adaptive strategies.

A groundbreaking feature is its integration of multiple data sources, combining conventional datasets like government statistics with unconventional ones, such as citizen-generated social media data and geospatial. This comprehensive approach ensures richer, more inclusive insights.

The toolkit also pioneers a cost-efficient horizon scanning system, leveraging accessible tools while minimizing reliance on costly infrastructure. Lessons learnt in engaging diverse stakeholders in Malaysia’s context ensures outputs are credible, context-specific, and grounded in real-world challenges.

By blending innovation with inclusivity and practicality, this approach sets a new standard for UNDP Malaysia, positioning it as  as a development leader of choice,  that knows the best way of policy advisory and solutions testing for sustainable development.
