Currently farmers in Bangladesh use guesswork when it comes to growing crops and have limited knowledge on soil conditioning for maximum output. This soil testing kit analyzes soil samples instantly indicating the pH, sodium, phosphorus and potassium in reference to color code provided on the device. The device also has an accompanying android mobile app which analyzes the kit with mobile camera and based on the analyzed results provides fertilizer recommendations to obtain optimal level of soil elements. This helps the farmers to make an informed decision regarding whether the soil needs to be conditioned with a certain level of balanced elements.
