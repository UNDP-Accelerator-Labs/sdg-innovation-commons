> Brief description of the innovation

During  the farming season  which is between  September and April, zambia produces  a lot of healthy and sweet mangoes especially in villages which just goes to waste because most local people  are just  not interested in  learning how they can make the most of the mango while  others just lack a skill but others just don't have the needed  equipment  required to  blend and preserve the finished product.i identified Eastern province of zambia  produces so many mangoes so my plan is to make connections with different local people from eastern  province  to be supplying  me with fresh mangoes.
