Overall goal: Analyze the environmental dynamics of coasts in the province of Buenos Aires - Create a solid database that is sustained over time in which local stakeholders participate and play a major role in different complex issues, such as erosion, sedimentation, storm effects, and landscape changes.  Specific goals: Implement an environmental data monitoring system that is continuous and sustained over time throughout the coast of the province of Buenos Aires - Analyze the impact of extreme weather events, its year-over-year and seasonal variation and tendency on beaches of the province of Buenos Aires  - Based on citizen participation, create a database of socio-environmental dynamics in each study town  - Establish coastal erosion risk levels due to natural and anthropic actions - Strengthen the links among research institutions, civil society organizations, and decision-makers. 

Description of citizen participation: Citizen participation starts by defining the coastal area to be measured based on the social or environmental issues citizens note or perceive on their own. After the area is defined, participants collect data every month (type of breaker, wave height and period, longshore drift speed and direction, sediment size, and beach profile) using measurement techniques learned in previous training sessions. Finally, the collected data is sent digitally to the project’s email.  After a storm, data is also sent with photos and/or videos and pre-designed forms completed with citizens’ perceptions of the storm’s effects on their towns.  In June 2024, the project plans to organize participatory workshops in which citizens will be encouraged to think about possible solutions for the perceived issues and whether it is attainable to carry out some of them, for example, the decision and implementation of garbage bins.
