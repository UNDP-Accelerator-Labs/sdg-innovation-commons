## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



We have learned that:
-Grassroot innovations can have a real impact on day-to-day activities, as is the case with solar-powered mobile kiosks for young people;
- Innovative prototypes such as these mobile kiosks are more attractive to another category of customer, namely young people (girls/boys);
- The inclusion of a lighting system allow street youths to also sell at night, when the business is even more profitable; 
-We need to find ways of reducing the cost of manufacture, for example by making several parts (economies of scale).   

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



The transfer process is still ongoing, as we are in the process of carrying out more in-depth tests. 

> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



The direct interviews, engagement with youth and questionnaires enabled us to find out exactly how the problem of conservation of perishable products of small street businesses running by street youths and women. Geospatial data enabled us to better plan and monitor the areas covered during surveys. 


> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



With co-creation approach and design thinking, we developed with the engineers, 02 prototypes to be test.
