The solution is to reduce the damage of the devastating effects of climate change on nutrition and to raise awareness on this issue, especially in emergencies and disasters; It aims to develop techniques and studies that can be used for "Sustainable Nutrition" and "Nutrition Improvement", to develop theoretical arguments by establishing interdisciplinary bridges with gastronomy and to take part in field practices.
