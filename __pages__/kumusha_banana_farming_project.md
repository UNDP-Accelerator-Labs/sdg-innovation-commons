> Brief description of the innovation

The Kumusha Banana Farming project  will be located Chirundu District in Lusaka Zambia. The farm is in a startup stage. The project innovator has secured land along the Zambezi river. The project will grow Bananas  on a commercial scale. The project will empower the local community through creation of employment and skills training thereby contribute positively to the development of the economy. 
The  project will also adopt environmentally friendly farming practices there help in conservation of the soil and aquatic life.
Since Bananas are highly nutritious, the project will have a direct impact in improving the health of the people of Chirundu and the nation at large.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Bananas are highly profitable business with a relatively low cost of production compared to other crop.

The Bananas will be grown in an area with abundant water resources. The area lies along the Zambezi River. The project will make use of irrigation system to pump water straight from the river. This will help minimise the cost of production and maximise on profit from the project
The project will make use of manpower from the local community.
The workers will receive a stipend to enable them carry out their work effectively and at the end they will receive a salary / payment for the work done.
The target market will be food processing companies, shopping malls and the local community.

The challenge prize will help the business grow by helping in the smooth operation of the project, securing /acquisition of a market share and development of a brand of high quality bananas and help in the development of bananas processing plant over the long term which will reduce the on the waiting period for the bananas to be sold since there shelf life vis short.
The project will adopt climate smart farming methods such as avoidance of use of herbicides. Cutting down on herbicide use also will reduce agricultural runoff in local rivers thereby helping conservation aquatic life and reduce on soil degradation.

> Technical Feasibility

The project has already secured the land in chirundu area. The land is along the Zambezi River which will make irrigation easy. The  project will require funding for the water pump, fertilizer, suckers/seedlings,  to plant and to pay the workers that will help in cultivation and day to day operations of the farm. 
The project will make use of local manpower to carry out its day to day operations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project will have a direct impact on the lives of the local community and it will serve as a base for skills development
 It will contribute to economic development  by creating employment  for the people of chiawa which will in turn contribute to poverty reduction.
Since bananas are a rich source of nutrients, the project will contribute to improve d health for the people of chiawa and the nation at large.
worker well-being and the health of soil, nearby forests, and rivers are considered very essential to the long-term sustainability of the farm. 

The project will adopt climate smart farming methods such as avoidance of using herbicides. Cutting down on herbicide use also will reduce agricultural runoff in local rivers thereby helping conservation aquatic life. Also this will boost the productivity and longevity of banana plants, thereby reducing farm operating costs
