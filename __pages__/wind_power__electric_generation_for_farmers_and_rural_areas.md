> Title of the innovation

Wind power  electric generation for farmers and rural areas

> Brief description of the innovation

Generating clean energy from wind that can be used in small scale farms and rural areas at a cheaper cost compared to other sources of energy

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Currently we have a challenge in terms of  city electricity as the demand is too high. Most small scale farmers are unable to effectively run their business due to luck of electricity. Giving the small scale farmers an alternative which is less expensive can boost their production, it will in turn will draw down to an average citizen. Food will be cheaper and a number and production will be increased.

Sell and install the windmills and partnering with agro businesses who will in turn dicerminate information to the farmers

The wind mill generates clean energy that will not negatively affect the environment.

 We shall be able to build a demo site to show customers how it will benefit them physically.

> Technical Feasibility

We shall be ordering some windmillers then we connect them to the battery that will be storing power .

> Anticipated Social Impact

We shall be able to employ youths thereby reducing poverty and at the same time providing enough food
