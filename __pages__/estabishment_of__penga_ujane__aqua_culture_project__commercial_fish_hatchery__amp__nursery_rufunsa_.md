ESTABISHMENT OF  PENGA UJANE  AQUA-CULTURE PROJECT  COMMERCIAL FISH HATCHERY &amp; NURSERY RUFUNSA  ZAMBIA A FISH FARMING PROJECT IN RUFUNSA  LUSAKA PROVINCE

> Brief description of the innovation

PROPOSED BUSINESS MODEL PHASES: FISH HATCHERY &amp; NURSERY, AND WHOLE FISH PRODUCTION

Penga Ujane is a traditional farm dwelling situated approximately 12 kilometres from the Great East Road, along the gravel trunk road that leads to Lower Zambezi. This trunk road deviates to the right slightly at the Sinjela TseTse Control. The farm is in the same locality as Rufunsa Girls Technical School, approximately 2 kilometres after the school. Rufunsa district has an estimated population of 45,000, mainly peasant farmers, and hunters.

MODEL PHASE ONE: FISH HATCHERY AND NURSERY 
The hatchery and nursery model component will be designed to produce close to 2.7 million fingerlings annually for sale to smaller fish farmers. The model hatchery and nursery model will occupy a total surface area of two hectares comprising three main sections; 
	The water reservoir, and supply part;
	The indoor unit, 
	The broodstock and grow-out ponds

MODEL PHASE TWO: WHOLE FISH PRODUCTION
The second expansion phase will involve whole fish production as the second principal products of the proposed farm, mainly for the local community market consumption, and fish traders mainly out of Rufunsa. The second phase will involve producing packaged branded fish Fillets for sale in supermarkets

Project will have a total of 45 staff, 4 management personnel, 7 technical experts and 34 general workers.

Generic whole fish, sold to local community, fish traders, and large bulk buyers. 

Fish fillets. Prepared for upper markets, and supermarkets, packed in branded as (Rufunsa Tilapia) in 1.0 kg, in 0.5, 5.0 and 10.0 kg capacity plastic packages.

Gutted tilapia. Clean gutted fish will be packed in branded fish boxes, branded Rufunsa Tilapia, and made ready for supermarkets.

Non – Product Outputs (NPOs), byproducts of gutting and filleting, sun dried, processed and recycled as feed for poultry. 
 
Environment damage will be minimized by establishing aquaculture facility as a separate system isolated from streams, using non-harmful techniques such as fencing, mechanical deterrents and watchmen. Drained pond water into agricultural land usage.

> Technical Feasibility

Hatchery and nursery model component will be designed to produce close to 2.7 million fingerlings occupying a total surface area of two hectares of three main sections
Water reservoir/supply
Water supply from borehole system with stable flow rates into the fish farm with maximum water volume requirement approximately 72 m3, with total requirement at 134 m3. Approximately 260 m3 per day for the ponds daily. 
Indoor unit
A 252 m2 (length 18 m and width 14m) building will be constructed for indoor facilities, comprising four main units.
Broodstock  
Holding structure with 32 cylindrical plastic containers of 80 litres each, for holding one female each after injection for final ripening of the ovules as well as for post incubation observation period. 
Fertilized eggs will be transferred to incubation unit made up of twelve cylindrical plastic containers, 60 litres each. Each incubator will contain132g of eggs, a total of 780,000 eggs. Hatching rate is 90%.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Local Employment Opportunities
Facility will create job opportunities for a total of 45 skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled personnel. 
Suppliers 
Indirectly, suppliers of fish feed, fingerlings, stationery, logistics, legal, accounting and auditing services, and ITCs.
National Income Envelope
Aquaculture as a lucrative business both to the investor and government is obvious, will bring about significant amount of income through taxation and generation of foreign currency.
Genetic Resources Preservation
Demand fish for human consumption expands, leads to negative exploits of natural fish stock populations of locally endemic and threatened species of fish, and the effect of such disturbance of the system through overfishing, preservation of exotic species can be difficult to manage. Penga Ujane Aquaculture shall contribute to minimize such risks, while sustaining supply of quality fish. 
Nutritional Food Security
Fish is demanded for its high nutritional value contains proteins, vitamins, minerals good for children, pregnant women. Communities such as Rufunsa have poor access to fish, especially in the case of communities living in areas very far from rivers, and lakes.
Research/Knowledge Transfer
Any commercial level aquaculture facility shall incorporate research as a component, good theoretical lessons at different institutions of higher learning, this can be supplemented with matching practical experiences.
