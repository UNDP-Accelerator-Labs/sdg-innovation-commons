## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.    The majority of solutions related to waste recovery, the most often cited being beach clean-ups and other citizen-driven actions. This identified a gap regarding marine waste where we need to develop and support solutions at the beginning of the waste chains, for example with biodegradable packaging or behaviour change regarding the use and disposal of plastics. Renewable energy and aquaculture solutions were also lower than expected, highlighting the opportunity to develop these sectors in the country;

2.    63 entrepreneurs were identified and registered for the challenge, with only 19 providing data on their scaling needs. Of the 19, 42% indicated the need for grant funding and 21% for seed funding, while non-extractive financing, traditional finance, and venture capital were sighted 10% each. Across the 19 core participants, there was a need for ZAR 17 million (approx. USD 1 million) in resource mobilisation in order to scale.

3.    Looking at the impact across the SDG14 targets, the three targets with the most contribution included, 1. reducing marine pollution; 2. Protecting and restoring ecosystems; 3. Conserve Coastal and Marine Areas. This provides lessons on solution areas that require early-stage support in order to reach all SDG14 targets.

4.    37% of businesses were black-owned, and 47% had no female ownership, again identifying categories for future support to enhance equality in this sector.

5.    As we did not have sufficient funds to provide for enterprise development or scaling support, we developed relationships with two private sector commercial aquaculture farms who have agreed to collaborate with the selected innovators, allowing them access to their infrastructure, labs, and expertise to pilot and test their solutions within these farms. This lesson is going to allow us to build a model for private sector support for innovations scaling, as well as provide ‘loop holes’ for Intellectual Property ownership.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The Ocean Economy is an underdeveloped sector, and the ecosystem of actors is highly fragmented with little to no coordination and collaboration across businesses and interventions.

There is a lack of trust for government in the sector, with feedback from participants including that many promises have been made over the last few years with no actual implementation or action.

Due to this lack of trust in government and other development programming, we had to do extensive work on direct recruiting (identifying and reaching out directly to entrepreneurs and innovators) in order convince actors to join the challenge and community of practice. This provided lessons for the implementation modalities for future innovation challenges in undeveloped sectors.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

With the ocean economy being an underdeveloped and fragmented sector, we needed to draw on desktop reviews, social media posts, ecosystem mapping, and relationship development to identify innovators and solutions. We also included data from existing enterprises to provide information on the status of the ecosystem. We have created a community of practice on LinkedIn which continues to be live with ongoing engagements with participants. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

(I wasn't able to add the tag "innovation challenge" above). We used a national innovation challenge to create the space to bring innovators to us in the fragmented ecosystem. Innovators are also often based in dispersed locations which we could not access for various reasons. With broad reach on social media and other online platforms, as well as direct recruitment, we managed to surface 63 innovators in this thematic area.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Abagold and Paternoster Oyster Company. They are collaborating with us and the innovators to test and pilot their solutions. We also worked with the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship as the implementing partner on this project. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment. We partnered with the Aquaculture Research Department to assist in identifying gaps in the ocean economy and surface existing enterprises. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Abagold and Paternoster Oyster Company. 'Informal' relationship development allowed us to collaborate indirectly with these private sector firms without needing formal contracts and extensive due diligence. This is special as it is a new 'model' for scaling for us. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Developing relationships with private sector commercial firms has allowed us to provide the space and support for 7 innovators to pilot and test their solutions. These relationships will not only provide infrastructure, lab testing, experience and expertise to our innovators, but these corporates will also not be taking any equity or contributions from the businesses. This allows for a model of scaling that does not infringe on innovators’ intellectual property rights.

 

The need for the identification and direct recruiting of innovators has allowed us to generate insights regarding implementation design for innovation challenges in undeveloped sectors. We know now that we need to commit time to ecosystem mapping, relationship development, building trust with actors, and ensuring continuous feedback to keep them engaged.
