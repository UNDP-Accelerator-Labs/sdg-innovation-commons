The website 'Metaschool' was created to facilitate the choice of education that parents make for their children as well as for students who want to make better choices for themselves. Parents and everyone else can use this website to see the performance and conditions of schools such as laboratory, equipment in the ICT classrooms, and also to make a comparison for the best choice. Everyone can see the symbol of casinos which are frequently located near the schools and have a great negative impact.
