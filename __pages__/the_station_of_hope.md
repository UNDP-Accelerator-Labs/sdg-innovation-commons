> NEED: What need does this answer?

Normally for petrostation we currently see some tables on wich we just drop the batles containing the fuel. The magic part of this solution is that it is use to carry in small space 14 botles of 1L. I was wondering what was the top for? Amazingly structured to be protecting against fuel evaporation due to the sun and at the same time water infiltration during rain. The base support is made of Car ray that is strongly maintained fixed the the ground.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

The HOPE here is defined by the Courage Mohamed had got from the lesson he learned from his 3 years jurney trying to reach Europe. By this little market, he will not lose hope and faith to the fact that one day from his home he will create something better for himself and his familly. As a reminder, Mohamed Bah has a University degree and is still looking to the horizon to get a JoB.
