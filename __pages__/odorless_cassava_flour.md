## Aminata B.K. Suma’s innovative solution is producing, packaging, branding, and marketing dry odourless cassava flour (for fufu) in Sierra Leone. Currently, fufu produced in Sierra Leone is in wet form with 40-50% moisture. As a result, it has a very distinct odour, high starch content, and a very short shelf life. Her product is rich in protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins that are good for children, young people, and adults. This solution seeks to address the problem of hunger, ending poverty, and promote good health and well-being.
