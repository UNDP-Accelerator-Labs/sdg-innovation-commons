## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

May 6th 

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Digital Inclusion 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Caribbean environments can be difficult for persons with disabilities  (PWDs) to navigate. This can therefore affect their ability to access certain jobs. The use of digital tools and exposure to digital market places can provide an opportunity for PWDs to work virtually.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can a digital training be designed and delivered to enable persons with disabilities (PWDs) to gain
employment online using the Work Online Dominica (WOD)



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Experimental (RCTs, etc.)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

In Dominica due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the loss of jobs and livelihoods
the Work Online Dominica (WOD) initiative a partnership between the Ministry of Public Works and The
Digital Economy, IsraAID and UNDP was instituted. The goal of the program was to provide participants with
the digital skills required through the delivery of one-on-one calls and mentorship. The programme to date
has trained 105 persons between the ages of 18 and 40 years and has enabled 82 persons to secure online
work.

Given the success of the programme, focus is now being placed on increasing its inclusiveness by delivering
a track which specifically focuses on enabling persons with disabilities (PWDs) with the digital skills necessary
to gain employment online.

 


> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the WOD programme can be successfully delivered to PWDs then persons with disabilities would have an additional avenue to employment which considers their disability.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The current model of training will de delivered under the Work Online Dominica (WOD) to cater to PWD.

Previous experiences from the three (3) cohorts of the Work Online Dominica (WOD) will be used to enhance the programme.

A consultant will be selected to guide the PWDs through the course and capture the qualitative feedback on potential improvements and inclusions of the programme.

It will be determined whether this model can support further scaling both within the Dominica context and
regionally.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Qualitative data on the programme and its improvements.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Qualitative data and reviews.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
