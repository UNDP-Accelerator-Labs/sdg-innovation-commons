A Love Letter to the City


Designed & hand-sewed at a small workshop in Bình Thạnh, Dòng Dòng cherishes to manifest the aesthetics of Sài Gòn, to tell a lovely story about the City.


Dòng Dòng aims to create durable and unique recycled bags with high functionality, raising our little voice for the environment.


Collect used tarps

Collect used tarps from local awnings, tarpaulins, truck covers stores. Normally, used tarps would have gone straight to the dumpsters. Hence, we often call those occasions of collecting as tarp-rescue trips. CONTACT US TO DONATE USED TARPS

Cut & wash

Tarps are washed and cleaned with unharmful substances like antiseptic liquid, vinegar, and baking soda. Indeed, scratches from the tarps' previous life are treated as unique pattern of this weather-resistant material. We don’t try to wash away the story of the tarp itself.

Design & sew

Each product of Dòng Dòng is a unique piece, creatively designed and hand-sewed depending on the colors and patterns of tarps collected. We spend time in details, and once again, prevent tarp leftovers from the process.
