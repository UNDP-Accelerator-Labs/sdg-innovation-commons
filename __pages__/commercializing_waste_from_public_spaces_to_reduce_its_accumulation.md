- Public Sector
- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Municipalities, PET potencial buyers


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if facilitating the commercialization of waste can help reduce the accumulation of waste in public spaces. Often, waste gets accumulated in a space because there is visible waste accumulated in the area. If instead of letting waste accumulate and having to invest resources to clean, if the waste generates income, then it will become a more sustainable practice.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the collection of PET waste is facilitated to market it, then the accumulation of PET waste disposed of in public spaces will be reduced.



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

First, we need to select the

sample of 30 locations (locations with public spaces). Ideally, the localities

should be similar in socioeconomic characteristics and not be close to each

other. For example, blocks could be selected. Then, a draw must be made to

determine in which blocks efforts will be made to facilitate the capture of PET

for its market. An effort of this type could be containers placed and guarded

in a space to avoid their wrong use, where it´s indicated that the PET

deposited will contribute to raising funds for public improvements. A potencial

buyer of the PET must be arranged beforehand. For each locality in the sample,

the amount of PET disposed in public spaces must be measured before and after

the action is implemented. 



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The different localities with public spaces



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Direct observation



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 weeks 



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time to reach the waste buyer and using the waste containers.
