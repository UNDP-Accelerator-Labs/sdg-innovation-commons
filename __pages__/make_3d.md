Make 3D

> Solution description

In partnership with AccLab Gambia, Make 3D train Gambians on 3D printing and modeling. Importantly, this technology supports local communities to add value to their homemade and recycled products for higher economic gains.  Recently, the initiative is been implemented in Njao, a remote community in rural Gambia, where women use the technology to brand their products such as locally-made soaps.
