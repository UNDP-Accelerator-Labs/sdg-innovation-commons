ARD Agriculture & Regenerative Development is an agricultural company registered in Jordan dedicated to promote organic & regenerative agriculture and ecological restoration.

​

Founded in 2020 it aims to bridge and nurture the link between the world of agriculture and society for a positive ecological impact in Jordan and beyond.

​

ARD was born out of our deep concern about climate change and our ultimate goals are climate change mitigation, adaptation and impact reduction through the spread of regenerative agriculture - agricultural practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere and put it back in the soil - in Jordan and the region. 

​

ARD centre is located in Taybeh Organic Farms, Wadi Rajeb, Ajloun, Jordan.
