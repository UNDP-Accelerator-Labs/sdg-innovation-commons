> Title of the innovation

Baroste fruit processing and out grower scheme. Rural transformation through agriculture. value addition, appropriate technology and environmental friendly processing.The Baroste fruit processing and out grower scheme will be the largest fruit processing plant in Zambia with state of the art off grid cost efficient irrigation and power supply. This unique Mango juice processing will be implemented in western province in the communities along the Zambezi river. Though Mangoes are grown extensively is several rural areas of Zambia, most go to waste with between 30-40% going to waste without farmers getting the financial benefit due to several factors such as lack of transport to markets, technology to preserve the fruits and lack of value addition on the raw product that makes the cost of transportation uneconomical.

> Brief description of the innovation

This project aims at addressing the “lost income” by providing ready market, Increase plantations,improvement in production practices, introduce improved varieties and provide alternative income resource for the poverty stricken communities through the installation of modern solar powered irrigation system and construction of a processing plant near Mongu. We expect to create wealth for locals and investors, create jobs, increased income at household level and improvement of social infrastructure and general livelihood in the participating communities. The business model will also implement corporate social responsibility projects in the health, education, water and sanitation as well as installation of social amenities. A first of its kind off grid solar and wind energy powered high-tech irrigation system and manufacturing plant in western province of Zambia. Supported by a core 500-hectare farm to produce the minimum for operation and 6,000 small scale out grower farmers along the Zambezi river and flood plains of western province. Western province is considered one of the poorest provinces of Zambia with up to 80% poverty and yet has one of the nation’s largest water resources that can be used to turn the current status of western province into a hub of food production, industrial hub and attract investors in other areas of the economy. Other complimenting fruits to be considered for intercropping include Oranges, Avocadoes, sugar cane, Bananas, Pineapples Paw paws and Lemons to cover the seasonality of Mangoes. We also intend to include a bottled mineral water plant as well as an Aloe Vera production and processing facility. Depending on the suitability of the soils and conducive weather for the proposed fruits. Further the process will strive to utilize the by products can be used as stock feed by livestock farmers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The commercial viability of Mangoes is evident in Zambia from the establishment of businesses such as Chankwankwa farms and Food Processing limited in Central and Luapula provinces. That has benefited over 900 small scale farmers with the support of Musika. COMACO is another organisation that is involved in drying of Mangoes for consumption outside the season. Most fresh fruit and vegetables in Zambia found in South Africa chain stores such as Shoprite, Pick and pay, Freshmark and Choopies is imported from South Africa because of quality, inconsistent supply and volumes required which most local supplies are not able to meet. The main product which is 100% Mango fruit juice has already market as it is healthier and taste better than most imported and local carbonated and artificial flavoured juices on the market. A study in Zambia by Mukonde Siafunda of Texila University showed that profits margins were higher for processed at 47% rather than producers, 26% and middle men or trader at 27%. This is mainly due to a disorganized marketing system which disadvantages the producer.

An environmental impact assessment would be undertaken but similar projects have shown that as long as relevant authorities are engaged from conception stage, such as ZEMA and other state actors, no significant negative impact are projected. With the environmental friendly and energy efficient power and irrigation systems that will be implemented.
RISK PLAN
Price negotiations and grading of produce to be handled by professional body.
To establish an early warning system to prevent disease outbreaks and unexpected stoppages.
Insurance of both core farm and out grower produce against unexpected loses.

> Technical Feasibility

a) will generate income for you or others or
For the out growers, a guaranteed market for their mangoes at a competitive price.
For the local community who will be employed through salaries
For shareholders and investors through the profits from the sales of bottled water, fruit juice, fresh fruits, exports and excess power.
The mobile money agents will get income from the numerous transactions between farmers and the processing plant. 
b) how it can be assisting improving operations of existing businesses,
The operations of local businesses are expected to be assisted by introduction of a reliable source of income that will increase the cash in circulation that can boost the buying power of the community. 
Engage them as suppliers of goods and services that the farmers, facilities and offices will be using.
Prioritizing local business to benefit from any Invitations to tender opportunities within their capacity that will be available.
