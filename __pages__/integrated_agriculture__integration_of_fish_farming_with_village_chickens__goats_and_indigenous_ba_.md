Integrated agriculture  integration of fish farming with village chickens, goats and indigenous banana plantation.

Village chickens will provide droppings to feed the goats and the goats droppings will be used to fertilize the fish ponds in order to grow the fish as well as fertilize the bananas and fruit trees which in turn give food to goats and secure the land from erosion and degradation.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project will produce fish, village chickens, eggs, bananas and goats which will be supplied to the local market in Solwezi and the neighboring DR Congo. Local marketeers will be given priority to buy in to resell to the public.
The prize will help me accelerate implement the project and secure it.
The bananas and fruit trees will protect the land from erosion, while the dropping from the chickens and goats will retain the fertility of the soil allowing micro organisms to thrive.

> Technical Feasibility

I doing 6 ponds of 300 sq meters and planting 500 bananas. I have a four hector piece of land, 40 she goats and 2 he-goat plus 50 village chickens already.
I need support for housing, wire fencing and feed to get me developing.
