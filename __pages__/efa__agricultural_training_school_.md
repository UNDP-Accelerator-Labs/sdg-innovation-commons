The objective is to provide study opportunities to young Guatemalans with limited economic resources in rural areas of the country, but with great desire to excel. Since its foundation, the EFA has contributed to the agricultural development of our country, incorporating into society technicians with academic excellence and theoretical and practical knowledge in agricultural sciences. People who receive support from the EFA can learn to use technological tools related to agricultural production.

Interesting fact: People can study a career, but shorter practical courses are also offered for interested communities and groups.
