## Enseignements sur votre défi

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

I have learned that:
-Many staff have knowledge of GIS, with only 10.5% reporting no knowledge;
-More than half (52.6%) still have 'beginner' level knowledge;
-The integration of GIS into the office's projects/programmes and operations is still very low;
-Geospatial technologies make it possible to access certain information remotely with tools such as remote sensing, which can help monitor certain initiatives in crisis areas ;
-Mobile data collection tools such as Kobocollect save time in terms of inputting, pre-analysing and displaying information collected in the field in near-real time.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, a bit of resistance from project managers, who don't seem very comfortable introducing new tools into their day-to-day work. However, there was a lot of interest from the operations staff.

## Données et méthodes

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

This data filled a number of gaps. For example, as test data for this experiment, we had statistical data on the Local Development Index, but we wanted to develop a more suitable visualisation of knowledge products adapted to the target (decision-makers, mayors, etc.) and we also used GIS open data from the World Resources Institute to visualise this data on a map. We also used spatio-temporal data from Google Earth to detect land cover changes in a given place between two periods. We also carried out a survey before the workshop to find out participants' level of knowledge and areas of interest.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

TThe following methods were adapted to the challenge and the context, and enabled us to explore together the potential of geospatial technologies and to think together about how to integrate them with practical examples (visualisation of the information gathered, etc.)

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Innovation methods and new forms of data have enabled us to generate new knowledge that we wouldn't have been able to obtain otherwise, insofar as accelerating the achievement of the SDGs by integrating geospatial technologies into the various phases of our intervention (planning, implementation and monitoring-evaluation) requires specific tools and data, namely GIS and geographic data. And this learning experience help us to highlight the interaction between those tools and data, but also the added value that this can bring.
