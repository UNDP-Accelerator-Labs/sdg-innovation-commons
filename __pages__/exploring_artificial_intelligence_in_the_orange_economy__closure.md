## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

We worked with government and the Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society on hosting the A.I. Symposium on Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage. Based on this event which included 6 panels of subject matter experts, we gathered the following insights:

1) The Double-Edged Sword of A.I.

Several panelists noted the many benefits that A.I. can bring to the Orange Economy in the Caribbean, including democratizing access to cultural heritage, enhancing arts education capacities and opening new markets for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Many of these positive shifts are already being seen, even if on a small scale. On the flipside, numerous risks were noted - with the potential for A.I. to exacerbate inequalities, further entrench biases, and threaten cultural diversity. From a security standpoint, ethical concerns around data use, privacy, and intellectual property were frequently raised. This resulted in a double-edged sword dynamic requiring proper stewardship to ensure the safe usage of A.I. for creative purposes. 

2) Ethics, Equity and Human Rights

Many emphasized that any application of A.I. in the arts sector should be firmly rooted in an ethical framework based on human dignity, cultural specificity, and inclusivity. This included calls for a transparent, fair and rights-based approach to A.I. regulation. Additionally, given that A.I. tools are often consumed rather than produced in the Caribbean, it was recognized that A.I. must be anchored in local values rather than those imported externally from global tech hubs. This reflects the reality that dominant A.I. systems typically include Western biases and exclude Caribbean perspectives. As such, there is a need to train A.I. on regional data while also making efforts to protect that data from misuse.

3) Governance Gaps and the Demand for Regional Strategy

In Barbados and among the wider Caribbean, A.I. policies are under development, especially when it comes to the creative industries where issues such as deepfakes, voice cloning and unauthorized use of likenesses are prevalent. In this process, there is the distinct challenge of keeping up with the fast speed of A.I. technologies, which are constantly evolving. To address this nascent governance field, regional collaboration was recommended with emphasis on solutions co-designed with grassroots communities, artists, technologists and policymakers alongside institutions such as UNDP, BMHS and ICOM as key partners. This Caribbean-wide approach could together address A.I. policy, digital infrastructure and cultural preservation.

4) A.I. and the Orange Economy

The Orange Economy, encompassing economic activities derived from creativity, culture and innovation, is home to specific complexities when it comes to A.I., such as the requirement for protection of intellectual property in music, film, and literature. Several artists underscored the importance of understanding digital ownership, authorship and authentication in the age of A.I., resulting in a strong demand for digital rights and policies that prioritize creators. Additionally, fair compensation for creatives was mentioned and tied to the devaluation of art forms that could occur through A.I., as well as the risks of job displacement posed by emerging tools in graphic design, sound production and editing.

5) Education and Digital Capacity Building  

The Government of Barbados is integrating digital capacity-building efforts into the classroom, seen in coding, digital literacy and civics in the curriculum. These efforts are ultimately preparing students for a future deeply impacted by A.I. At the same time, arts education is focusing on critical thinking, responsible technology use and empowering youth to be active creators rather than passive consumers. This also connects to instilling a sense of integrity and ownership among art producers in the A.I. landscape.

6) A.I. and Heritage Preservation

Globally in the heritage field, A.I. is being used to digitize heritage-based archives, enhance metadata creation and support conservation. The digitization of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which includes language, rituals, crafts and oral traditions, is a bit more complex, however, as these elements are harder to digitize and protect. Panelists found that A.I. can help document ICH, but that the fundamentals of trust, consent and cultural sensitivity must be established first. To best future-proof these efforts, the significance of open-source tools, distributed storage and non-proprietary formats for sustainability purposes were voiced.

7) Gender, LGBTQIA+ Rights &amp; Digital Safety  

Depending on its use, A.I. can amplify marginalized voices or reinforce systemic biases, thus necessitating a stringent approach to regulation and oversight. Concerns around automated harassment, surveillance, and data exploitation were raised. To mitigate these potential pitfalls, panelists recommended intersectionality, community-led safeguards and inclusive data practices in A.I. 

8) A.I. in Archaeology &amp; Heritage Preservation

In archaeology, history is meeting modern technology through applications of A.I. to geophysical surveys, predictive modeling and 3D reconstructions of archaeological sites. This presents valuable inroads to repatriation, education, and cultural storytelling. Still, worries about data ownership, community consent and digital colonialism were expressed as worthy of greater attention and investigation.

9) Call to Action: Local Innovation &amp; Collaboration  

Resoundingly heard throughout the panels was a call for the Caribbean to get involved in developing its own A.I. tools while training local talent and shaping global technology narratives. To do so, a push was made for collaboration across sectors, merging government, academia, civil society and creatives together. Overall, A.I. was deemed a transformative opportunity if approached with care, equity, and strategic vision.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We conducted a post-mortem with the Barbados Museum &amp; Historical Society on next steps, including the potential creation of a creative advisory group on regional A.I. issues. Additionally, insights captured were shared with a public audience in blog format. Otherwise, this engagement has closed.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose these types of data to get a sense of how A.I. is impacting the Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage sphere, both through desk research and also by allowing for community insights to surface through a public dialogue hosted where panelists were invited to respond to audience Q&amp;A and interact with the guests on thematic areas of interest. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

As A.I. is a nascent field that is just begging to shape the Caribbean region, we had to facilitate a space for public dialogue and discussion to occur in this area. In doing so, concerns and opportunity areas expressed were mapped for potential inclusion in future A.I. policy. This type of dialogue on this subject has not occurred on a scale large enough to garner public views on A.I.'s applications to society/culture and as such, we opted to host a community conversation.

## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By combining various innovation methods, data and unusual actors together, we uncovered findings and insights regarding A.I. in relation to Caribbean Arts &amp; Heritage that would otherwise be missed, such as on local and regional nuances in this field that are not shaping the global conversation. This includes how A.I. systems are owned by the Global North and a lack of representative data, which results in biases regarding Caribbean culture in A.I.
