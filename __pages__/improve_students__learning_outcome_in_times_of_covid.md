## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Among the 3 outcomes of students' learning (Math, Physics, Chemistry), Edemy online learning app did increase students' score in Physics and Chemistry.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
None

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Not enough collaboration and endorsement among relevant stakeholders.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

It addresses causality's questions and helps evaluators/implementers to know concrete results of the intervention and not anything else.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It addresses causes and affects of the issue.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Edemy who provided their online learning app (Tesdopi) to students for free of charge so that we could conduct our experiment. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We tried to engage with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, but didn't get it through. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Edemy as they are local solution provider and a social enterprise. They understood the context and content of the learning app, Tesdopi.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We tried to get UNICEF involved and had meetings with them a few times in testing this learning platform. Yet, they didn't show much interest. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Despite how good or innovative the methods or ideas are, if weren't not enough collaboration among relevant stakeholders, the results were not useful or used.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.

Tesdopi តេស្ត១២ is an assess-and-improve tool to help high school students excel in math and science subjects. Students can test their competencies by topic and master the individual competencies that they have not yet acquired by watching tutorial videos and practice on the app or seek help from their teachers and other resources, thus prevent a student from falling behind.
