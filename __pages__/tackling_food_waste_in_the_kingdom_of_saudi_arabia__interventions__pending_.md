> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The potential governmental partner identified (Saudi Grains Organization) have yet to respond to our proposal of creating a Food Waste Multi-stakeholder Workshop and the CO is recommended to have a national partner for these activities.&nbsp;

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We have collected qualitative data through interviews with 6 stakeholders from different sectors: private sector (large scale as well as a start-up), a non-profit organization, and academia which informed a concept paper shared with a list of potential interventions. We have created a small social media campaign to capitalize on the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste. The purpose of this campaign in not only to raise awareness on this issue and highlight our activity at UNDP but also identifying citizens (indirectly) who would be interested in joining the multi-stakeholder workshop.&nbsp;

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Determining key stakeholders and local solutions and fostering relationships for potential partnerships.&nbsp;In addition, we have taken this opportunity to shed light on innovators that are exploring innovative ways to tackle food waste in Saudi Arabia through our "Meet The Innovator Sessions".
## Partners

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We had support from the UN Resident Coordinators Office to promote the small&nbsp;social media campaign done during the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste&nbsp;and they connected us with UNEP to share their video campaign as part of ours. We have been exploring with UNEP ways to collaborate further in regards to our planned multi-stakeholder workshop.
## End
