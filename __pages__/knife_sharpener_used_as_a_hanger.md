Multiple usage of every-day things - knife-sharpener/bags hanger

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

I noticed that plastic bags are hanging on the unknown (to me) object. Then I approached the sales woman asking what this black and red object was and it turned out to be a knife sharpener. The lady (Botagoz) mentioned that her husband came up with this idea so that they do not need to buy extra hangers. Interestingly enough, when I approached another counter where sales team had the same sharpener, they said they bought hangers for the plastic bags. This shows how people have a different viewpoint towards the same object.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

This idea does not necessarily answer a need, but shows how people re-use common every day objects.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

The lesson of this example is how people approach same common objects in a different way. For example, this shop was the only one that was using the knife sharpener as a hanger even though most shops had the same knife sharpener.
