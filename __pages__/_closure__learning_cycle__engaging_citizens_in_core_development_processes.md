## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Citizens want to participate in processes that have embedded experiments/pilots/or new innovative tools for citizens engagement. We believe this is true for our #water crowd-mapping initiative, where through a  citizens initiative, the Lab in North Macedonia created an interactive, open and free map of the majority of public drinking fountains in the city of Skopje, with 1/3 of all data points visible on the map coming directly from citizens that took part in this challenge. 2. Embedding Foresight in national development processes inspires citizens engagement. Echoing the previous insight, we see the same level of citizens engagement in the Dream Labs that the country office is organizing, and some that the Accelerator Lab has co-hosted, as a part of our support to the development of a National Development Strategy. Embedding foresight in the NDS process, has given our organization a tool to have a discussion with citizens on 'what we want to see in the future/ where we would like to be', rather than just to have a conversation about the obstacles we have in the present.  Citizens want to take part, and influence development processes, and UNDP is in a position to provide spaces where institutions and citizens can come together to share ideas and challenges. 3. Through a rapid ethnographic research on sustainable water management in rural/urban communities in North Macedonia, the Lab learned that a particular element of pride that came up in conversations in the rural communities, was the collective constructions of those systems through citizens contributions. In almost all villages that were a part of our research, one could find the remnants of collective infrastructures – dirt or paved canals with running water alongside almost each home, canals that were primarily constructed for irrigation, and where any household can source water with no requirements to pay for its use. This collective construction of infrastructure continues today as well, with many village communities finding ways to deal with issues independently, where the diaspora members helped fund infrastructure processes, through the local community units. In that regard, it is natural to see collective infrastructure as more than just the material. Collective infrastructure is, in its functional nature, inseparable with the human element of contribution and management. It consists of more than just underground pipes - encompassing collective memories of labor actions, direct financial contributions, and local management. 4.  We  learned, through several policy pilots, designed to test the best ways to promote the functionalities of a digital engagement platform [www.nrs.mk] that once citizens visit our website, they do not spend a lot of time there [average time spent on site was above 2 minutes], and that allowed the country office team to go in a process of re-designing the website to allow for better citizens engagement.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One of the barriers that we experienced in this process, working on this frontier challenge is navigating through the multiple stakeholders that are a part of these initiatives. For instance, within the NDS process, our team has to collaborate with our DG unit, but also with the other UN agencies, on top of the national institutions and the supporters of the process. This often makes

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Our office, nor our institutions have used crowd-mapping for the purposes of engaging citizens in a process, nor for raising awareness about a particular topic. We believed it is an opportune moment to test/experiment with the tool and the process within our water initiative.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used these innovation methods for two main reasons. One to test their roll- out in our country office and community [rapid ethnography, dream labs/foresight, public policy pilots/experiments, crowd-mapping/sourcing]. More importantly, because we believed that the insights from citizens and the type of learning we will obtain with this combination of methods is unique and will create new type of actionable items to the country office and our national institutions.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In our #Water initiative we collaborated with the Scouts Association in North Macedonia, as well as the YES Abroad Program. Regarding the #Heat initiative we collaborated with the Arsht-Rock Resilience Center, as well as the Chief Heat Officer of Athens. For our #DreamLabs we collaborated with a range of stakeholders in both the design of the Labs but also who we invited to take part. For instance the Dream Lab related to water management invited colleagues from: academia, CSOs, high school students that have been a part of the UNICEF UpShift challenge, as well as

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

On several of the Dream Labs we collaborated with University Professors in MKD, but also the Macedonian Academy of Arts and Sciences. The collaboration was both for shaping the design of the Labs but also for them to participate in the sessions.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

For the policy pilots, we collaborated with a media company in North Macedonia, that helped us test the designed experiment aimed at learning more about citizens engagement with our digital platform.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Public water utility company - for the water initiative [they provided us with the data they had on water fountains]. Dream Labs [national institutions, including Academy of Arts and Sciences, Deputy PM for Economic Affairs, General Secretariat of the government]. Chief HEAT officer of Athens and the Arsht-Rock center for resilience for the Heat initiative.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

We believe it was the first time we collaborated with the Arhst-Rock center and the Chief Heat Officer of Athens.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborated with UNICEF on the Dream Lab for #water, as well as with the entire UN system for the NDS process.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The insights our country office & our institutions received from the: water initiative [crowd-mapping + rapid ethnography] and the dream labs [our Accelerator Lab organized 6 online dream Labs and few physical ones] were unique because they provided bottom up insights on challenges and opportunities that our projects and processes have never captured before. They also included citizens in the process of discovery, something that we rarely do as an office.
