My innovations ICT1110 ,MATH 1110,ICT 2010, EDU 1010 e.t.c are the first of its
kind at the university of zambia , am glad to be a Pioneer in digitalizing our
universities and schools,they come in to give the best studying and material as
well in well organised manner,how do you acces it just my searching your preferred
course on Google playstore with a click you have acces to the revolutionary app.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My first approach is to make innovation free but ads will be displaying once a user
is connected to the internet and the second is to partner with respective
universities so that the universities can be funding my project,my innovation has
helped many student at university of zambia and am looking forward to extend to
other univerisities as,the feedback i get from the students is overwhelming.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed to meet the critical need of a student ,as it is time
effecient in one click,all the best and well organised studying materials at your
finger tip,my apps have passed both beta and alpha stage,2 are on playstore,by the
end this year i want to deploy as many as can in my capacity,my end goal is to
extend this innovation to the rest of the universities in this nation and beyond the diaspora.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As we are all aware about the deadly covid 19,hence we are in the critical time to
observe social distancing,The app comes with the necessary materials for
particular course so no need to physically meeting a friend to get studying
materials,as it is right now all the universities closed including the university of
zambia the innovation comes handy to the students as they access the best and
well organised materials at the comfort of their respective homes.
It is a well known fact that our society is digitalizing hence Elearning is not an
Exception to the institutions offering education so my INNOVATION comes in to
