We upcycle wastes such as food organic wastes coffee grounds olive wastes to a higher value products such as charcoal briquettes biomass briquettes compost pellets bio oil and biogas for self use The best thing about this is that : - We produce zero wastes and total clean energy means we tackle pollution and produce clean energy - we gonna use a mobile application to collect wastes so everyone can participate and gain money means to tackle poverty - the market is hungry for this product so we gonna go to export means reviving the economy.
