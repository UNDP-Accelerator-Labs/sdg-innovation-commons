## 

<div>With the help of undergraduates and international design collaborators, Amos Winter a mechanical engineering, has designed a wheelchair device that can carry users comfortably and efficiently off-road. The device it's intended to help people in countries where the access to wheelchairs is limited, but also where the rough terrain and the long distance travels are a limitation. It is small and maneuverable indoors too. Given the need to have a wheelchair that can move through rocky and muddy paths, the Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC) performs like a combination of a desk chair and a mountain bike. The deviced has been tested with the people that would use it to make sure it's efficient and useful. The LFC it's now to be prototyped and tested with 30 persons in Guatemala. <br></div>
