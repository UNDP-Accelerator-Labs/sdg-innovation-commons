## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Smart and affordable access to energy through renewable sources 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that we would like to test whether it is possible to accelerate off-grid electrification to many Angolans living in rural areas in particularly through accessing affordable and clean energy, improving standards of living, promoting agriculture productivity and increasing national electricity coverage. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

  

Affordable and sustainable energy constitutes one of the six Strategic Impact Areas of UNDP’s Africa Promise. In Angola, only about 45% population has access to electricity. Within rural area the rate is much lower. People

tend to rely on charcoal or wood as source of energy. Estimated 18,909,000 people in Angola are without access to clean and affordable energy.

  

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Expansion of agriculture impacted by the absence of electricity in rural areas. Agriculture is a priority for diversification and job creation.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab Angola feels that can be of value on 1) Through system thinking approach; support the coordination of sectors involved, presenting the "balcony view" of the electricity system in Angola and how they can all better be involved and impacting those on electrical poverty; 2) Foster the emergence of local energy starts ups able to provide new solutions by creating the enabling environment for their growth in collaboration with Academia and Private Sector. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are looking for ways for millions of Angolans access affordable and clean energy through working with key stakeholders capable of influence and provide new and effective energy solutions in particularly for the rural and other remote zones.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the main drivers that are currently influencing the lack of access to energy in rural areas? What are the causes and main obstacles that contribute to a very low level of access to energy in the rural areas? How UNDP SDG integrator role can  boost energy access? 

  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Conduct analytical roadmap on Angolan Energy Sector ; 

2. Undertake a sensemaking and systems thinking exercises with key stakeholders and necessary subsequent engagements to complement the analytical roadmap 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

System thinking and mapping approach can help understanding ongoing initiatives and plans about the nature of energy system that are currently not captured. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

People in the rural area in particular are one of the main beneficiaries of this challenge. A close engagement with main decision makers influencing distribution and access is important. Possibility of testing pilots with TRAC 2 funding in a systemic approach.
