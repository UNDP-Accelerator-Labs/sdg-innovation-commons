Establishment of biogas based electricity plants in the poultry farms reduces dependency on fossil fuel used forerunning captive generators. This also ensures bio-security and proper litter management in these farms. Moreover, slurry produced in the digesters as byproduct is a good bio-fertilizer. According to the Livestock Department, currently there are more than 150,000 poultry farms in Bangladesh with about 1,500 farms having more than 20,000 birds population. So, Bangladesh has good potential for biogas based electricity projects. Biogas plants not only provide gas for cooking purpose but also produce organic fertilizer for the crops and fish pond. The program helps reduce the use of biomass fuel for cooking. Till December 2021, IDCOL has financed construction of over 61,200 biogas plants all over the country through its 37 partner organizations. IDCOL finances plants with daily gas production capacity ranging from 1.2 m3 to 25.0 m3 thereby meeting demand of both domestic households and mid-sized dairy and poultry farms. IDCOL currently finances two models of biogas plants: brick-cement based plants and pre-fabricated bio-digester based plants. The program saves 58,750 tons of firewood ever year worth USD 4.6 million and also reduces the use of 52,000 tons of chemical fertilizer worth USD 13.6 million by producing 363,000 tons of organic fertilizer. The program also reduces 234,000 ton CO2 consumption per annum.
