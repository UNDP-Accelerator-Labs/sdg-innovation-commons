National Human Development Report for Serbia https://hdr.undp.org.rs  The Solution Lies in the People Who Are There Around Us, an article written by Danilo Vukovic, an editor of the National Human Development Report for Serbia https://www.undp.org/serbia/blog/solution-lies-people-who-are-there-around-us  (This text was originally published in the Serbian language in Novi Magazin weekly, in June 2022: https://novimagazin.rs/iz-nedeljnika-nm/275468-danilo-vukovic-resenje-je-u-ljudima-koji-su-tu-oko-nas)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

For us, one of the greatest obstacles was orchestrating many different stakeholders and new structures (new PMO team, new Ministries, donors, etc.) that are simultaneously engaged in portfolio development and operationalisation. In addition, we continue to face the challenge of maintaining momentum without donor funding, when the government changes and donors are not ready for cross-cutting issues to deal with.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

NHDR referenced all the research done by the Accelerator Lab with alternative data, and results of facebook data analysis, mobile and satellite data were highlighted, as additional valuable insights related to population dynamics.

In our work overall, we combined qualitative and quantitative research; we used qualitative data to provide context and depth to the findings of the quantitative data, and vice versa.

These types of data were closer to real time and they are a great addition to traditional data (census, and other statistical data provided by the Statistical Office of Serbia)

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It helped us to design more coherent national, regional and local-level policies, and locally tailored social policies that support diversely ageing regions, and to address the lack of opportunities for residents and marginalized social groups.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Returning Point (https://tackapovratka.rs/en/) is a program that fosters circular migration and assists in the return of highly-qualified expatriates while channelling active communication between Serbia and its diaspora around the world. It is a hub that establishes connections between local talent and diaspora initiatives that are focused on transformation, research, science and culture. This initiative was launched with the support of Serbian Entrepreneurs (San Francisco, USA), the Science and Technology Park Belgrade, and the Office of the Prime Minister of Serbia, and underwent incubation and capacity building within the UNDP Initiation Plan in close collaboration with Accelerator Lab and SDGs Integration Plan within UNDP Serbia. United National Development Program has been one of the key partners and supporters since January 2020. Since January 2020, the United Nations Development Program has been one of the most important partners and supporters. AccLab worked closely with Returning Point primarily in the areas of initiating and co-designing program activities, as well as supervising the quality of their work and ensuring that their activities are designed to be learning opportunities. 




Some of the products of our collaboration that we could highlight :

Guides for returnees (https://tackapovratka.rs/vodiczapovratnike/), a digital platform for Serbian diaspora and returnees, made using design thinking methodology

Carta Serbica (https://tackapovratka.rs/en/projekti/carta-serbica/), a program intended for individuals from the Serbian diaspora who do not hold Serbian citizenship and are interested in living, working or retiring in Serbia.

Mentorship programme (https://tackapovratka.rs/en/programi/mentorstvo/), a mentorship program that connects and provides support to Serbian returnees by matching them with mentors  

Infostud job-matching platform (https://tackapovratka.rs/en/programi/radi/), collaboration with the largest job platform in Serbia. A platform shows current job opportunities suitable for people with international experience so that our diaspora and potential returnees have a better understanding what are their options. 

Work from Home, work from Serbia (https://tackapovratka.rs/destinacija-srbija/), an experiment that we ran during COVID-19, presenting Serbia as a remote work-friendly destination.




Digital Serbia Initiative and BelgradeGets.Digital 

Another key partner that helped us with exploratory entry points of the Depopulation portfolio was Digital Serbia Initiative “DSI”. (https://www.dsi.rs/en/). The mission of this NGO is to build a robust, globally competitive digital economy in Serbia. 




Together with them, we launched the initiative called BelgradeGets.Digital Initiative (https://belgradegets.digital/) was envisioned as a spinoff of the Lab that will carry forward the work on (foreign) digital nomads and digital professionals in Serbia. BelgradeGets.Digital Initiative attracting digital professionals to Serbia was mapped through our solution mapping exercise. AccLab identified the local website (MoveToBelgrade.com), which we assisted in rebranding to BelgradeGetsDiital and becoming the main online destination for promoting Belgrade as an attractive destination for the lifestyle and work of digital nomads and other digital professionals from around the world. 




For the Depopulation Portfolio, digital nomads and digital professionals were identified as positive deviance that we wanted to explore as a trend. Throughout our work, besides launching the Webportal, together with DSI we:

launched “Digital Nomad Scanner" (https://undp.medium.com/understanding-digital-nomads-38f71678e884  and https://www.undp.org/serbia/publications/digital-nomads-scanner), 

run an exercise in mapping potential infrastructure needs throughout the country in areas with the potential for the formation of the digital nomad and digital professional communities with the goal of improving the offering to both foreign and domestic digital professionals, and 

led a vaccination programme for the digital nomads/professionals that we supported (https://belgradegets.digital/nomad-life-back/) and executed as an experiment that formed typical online sales techniques (e.g. lead generation) that we borrowed from the business and IT world.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Throughout our work on depopulation, we organized a Depopulation Data Challenge as an open call for multidisciplinary teams to develop various digital/data-driven depopulation solutions. This collaboration was initiated and orchestrated by Accelerator Lab.

https://lab.undp.org.rs/depopulation-data-challenge/ 

For the HDR work, Accelerator Lab had seven professors from Vienna University, and the University of Belgrade, working on the NHDR, as well as from the Institute of Social Sciences and many others working on depopulation for the HDR project (Studio, Data challenge, etc.)




> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Infostud, the biggest job portal has been providing fresh data related to the job market, the number of people applying for jobs, jobs demand and the supply of talent. Together, we conducted a number of experiments, including the exploration of new migration patterns, collaboration with Returning Point to provide new employment opportunities for the Serbian diaspora and returnees, further workforce diaspora segmentation, exploratory work on the topic of women in STEM, etc.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Prime Minister’s Office - Integration Unit, Team for Population Issues

Accelerator Lab aided in the formation of a new three-person team of senior advisors within the Office of the Prime Minister, who started working in February 2022 to lead the development of the program with government partners and operationalize the portfolio.

This new team uses all of the HDR's findings and the Lab's previous work in this field as a basis for its work. In addition, this PMO team will continue to collaborate with the UNDP on the operationalization and localization of the portfolio's large-scale projects, through the PIF (Portfolio Initiation Framework) process. 




Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography and local mayors across the country

In order to localize the work on the Depopulation portfolio, we collaborate closely with the Ministry of Family Welfare and Demography, as well as with the mayor's offices of ten medium-sized towns/local municipalities located across the country. 




Public consultations and NHDR
We co-hosted five public consultations with the Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veterans and Social Affairs and SASA for the wider group of stakeholders (https://www.sanu.ac.rs/en/) and with the leading national counterpart Office of the Prime Minister. The aims of these consultations were:

1. To achieve a common understanding (framing) of population dynamics including depopulation: inevitable, but not catastrophic; actions required regarding human capital, not solely fertility, etc.

2. To involve the government of Serbia in the drafting of the NHDR through comments and inputs.

3. To identify potential partners for the depopulation fund and future activities.

The main participants of these consultations were: Line ministries (at the level of head of units and assistant ministers), public institutes, academia, civil society and media




> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The new Prime Minister’s Office team “Integration Unit, Team for Population Issues” and in general collaboration with the private sector (especially the IT/tech sector) 




> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked closely with UNFPA (portfolio design, NHDR); UNICEF and ILO attended some consultation sessions and provided some comments.



## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The mix of methods, new partners and data helped us engage in questioning, observing, and associational thinking (connected seemingly unconnected ideas) together with storytelling. The methods helped us deal with patterns rather than focusing on the concrete parts, and dealing with all dimensions of the system.
