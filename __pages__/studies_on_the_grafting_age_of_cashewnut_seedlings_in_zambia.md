Studies on the grafting age of cashewnut seedlings in Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Cashewnut production in zambia has been very low due to propagation methods and the poor quality planting materials as the scientists involved in cashewnut research have not been supported by Government for a long period of time. Currently the country has not produced any cashewnut variety, no appropriate time for grafting of cashewnut seedlings, no proper capacity building for cashewnut scientists. Despite all these, scientists dealing with cashewnut are trying level best to improve the cashewnut sector in zambia.One of the effort is to establish an appropriate age for grafting of cashewnut which will contribute to to increase in cashewnut production by the farmers and result in contributing to mitigation of climate change effects, increase income at households and reducing in the malnutrition levels.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will contribute to income generation through creation of busness opportunities in all the cashewnut value chain.The will busness opportunities in the seedlings production, apple and nut production, cashew processing and value addition. Due to the high demand for cashewnut products,many women and youths will be involved especially at processing and marketing of cashewnut products. They production of cashewnut will be promoted through out the country so as to meet demand for both local and international cashewnut consumption.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation will be conducted at simulumbe Research station and repeated other research centres from January to July 2022.It will involve carrying out a field experiment in the cashewnut nurseries. Cashewnut seeds will be collected, socked and planted in the poly pots and grafting of cashew seedlings to be done according to the treatments as grafting dates. Data will be collected and analysed using the Genstat and the anova. The findings will be shared with the farmers through the agricultural extension officer,other stakeholders in the field of agriculture/cashewnut industry,UNDP and climate mitigation stakeholders.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will contribute to increase in income at households and national level, reducing malnutrition,reducing the effects of climate change and create employment.
