> Title of the innovation

Pig farming

> Brief description of the innovation

Pig farming is the type of farming which only involves the keeping pigs. It's a nice farming because pigs they don't take time or years for them to be read for market, a part from that pigs they increase more in numbers in short period of time compared to other domestic animals such as cattle and goats.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I chose pig farming because I have seen and know that it's only farming business which can bring more money within a year,  according to my research I discovered that the reason why the prices for pork meet are increasing on the market  it because we only have few commercial farmers who are doing this farming, hence I come up with this plan in trying to reduce the price of pork meet on the market. Not only that once this program funded it will great jobs to the youths, the thing is that pigs are not only used for meet we can use pork fat to make soaps, also since fertilizer is becoming expensive these days people can use manure from pigs to put into their fields, therefore looking at all these I have seen that this program will not only be beneficial to only those Who eat pig as meet. Everyone will benefit from it in way another.

> Technical Feasibility

This project was planned on a ten hector of land, on which I planned to build five 20*50 piggery houses with the capacity of 80 pigs in each. This program started last year with five pigs though I sold them at early age due to the financial problem.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Giving jobs to the youths and reducing the prices for pork meet at the market. At the moment pigs are on high demand.
