Overall goal: Enhance the appearance and quality of the waterbodies which are significant for each educational community on the basis of responsible stewardship. For this purpose, the project aims to improve the appeatence and quality of waterbodies by adopting them responsibly, taking care of its watershed, monitoring the quantity and quality of runoff, cleaning its margins, re-educating neighbors and the educational community and raising their awareness of this issue. Specific goals: • Establish ties at every educational level (from the earliest level to postgraduate courses) between public and private educational establishments. • Draw analogies between responsible pet care and surface waterbody stewardship. • Identify waterbodies with a high impact on different educational communities. • Propose that the watershed of these surface waterbodies be considered a territorial unit to perform responsible water resource stewardship and management. • Perform surveys, among other field activities, in the waterbody adopted by applying simple and advanced experimental techniques developed by the research team. • Together with the community, co-create knowledge to be shared with the rest of society and the agencies responsible for water resource management.

Description of citizen participation Students, jointly with the teaching staff and the research team, take part in the following activities: • Drawing analogies between responsible pet care and surface waterbody stewardship to enhance water appearance and quality. • Identifying waterbodies which are significant to the community and delineating its watershed. • Performing field activities (surveys, cleaning activities, thorough monitoring of water quality and quantity in the adopted waterbody by applying simple and advanced experimental techniques developed by the research team).
