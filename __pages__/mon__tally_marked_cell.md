> Brief description of the innovation

Brief Project Overview
The mono – tally marked cells have a number of applications in a realistic arena of the current dynamic link between student life and engineering sector; especially agriculture. The table as it appears fits user applications and very much user friendly. Below are a few of its basic functions.
Objectives :
•	To establish easy access to multiplication problems for any persons in need  
•	To provide ability to numerate any items in rows and columns without expert knowledge
•	To reduce number of students failing math at any level
•	To provide an attractive feature as push factor for  user   
•	To provide a tabulation of limitless numeration when working with figures
•	To provide a manual calculator

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation being a hypothesis not proved workable theorem to others, I would scale it rather an award than an income generating. This innovation will provide technical knowhow unlike physical manipulated equipment. Exam rooms exemplify setting where this innovation takes floor. ICT equipment are out of place here. this takes the room of a calculator, giving more students weak at math to pass. what a reduction on GCE rewriters and boost on their reserves spent

> Technical Feasibility

It is a design of a spread sheet or the common multiplication table and works almost within the limits of the two. The implementation plan proposed is its accuracy to determine posture of a plant on a farm or rather an item set along rows and columns. Its quick access to basic multiplication cannot be done away with. In agriculture, bumper harvest is result, while safe piling of food in bags is another.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation has greater impact on minds of my society. It trains anyone in interface the ability to fix basic multiplicative technic without struggling. Calculations can be done not minding much with calculators. It relevance is empowering self set calculator skill subduing frequent use of imported calculator. This means more money reserves in pocket.
