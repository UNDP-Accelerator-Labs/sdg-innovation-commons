Mfuwe Pulp and paper innovation

> Brief description of the innovation

As a young researcher based in a rural area, I have come to discover that in the swamps and rivers of Mfuwe there is an abundance of reeds and elephant grass which could be converted into usable pulp. I carried out a simple experiment on the samples of reeds and elephant grasses and determined the value and properties of the fibre and I was convinced that they were of good quality suitable for paper making. From the estimations made, I concluded that the elephant grass had an average fibre length of 1.75mm while the reed fibre proved somewhat  shorter shorter with fibre length of 1.5mm but overall they had excellent paper making properties. It is against this backdrop therefore that I would like to develop a scheme whose aim will be the commercial development of my territory's grass and reeds which will be anchored on sound economic principles.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Pulp has a wide variety of uses. It is the basic material in the manufacture of paper, card-board, fibre board, peppier Mache, plastics, lacquers, pressed containers, artificial silk, artificial leather, cellulose wadding, celluloid, cellophane and explosives. This wide range (of products)  naturally creates a vast demand for  pulp and it follows that production in meeting demand must be great. Local people will make money by supplying the local materials (reeds and grasses), others will be employed to operate the machines. Paper which will be manufactured, especially A4 in reams will be sold mostly locally since more than 95% of paper is imported. Other products to be made are exercise books to carter for the local demand. As a game management area, many local people will stop poaching and will concentrate on cutting reeds and grasses. The value addition of this innovation on the environment is that it will help to prevent wild fires which mostly destroy the habitat for wild animals. Instead of burning the reeds and grasses, they will be smoothly cut leaving room for quick sprouting/growing.

> Technical Feasibility

Based on the little investigation that I have done, the pulp and paper innovation in my area has the following implementation plan: (a) Production- a large out-put is necessary. The smallest economic unit likely to succeed is a plant designed for an ultimate production of 50 tons per day. (b) Cost of plant- such a plant would consist of buying a crusher and chipper, pulp dryer, black liquor recovery plant and a paper making machine. (c) Cost of processing materials-lime, water and electricity are readily available in the area.  The Ritter process will be used for the recovery of fibre in order to have a far reaching effect on the pulp and paper industry. This process is bio-chemical, consisting of the introduction of an organism to fibrous material. This organism attacks and digests the true cellulose fibre . It is possible, by this means to obtain a high quality alpha cellulose from almost all fibrous matter.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will impact positively on the social life of people in the area. As people gets employed and supply local materials, they will earn money which they will use to buy nutritious food, clothes and pay school fees for their children. People will also manage to pay for bills and build better houses.
