Warusi is brewed here in spring water for 4-6 hours over an open fire using firewood in a Bombay pot. Both the leaves and vines are brewed together in order to extract the juices. The pot is sitting on top of an outdoor concrete block/stone stovetop

One of the workers with a sackload of Warusi. Currently, the business is looking into setting up an organic farm of this herbal juice. For the time being, the worker goes into the forest and collects them since Warusi grows wild and in abundance.
