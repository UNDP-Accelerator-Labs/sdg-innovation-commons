> Title of the innovation

Helping people living with HIV to be on treatment.from the reports we have been receiving from the ministry of health it shows that only few people who are HIV positive are on treatment .

> Brief description of the innovation

I think we need to come up with ways to remove all the social mythes on ART and educate the people in rural area and urban areas about the importance of getting tested,being on treatment if found positive and being virally suppressed.
I believe if sensitization is done there will be a major improvement and will achieve or goal of zero new HIV infection.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Firstly we need to set up centres where people can be getting the ARV drugs and then employ people who can help in community mobilization and i believe there is an organization that has the same interests at heart they can help fund us and we will deliver.

> Technical Feasibility

We plan to work with the churches leaders, councilors and traditional leaders .we first educate the leaders and they will educate the communities or organization .
If they can't we come in and do the IEC 
And our other targets will be the chiefs and headmen

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will help in povarty eradication and improving the health of our clients because today we record more mother to child transmission of HIV and new infections because  people who have the virus are not on medication hence they infect others.
Or goal is to have clients who are virally suppressed.
And if people are virally suppressed it means they will have strength to work and provide for there familiesand we they will be be free from poverty.
