Care Work and Socioeconomic Inclusion of Women in Cambodia
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that women are continuing to take predominant roles in care work, which limit their ability to fully participate in the economy. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Despite steady economic growth, significant gender inequalities remain an issue in Cambodia, creating barriers to women’s equal participation in the cultural, economic, and political life of the country. As the country aspires to attain upper middle-income status by 2030, strengthening the socioeconomic inclusion of women will help ensure an equitable and prosperous future for the country.

While the rate of economic participation is high for both women and men, women are relatively taking more unpaid household responsibilities (UN Women &amp; BBC Media Action, 2020; Gender Equality in the Labor Market in Cambodia, ILO and ADB), which can therefore impact their ability to fully participate in society and the economy. This could be resulting in time poverty that prevents women from investing in themselves, their learning and profiting fully from economic opportunities. For example, time poverty among indigenous women in Cambodia may prevent them from being able to learn Khmer, an essential barrier to overcome to fully participate in Cambodia’s society and economy (Maffii &amp; Hong, 2010).

Women also disproportionately bear the burden of climate change. This pressure comes from many sources, such as local leaders who place the responsibility of families’ survival on women, particularly in the wake of a disaster (UN Women &amp; BBC Media Action, 2020). Women in communities affected by disasters report that they don’t have time to participate in the commune committee (Tanyag &amp; True, 2019).

The unpaid work gap for women is 3.5 hours per day, in contrast to men’s unpaid domestic work averaging to 18 minutes per day. In addition, unpaid family workers are more than twice as likely to be women as men and are in a particularly precarious situation, dependent on others in the household for any income (National Institute of Statistics, 2021).

Beliefs about the role of women in the household, and her duty to contribute to the family and internal household management, are deeply held by both men and women. Men and women accept a gendered division of labour, with men as the family breadwinner and women as mainly responsible for household management and childcare (UN Women &amp; BBC Media Action, 2020). Cambodian women are traditionally charged with overseeing their families’ finances (Southeast Asia Globe, 2018). In some communities, men migrate to look for economic opportunity, but women cannot do this, owing to gender norms about her duty to stay at home (UN Women &amp; BBC Media Action, 2020).

Women have limiting perceptions of themselves. For example, a higher percentage of women (compared to men) agreed that men make better political leaders than women. Older women, less educated women and women outside Phnom Penh are more likely to see their gender as an obstacle (CDRI, 2019). Women managers in green industries fear negative judgement for being assertive or self-confident (UNIDO &amp; UN Women, 2021).

Expectations of the ideal Khmer woman are also reinforced and negotiated in day-to-day interactions in households, communities, and workplaces. Women entrepreneurs face negative judgements by their family (54%), and community (71%) when starting their businesses (UNIDO &amp; UN Women, 2021).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Closing the gaps in gender equality and socioeconomic inclusion of women in Cambodia context is complex and requires a deep dive into the structural, cultural, behavioral, and mental barriers that women face. This can only be done by integrated approach as taken in this study including ethnography, behavioral insights, and systemic analysis.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Cambodia Accelerator Lab is working to unpack structural and behavioral barriers that hinder women from fully participating in the economy and propose interventions that can close the gaps and promote inclusive and sustainable development.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



1. What drives the gender disparity in care work responsibilities?

2. How can we foster women’s socioeconomic empowerment while balancing the care workload equitably?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



System thinking, in particular, the iceberg model will be used to unpack the mental model, belief, and assumptions, and structural barriers that underpin the gender inequality and exclusion. Participatory design will be used to collect and integrate multiple perspectives around the challenge. Horizon scanning will be used to scan for signals and trends impacting the challenge. Behavioral insights will be used to identify behavioral barriers and enablers for women's socioeconomic inclusion. Ethnography will be used to understand gendered and cultural barriers for women's socioeconomic inclusion.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Gender disaggregated data and intersectionality. These different types of data sources will help to answer the learning questions from a different angle and with multiple perspectives, ensuring comprehensive understanding of the challenge.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The findings of the study will be used to inform the portfolio and project design at the country office.
