Business caters mainly to the yachting and hotel industry by suppling environmentally friend customized personal care products such as sunscreen (which does not impact reefs), lotions, shampoos, face masks etc. Products are sold in bulk containers and the industry uses refillable plastic pouches that can be used up to 400 times before recycled in the national "we recycle" programme. Individual retail products are packaged in glass containers as much as possible. Locally sourced products include sargassum which is dried and used to make face powder, salt from the pond on Salt Island, papaya seeds (for facial scrub) and sugar cane for luffas. 25% of raw materials are locally sourced.
