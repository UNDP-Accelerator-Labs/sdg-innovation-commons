Power supply is an ongoing challenge for the telecom operators of Bangladesh as many of the remote areas are not connected to the national grid. In off-grid areas, diesel generators are used to source the required power which requires periodical refueling and frequent maintenance and are subject to fuel price hike. This in turn has forced operators to choose alternative energy solutions, especially solar power. To provide uninterrupted voice and data services, a number of operators have decided to run off-grid BTSs with solar-diesel hybrid power system. These systems use solar PV as primary power source and diesel generator as backup. So far IDCOL has financed 138 such solar-diesel hybrid power solutions in the telecom sector.
