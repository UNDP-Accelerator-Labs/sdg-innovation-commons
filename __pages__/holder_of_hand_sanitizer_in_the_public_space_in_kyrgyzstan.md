Holder of hand sanitizer in public spaces in Kyrgyzstan


This is a simple holder designed for the hand sanitizer. It is not clear who invented it and where. I first time noticed it in Bishkek airport. People can easily use their arm/elbow to push the bottle pump, instead of using their hand and/or using another part of the arm to touch the small pump of a sanitizer. Later, I see this in small business shops and at some public spaces. But it has not been widely adopted yet. 


P.S.: Later, I noticed that this device is manufactured by a company. We don't know this is the innovation of a business, or the grassroots innovation is adopted by business.
