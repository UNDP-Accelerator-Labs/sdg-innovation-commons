## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Deploying Value Addition processes to improve livelihoods and curb food wastage among Small-holder Farmers. 


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to determine if smallholder farmers' access to value addition equipment will improve their incomes and productivity by reducing post harvest waste and improving their livelihoods. 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Agriculture plays a vital role in creating employment to a high proportion of people in most developing countries, thus improving the livelihood of smallholder farmers. Globally, over 65% of the rural livelihoods who are economically active largely depend on the agricultural sector and in Benue State, Nigeria, small holder farmers are responsible for over 80% of the agricultural produce. These farmers record post-harvest losses of up to 50% on some crop lines due to limited infrastructure connections, inadequate access to markets, processing, and preservation facilities. These losses waste capital and labour expended on production all through the farming season and has a significant impact on local livelihoods as over 75% of the population engages in farming.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Lab in the process of sense making and exploration, employed collective intelligence to determine a solution to the challenge. This is a unique methodology found in Lab learnings. Resultantly, the Lab will work with new and unusual partners to build value addition equipment for clustered small holder farmers. due to the rising cost of fossil fuels in the country, the Lab is promoting the integration of renewable energy-powered equipment. 



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Accelerator Lab Nigeria targets small-holder farmers in benue state in a bid to reduce post-harvest losses by 30% of the volume of harvest typically lost and increase livelihoods on existing crop lines through value addition processes by 25%.
