## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Understanding the effects of surrounding spaces and environment on us as human, and if/how/to what extend they affect our behaviours, specifically in regards to the gender norms and roles.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If spatial changes were made in houses with negative gender exclusive spaces, then these interventions will positively change the behavior family members towards more equitable gender norms/roles

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Positive points to exploit and develop (Opportunities): The positive gendered spaces. Both the mother and the father contribute to the chores:  Focusing on the father (making him an icon and role model for the rest of (males) in the camp).  This will be done by:  - Rearranging the room of the eldest daughter so that two other daughters can be included in the same room. (Interior design)   - Solving the problem of the open to above court.   - Opening the kitchen to the living room.   - Placing a tea corner and a (mini-fridge) in the guest room. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

individuals, groups, and social interaction

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Shadowing of participants, in-depth interviews

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2.5 months implementation - 5 months waiting period - 1 month post assessment

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
