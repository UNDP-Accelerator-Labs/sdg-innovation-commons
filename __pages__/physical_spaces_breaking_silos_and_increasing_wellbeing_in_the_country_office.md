## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Isa Bergh Lopes da Costa

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

04.04.23

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Internal Challenge: Changing UNDP into a learning Organization (Communication within the Country Office)

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

UNDP as a Learning Organization 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How migth optimizing spaces in the CO for teamwork and collaboration change the way we work? Are physical and intellectual spaces linked?

  

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (Trial and erros, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)
- Experimental (Randomised assignment and/or control group)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

UNDP - This is an internal challenge focused on the UNDP Country Office 
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We would like to understand how physical and intellectual spaces are linked and if a collaboratively designed workspace equipped with tools for effective teamwork and collaboration exists within the CO, can alter teamwork, wellbeing and adoption of a portfolio approach.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF... a collaboratively designed workspace equipped with tools for effective teamwork and collaboration exists within the CO, THEN... the adoption of a portfolio approach to work will be streamelined and social interaction and wellbeing will increase.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Co-design and implement a collaborative space in the CO (an open transparent space with tools for team work and collaboration and greenery for wellbeing),  with the aim to break down silos in the office and streamline a Portfolio Approach way of working.

2. The space is inagurated and used by staff for 2 weeks

3. A pre-post survey is distributed to staff to measure wellbeing, team collaboration, 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1. User satisfaction

2. Easiness to collaborate in teams 

3. Availability of visualisation tools and how these tools facilitates work

4. Wellbeing

5. Social Interaction 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Pre-post perception survey with staff as well as observation of user interaction in the new space

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months (1 month of testing and 2 months of preparations and data analisys)

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

12 months 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The pre-post survey and observation surved the purpose. Next time it would have been interesting to compare different groups instead ex. the 3rd floor in the building (no access to collaborative spaces ) with th 4th floor (with access to collaborative spaces ).

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months (the construction work took longer than expected)

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

6580 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Due to the positive survey results, the DRR-O has advocated to scale up this activity and replicate it on the 3rd floor.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Due to the positive survey results, the DRR-O has advocated to scale up this activity and replicate it on the 3rd floor. Additionally, other agencies in the building (ex. RCO and UNICEF) has inspired by our prototype and has replicated it in their agencies.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Physical and intellectual spaces are connected!

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Slow procurement processes and delays in construction to getting the space ready for use.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Everyone at UNDP as it proved to change the way we work.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Companies ad International organizations who aims to break silos within their offices 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We adjusted design and layout of the room together with colleagues along the way.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Make sure to get everyone in the office on board during the design phase to avoid conflicts. Ex. we did not consult all colleagues during the process and some of them were upset as the new space affected their workspace.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

I beleive it can be replicated in any area of the SDGs where one wants to enhance collaboration among users of a space.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The experiment builds on previous insights from the sense and explore phase of our Internal Challenge.

> What surprised you?

How the new space changed the behaviour of staff and broke down silos.
