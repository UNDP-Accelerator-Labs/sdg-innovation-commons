Recycle Jar Ecosystems is a Social Enterprise that aims to tackle the issue of waste from many angles. They have found that nearly everything people use can be recycled and collect typically non-recyclable items through national, first-of-their-kind recycling and reuse platforms. Recycle Jar utilizes an ultra hyper-local model and collects fast and cheap unused used, damaged items to the customers all over Dhaka and later on nationwide. Reverse Commerce is going to be a new era of the waste management ecosystem. Their goal is to reduce people's carbon footprint as much as possible.  Recycle Jar Ecosystem provides a market platform where anyone can sell their household waste. These can range from used plastic, electronics, cooking oil, paper, cardboard etc. Essentially the Recycle Jar Ecosystem works as a middleman, connecting interested sellers with recyclers. Prospective sellers can access Recycle Jar's website and instantly make their sales. They can also calculate their carbon output using the site's own carbon footprint calculator. To date, the Recycle Jar Ecosystem has increased the income of around 6,000 households while reducing CO2 emissions by 66 tons. They have also redistributed more than 61,000 items. The business model is the sharing economy model in which an entrepreneur is able to execute any selling request by the customers. This model is for the benefit of those customers who do not have time for selling their waste/unused items. This model is appealing to consumers interested in sustainability as well. By cutting down on excessive spending, they are ultimately reducing their environmental footprint and also earning money.
