## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Smart Cities Portfolio
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that urban extremely interwoven issues are in dire need of putting undeserved people in the very center of urban design in the most innovative and connected way.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce? We have been developing a line of work on Green and SDG bonds and others innovative SDG finance ways and at the same time, we have been growing a number of experiments meant to jet pulse the local inclusive digital economy. All of which are still running and lay interesting and useful links for using innovative technologies to future-proof smart cities. When the CO asked that we take part in drafting a future smart cities comprehensive offerings, we made sure this will be intertwined with ongoing experiments that are running as part of our Labs' other scopes of work namely financial and digital inclusions and SDG finance.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Water management is topping the national priorities in the most pressing ways: the Moroccan government issued a water crisis warrant in February 2022 and is bracing for the worst drought in 30 years. Morocco’s water crisis doubled down ever since  this year’s rainfall reached a record low in a very much rainfall-dependent economy while the groundwater over depletion and water-stress conditions are getting worse (with less than 1,667 m 3 /capita/year). This adds to the growing concerns resulting from semiarid climate and persistent drought urban and rural regions to make water management and urban innovation one of Morocco’s most complex challenges.  https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/catastrophic-moroccan-drought-boost-import-subsidy-costs-2022-02-18/

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The unique smart urban innovation portfolio we are developing tackles challenges as distinct as water management, gender sensitive mobility and funding the SDG in an unusually intertwined way. We convene between a variety of stakeholders to co-design open sourced digital solutions. However, most of the value we bring to the process resides in bringing the human to tech and going through multiple layers of consultations.   

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

To design a future proof response to the water crisis, gender mobility and other urban challenges, Accelerator Lab Morocco is taking on an open source and collective intelligence approach to smart urban innovation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

  1.       How can UNDP smart cities toolkit help optimize water consumption in locale cities? 2.       How can we re-imagine public space design catered to women mobility needs? 3.       How can local cities co-design IOT citizen centric solutions using Fiware open-source integrated platform? 4.       How can we design an open-source start village simulator?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

open source interoperable digital solutions, skilling, blended finance, multistakeholder partnerships, and good governance.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Exploring alternative sources to water security is data intensive while Moroccan cities are data scarce.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The ongoing smart cities potfolio will be considered for future collaborations with more cities as planned early on by the CO.
