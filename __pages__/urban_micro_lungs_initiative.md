Urban development

> Description of the solution

The Urban Micro-Lungs (UML) initiative in East Amman, Jordan, funded by the German Federal Ministry and implemented by GIZ in partnership with local entities, introduces urban micro-forests using the Miyawaki Method to combat urban densification and climate change effects. This green infrastructure project enhances air quality, reduces water runoff, and supports local biodiversity, all while involving the community in beautification efforts. It serves as a replicable model for urban greening, emphasizing low-maintenance, drought-tolerant native plants and participatory approaches for sustainable urban development.
