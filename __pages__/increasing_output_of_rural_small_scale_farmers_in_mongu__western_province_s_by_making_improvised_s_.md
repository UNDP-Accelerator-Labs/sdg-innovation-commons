> Title of the innovation

Increasing output of rural small scale farmers in Mongu, Western Province's by making improvised seed accessible to them

> Brief description of the innovation

Bringing improved farming inputs closer to rural small scale farmers in Mongu through conviently placed kiosks in their communities to help increase output and fight off hunger

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Often times people living in rural parts of the country are excluded from taking part in economic activities that could better thier lively hoods through unavailability of products and services, my research recognized this gap in my community therefore the innovation will generate income for me through the sale of the farming inputs in hard to reach areas therefore making it possible for the rural farmers to mover away from sustistance farming and grown into commercial farmers aswel as they begin to produce more than enough for their consumption, this will also fight of malnutrituon in the rural areas. The prize money would help purchase a truck to transport the inputs in remote places as well as to set up kiosks where the farming inputs would be sol, the innovation would also employ locally creating another form of earning an income for some locals.
The value addition of the innovation to the environment would be safer farming practices that do not harm the environment such as use of harmful fertilizers

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation works by linking the rural areas to urban supply through the use of conviently placed kiosks stocked up with all the improved farming inputs therefore eliminating the distance that makes it a barrier to find access these products.
A pilot would be carried out on 100 rural small scare farmers in one farming season to see how their output would be in comparison to those who would not have access to the improved seed with view of expansion

> Anticipated Social Impact

The main economic activity is rural areas is farming, if rural farmers would have easier access to the farming inputs they need to yield more output it would be a step close to their inclusiveness in the economy as they so would eventually reach levels where they produce enough not only for their consumption but also to trade in urban areas. Currently, there is a huge gap to be filled in the agricultural sector if  small scale farmers would be able to  grow more they could help increase food security
