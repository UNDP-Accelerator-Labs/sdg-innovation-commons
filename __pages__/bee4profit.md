> Title of the innovation

Bee4Profit

> Brief description of the innovation

Bee4Profit is a community development initiative empowering rural based bee farmers with the needed resources to practice sustainable bee farming, to increase incomes, reduce dependence on natural resources and improve biodiversity in forest environment. We aim to set up an outgrower scheme in mbala district northern province with a provision of 1000 low cost concrete beehives with an average production of 50kg to 75kg per hive producing organic certified honey for the local and export market . The farmers will have hands training in bee hive management and comb honey harvesting . Our model will incorporate 70% of hands on learning experience.20% learning from others and 10% guided training experience.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our business seeks to setup a bee farm producing 100%pure, ethically sourced high quality honey and it’s by products. We will utilize the use of outgrower farmers to increase our production capacity this in turn offer a traceable social economic foot print to rural farmers.our small holder farmers will produce high value honey we will offtake. This will increase and commercially scale the honey production from 7.5tons in year 1 to 2500tons per season by year 5.cost of production of honey is $724 per ton with expected sales of about $22,952 in year one. The product is for export market in airtight squeeze bottles and glass jars and to cover the bottom of the pyramid all the way to top tier local market in Peri urban and hospitality industry. Our concrete beehives use less wood which is helps save pristine forests as opposed to the traditional wooden hives.

> Technical Feasibility

Based on the langstroth beekeeping system the concrete bee bunka produced by Beegin is a standardized, efficient and highly productive hive. Made from lightweight concrete mixture with steel-reinforced,these concrete beehives are resistant to theft, vandalism, pests, fires, harsh weather and badgers.the business is at the pilot stage with the following actives in progress. Company registration and other formalities, site selection with edosement letter from the chief in mbala completed. In year one we aim to have installed 100 concrete beehives at our farm. With a production output of 7.5tons at the end of year 1. In year two we aim to have trained 50farmers for our outgrower system equipped with 10 beehives each which bring our installed capacity of hives to 600. Production output of 37.5 tons from farmers and 7.5tons from our farm

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will engage the rural farmers in entrepreneurship, operations and management training.Addressing poverty, particularly in rural areas, is one of the main challenges facing the Zambian government. Currently rural headcount stands at about 77 percent(CSO, 2016), with women making up 64 percent of the rural population and approximately 80percent of food producers. The poverty levels in rural setups have led to over 50 percent of the youth aged 20-24 year migrating from rural to urban areas in search for alternative non-farm jobs(Iapri,2019). Bee4profit recognizes that the most vulnerable population in rural areas is our women and youths. Beekeeping is not labor intensive and gender sensitive, making it suitable for women to get actively involved. This in turn increases income, the well-being of the family as well as the self-esteem of women and youths.
