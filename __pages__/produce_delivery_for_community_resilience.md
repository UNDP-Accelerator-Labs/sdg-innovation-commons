The COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease of economic activity in Sleman, Yogyakarta. Due to the measures taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, buying and selling activity at local markets came to a standstill, as many people were no longer able to freely visit the marketplace. Sayur Sleman, a local small enterprise, was established in response to these conditions. This startup offered vegetable delivery services, acting as a middleman connecting market vendors and households in need of fresh produce. The communication between customers and the service took place through digital means such as WhatsApp and social media apps. In addition, Sayur Sleman launched an alms-giving program, distributing free produce to people in need as a way to give back to the community, as well as a program to teach farming and entrepreneurial skills to locals. The activities of Sayur Sleman demonstrate the impact that digitalization and MSME development can have towards building community resilience.
