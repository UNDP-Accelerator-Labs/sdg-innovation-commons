WasteLess is a social enterprise based in India that works with school students in bringing behavior change around responsible consumption and proper disposal of waste, especially plastic waste. Garbology 101 and kNOw PLASTICS are two of the flagship programs designed and run by WasteLess. Garbology 101 is a set of interactive games and activities divided into 6 different themes, each providing a unique perspective on the generation and responsible management of waste. These themes work as lenses through which students can critically and holistically analyze the issue of waste. Through these programs, students understand different ways of understanding the waste problem and role children can play in solving this problem.  kNOw PLASTIC is designed exclusively for children to understand different kinds of plastics that make up the waste and how different kinds of plastics can be up or recycled.  Both these games use behavior change approach and are user centric. They also include instructions guide for teachers/ facilitators to run these games and design their waste management education sessions.
