> Qualitative Results of the Innovation Solution 


1. Increased productivity: Farmers who have adopted the new technologies and practices promoted by Daraja and Twaweza have reported increased yields and reduced production costs.
2. Increased income: Farmers who have improved their productivity have also seen an increase in their income. For example, some farmers who have adopted greenhouse farming have reported up to four times the income they earned from traditional farming methods.
 3. Improved nutrition: The promotion of nutrient-rich crops has led to improved nutrition among vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.
4.b The promotion of climate-smart agriculture practices helps farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change and maintain their livelihoods.

> Quantitative Result of the Innovation

1. Increased crop yields: By promoting sustainable agriculture practices such as conservation agriculture, crop rotation, and use of improved seeds, Daraja Twaweza may have helped farmers in East Africa increase their crop yields. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sustainable agriculture practices can increase crop yields by 79% on average.
2.  Increased income: By promoting sustainable agriculture practices and providing farmers with training and access to markets, Daraja Twaweza may have helped increase the income of farmers in East Africa. According to a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), sustainable agriculture practices can increase farmers' income by up to 35%.
3. Improved soil health: Sustainable agriculture practices promoted by Daraja Twaweza may have helped improve soil health in East Africa. According to the FAO, sustainable agriculture practices can help improve soil fertility, reduce soil erosion, and increase the soil's capacity to hold water and nutrients.
