## 

Despatronados is the Portuguese (Spanish) word to  "Boss-less". This is a powerful solution to exploitation, precarity, unsafe work in delivery jobs such as Uber, Glovo, etc.


Delivery workers in Río de Janeiro, Brazil got together to organize themselves into a delivery cooperative with no hiearchies and fair pay. Their work is not mediated by an app, but instead they have decided to build a network together with clients based on trust. "From workers to workers". https://despatronados.wixsite.com/cooperativa?fbclid=IwAR09v1eFlnMwRkt9Zr8hEdnWmHve5OCeFjr2NLTPCXYGd9Uw_0h9bDY58sM
