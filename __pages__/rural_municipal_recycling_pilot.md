## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

·         How long does it take a rural municipality to collect sufficient recyclable material for the initiative to be financially sustainable?

 

·         Can rural municipalities run a financially sustainable recycling program through the establishment of a collection center with a compacting machine?

The specific learning intent is to understand whether private industry, government and civil society can collectively sustain a recycling program that is financially viable with the establishment of a collection center and compacting machine.

 

Phase 1 of the experiment seeks to understand whether: 1) sufficient volume can be generated from the community of Cambutal to offset the cost of transporting the recycled material to a central hub and 2) whether the material can be compacted in an adequate manner to be transported by Coca Cola trucks (inverse logistics). 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF Cambutal can successfully implement a municipal recycling project and divert a progressive 8 tons of recyclable material from the municipal landfill, THEN the lab can pilot an inverse logistics experiment with Coca Cola (they would be responsible for transporting the recyclable material) for a financially sustainable closed-loop recycling program.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Actions for the first phase are divided into four categories:

 

(1)    Separation and collection from the source (businesses)

(2)    Collection center

(3)    Establishment of value chain

(4)    Evaluate and expand
