> Title of the innovation

Goal chasers

> Brief description of the innovation

The Goal chasers group, is a group of former classmate who have come up with a program to help raise money and keep each other occupied so as we don't fall prey to vices. The group recently has been raising goats and when they become a lot the goats would be taken to kasumbalesa for sale. Our hope is to raise money so we can expand the business to involve poultry and build up a shop where we can be selling the products. Currently in the district, no people are involved in the production of eggs and those involved in poultry just have broilers not layers. It's hope to expand it to that extent so that we can provide eggs to our local people and other daily products as the innovation grows

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation is aimed at producing poultry products and other daily products as it grows. The selling of these products will enable us generate income for our group. The income will help us expand the business and also keep us motivated to explore other fields. The innovation also aims at doing agriculture, growing tomatoes and other vegetables. 
Currently most of the youths in the area have been taking up the cutting of trees to produce charcoal for sale due to lack of employment. Our group aims to employ some of these youths so that they help in the processes and cut on the deforestation currently taking place. Also the youths are found abusing lots of bad vices, which is mainly due to lack of what to do. Having us doing this will motivate others to do the same. In terms of knowledge to do this, some of my group members did obtain qualifications at ZIA in mazabuka and the other mate is currently doing his vet medicine at the University of Zambia. And at the end of the year, we all meet and knowledge of how to do all this can easily be shared.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation aims at providing poultry products, agricultural products and other daily products to the local people. We saw a need for this. Land for implementation of this plan is readily available, the challenge has been raising funds for buying of especially chicks for this start up and building up the needed standard poultry buildings and other expenses. 
If funds can be generated, the aim will be to build up a small place for all this and buy the chicks or the at point of lay layers so as we can start. The food also will be bought. This plan is a self paying plan, the only difficult part is the starting up. When eggs and other products will be sold, there will be generation of funds for running of this program on its own.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Creating jobs for over youths, motivation for other youths to do other productive work than abusing drugs, supply of products to the people and also cut on deforestation and over fishing. 
The market currently is good. As of now, no group has come up with this idea in the community. The people who sale most of these products we intend to produce buy them outside our district. Thus this provision will cut on that and as we grow, will be able to expand and sale to other districts or towns.
