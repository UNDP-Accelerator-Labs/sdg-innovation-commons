MAINSTREAMING THROUGH COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to ensure an innovative angle to Ukraine's UNDP country
programme as well as the internal capacity to anticipate and adapt to emerging
trends, embrace experimental ways of working, and forge partnerships that
promote transformative change while supporting Ukraine and its citizens who
face complex challenges in recovery, sustainable development, and achieving EU
accession goals, amplified by the ongoing war and economic disruptions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Gender-Based Violence (GBV) remains a pressing issue in Ukraine, as it does globally, affecting millions of women, men, and children. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated vulnerabilities, especially among displaced
populations, contributing to increased risks of GBV. Public transportation areas are particularly susceptible to harassment, assault, and other violent acts due to the large number of people and the relative anonymity they offer.

UNDP seeks to understand how safety and security are perceived in public transport.

This concept outlines a comprehensive and multifaceted GBV prevention campaign targeting public transport users, designed to raise awareness, promote behavioral change, and enhance safety in both intercity and urban transport environments.

the cost to
humanity of the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine has been vast[1].
Around 24,862 civilian deaths[2].  Over 3,67 million refugees have fled across
Europe[3].
6,5 mln. of Ukrainian refugees, 3,7 mln. of internally displaced persons, 2 mln
households were affected by damaged or destroyed housing, a fivefold increase
in poverty to 24,1% - up from 5,5%[4].

context is characterized by a dynamic yet challenging environment where social
and green transformations are critical for sustainable development.





 





According to a comprehensive UNDP-led Human Impact Assessment[1],
the war in Ukraine has significantly affected social inclusion Impact of the War on Social Inclusion and Vulnerable Groups. Around 45% of the population now belongs to at least one vulnerable group, such as internally displaced persons (IDPs), persons with disabilities (PWDs), and older persons. These groups have experienced the lowest income levels and face discrimination, especially in seeking employment or
accommodation. The assessment also highlights severe challenges related to gender equality, with 3.6 million people at risk of gender-based violence. About 55% of women reported feeling unsafe in their daily lives, and a significant number of women are burdened with unpaid domestic work, spending over 50 hours per week on chores​.

A 2023 assessment on sexual violence completed by JURFEM, noted that 59% of participants surveyed reported experiencing sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Of the women who experienced sexual violence, 71% experienced sexual violence in the workplace, 35% on public transport, and 24% at home. The GBV AoR estimates that there are 2.5 million people in Ukraine in need of GBV assistance.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?







The Accelerator Lab's unique position within UNDP Ukraine allows it to act as a catalyst for innovative, community-led initiatives that address both environmental and social challenges. By leveraging its expertise in innovation methods, such as participatory design, co-creation, and systems thinking, the Lab can effectively support communities in scaling their green and social innovation projects. The Lab's ability to connect local initiatives with international best practices and funding opportunities further strengthens its role as a key player in promoting sustainable recovery and social inclusion amidst Ukraine's EU accession journey. Our focus on engaging diverse community groups, including women and youth, ensures a comprehensive approach that aligns with both local needs and broader development goals.




A GBV prevention campaign in Ukraine's public transport is an urgent and necessary intervention to address the growing threat of violence in public spaces. By educating the public, empowering survivors, and fostering
a culture of intervention and accountability, this campaign can make meaningful strides toward reducing GBV and ensuring safer urban environments for everyone.

UNDP would like to learn what new approaches would be efficient to for creating a cultural shift that promotes respect, safety, and dignity in Ukraine’s public spaces.




Through learning, UNDP aims to foster a culture of safety, respect, and vigilance within the railway and metro systems, making them safer spaces for all passengers, particularly women and girls.
