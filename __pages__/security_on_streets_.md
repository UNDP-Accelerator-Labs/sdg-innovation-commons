Security on streets! 

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Since certain neighborhoods in Guatemala City, are threatened by car thieves, particular persons in an informal way have managed to provide "a security service" in a spontaneous way. Most of them tend to be very friendly and get to know the people that demand parking space on streets. In exchange they accept an open fee (what the car user wants to pay them). This is one of the successful "eyes on the street" practice. However,  there are other cases of this type of "guards" that demand higher cost or a fixed fee as you park or otherwise they become the threat against the user and his/her car . This is Mr. Dionicio Xante Ca, he comes from zone 8 and the neighborhood he is guarding is San Ignacio in zone 10 in Guatemala City.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Security on the streets, people in an informal way have managed to provide this service as street guards in particular neighborhoods. 

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Spontaneous way of solving problems. No central o local government is present, but it can be solved in a practical way. People from other neighborhoods come to provide the service in demanded areas. They have this sort of mental map where action is (potential threats and visitors / plus the users and visitors map).
