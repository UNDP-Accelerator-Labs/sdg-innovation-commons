Problem being solved? Pollution and waste due to feminine personal hygiene and sexual education
This project locally produces and distributes cloth menstrual pads as an eco-friendly alternative to disposable menstrual products, as well as engaging in sexual and reproductive health education.

What's the solution?
In 2018, Amy Li Baksh embarked on her own eco-friendly/reusable journey and went looking for locally made reusable products. She couldn't find any. Recognizing that this was a huge hole in our local market and wanting to create a product that could help solve the issue of plastic waste she began experimenting with hand-made, cloth sanitary pads for women. She also realized that to get women to use them she would have to fill some of the gaps in our local education when it comes to sexual and reproductive health. She also designs the fabric prints used for the pads since she felt Caribbean artwork was the best way to make an unfamiliar product seem less intimidating and to give persons who menstruate a positive and beautiful connection to their periods rather than the clinical white products they are used to using.



"I would like to change the local culture of menstrual product use not only in Trinidad and Tobago but across the Caribbean. Ideally I want to reach the most underserved communities rather than only engaging with communities already privileged with access to education and funding. I am currently limited by the small production team (myself and one other person) as well as pandemic-related issues with shipping in some of the fabric I use that is not currently available locally."

Future of the Innovation and Future Prospects
Accessing the female prisons where there is a shortage of sanitary pads. Also a widespread distribution system so that pads can be sent to persons across the Caribbean, as well as opportunities to engage with marginalized communities and do educational workshops on sexual and reproductive health.
