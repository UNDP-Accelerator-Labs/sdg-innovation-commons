## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. False information poses a significant challenge in Jordan, with various motivations for sharing false or unverified information on social media platforms.

2. The consequences of false Information can be real and far-reaching, as seen in the case of vaccination hesitancy in Jordan, and it erodes trust in reliable sources and institutions.

3. Addressing false information requires a multifaceted approach, including research, data analysis, and tailored solutions that consider local contexts and sentiments.

4. The UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab is actively working on innovative solutions to combat false information, utilizing machine learning, primary research, and other methods to better understand and address the issue in Jordan.

We collected and analysed more than 500 K tweets from Jordan using an AI model to categorise the data into topics and label them if they had misinformation, hate speech, or luring. We are currently doing a manual check on a sample of the tweets to test the analysis and get a thematic analysis of the tweets.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We are exploring different data sets of false information that includes utilizing Ai algorithms to identify patterns of false information on Twitter. We are also using qualitative surveys to capture insights on false information in different locations in the country.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Our method involves a combination of AI analysis, manual thematic analysis, and primary research, allowing for a holistic understanding of the false information landscape. This approach considers the quantitative aspects (data-driven analysis) and qualitative aspects (insights from primary research), providing a more nuanced and comprehensive perspective.
