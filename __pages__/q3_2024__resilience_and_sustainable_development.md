Q3 2024– Resilience and Sustainable development 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to foster capacity building for resilience in the face of escalating socio-environmental challenges while promoting an understanding of the pivotal role of local knowledge, people experiences, and young leaders that take action. By learning from resilience strategies of different groups, local knowledge and trajectories that led to actions emphasizing youth activism and local knowledge, we aim to identify life trajectories and collective experiences and leverage local experiences, resources, and knowledge. Our R&amp;D portfolio presents a capacity-centered narrative focused on adaptation and actionable solutions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



 In a complex and uncertain world, building resilience by fostering ties of solidarity based on a shared vision emerges as a key action, as UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner emphasized, when discussing the findings on the increasing sense of global insecurity, despite advancements in development (UNDP, 2022b). Moreover, the 2021/2022 Human Development Report reinforces this message, highlighting the interdependence between people and the planet, and the critical role of solidarity in building resilience (UNDP, 2022a). 

 

Citizen participation and activism are crucial aspects of fostering grassroot solidarity and community action. Since 2023, the AccLab has actively engaged young socio-environmental activists.  To gain a deeper understanding of how to promote sustainable development, UNDP's Acceleration Lab in Argentina, the Co_Lab, began complementary research to the study from the Human Development and Policy Area.  Through a qualitative methodological strategy, we have conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of young people and young adult socio-environmental activists, women and men, aged 18-37. 

The insights gathered from this research have informed several key initiatives: 

- We contributed a section to the "Environmental Action: Beliefs, Expectations, and Citizen Participation" report, highlighting the perspectives of young socio-environmental activists in Argentina. 

- Our research findings were also shared as inputs for the UN's Common Country Analysis (CCA) document, which serves as a foundational tool for the UN’s work in Argentina. 

- In collaboration with the UNDP Environment Cluster, the  United Nations Resident Coordinator Office, and UNDP Argentina Human Development and Policy Area, we organized a workshop for youth and specialists. This workshop aimed to bridge the gap between research and practice, fostering dialogue and co-creating solutions to the challenges identified in our study. 

- We published a blog post to disseminate our research findings more widely and are preparing a document that compiles and analyses the data gathered during our study. 

 

Building capacity for resilience extends to empowering affected populations through the recognition and utilization of local knowledge. Communities possess valuable insight into their environments and the potential solutions these environments offer in times of crisis (UNDP, 2022a). Collective intelligence, fostering the open and structured exchange of ideas, presents a significant opportunity to recover and share this knowledge. This collaborative approach can promote enabling conditions for building resilience.  

 

Besides, the active participation of local communities is essential to designing innovative solutions to address socio-environmental challenges. These communities possess a unique understanding of their environments, which is essential for comprehending the specific effects of various threats. Furthermore, their engagement significantly enhances the efficiency of resilience programs by enabling the development of customized solutions tailored to local needs. In this regard, the AccLab, in alliance with the Uruguay River Binational Project and local authorities of the Argentine city of Concepción, implemented a collective intelligence initiative. This initiative fostered knowledge sharing to develop action plans for the protection of native plants and the eradication of invasive species. 

 

This initiative exemplifies the importance of citizen participation, local knowledge and resilience building portfolio. These collective intelligence exercises, designed to develop action plans, also foster empathy, mutual understanding, and community engagement all aligning with the initiative’s goal. It represents a practical application of citizen participation through the sharing of local knowledge and the collaborative development of action plans. Thus, in this way, the initiative directly addresses key aspects of our approach, namely, citizen activism and grassroots knowledge. The initiative’s first iteration involved local officials, academics, and residents. To broaden its reach, it was subsequently implemented in Colón, another city within the province of Entre Ríos, as part of the National Craft Fair (Fiesta Nacional de la Artesanía). There, a join team from the Binational Project and the Municipality of Colón shared the initiative’s activities and materials with fair attendees. 

 

In the context of building resilience, the Latin America and Caribbean Bureau (RBLAC) set out to analyze the links between risk, individual resilience and human development, to identify how personal experiences and coping mechanisms contribute to the ability of individuals to adapt to the economic, social, environmental and governance challenges that exist in each region of Latin America and the Caribbean. From Argentina, we contributed to this research by conducting 18 in-depth interviews. We have interviewed, transcribed, and are currently systematizing the information.

The complex interplay of various insecurity factors is becoming more evident. Around the globe, communities are grappling with several disruptions, including declining agricultural productivity, intensified droughts, heatwaves, floods, food sources reduction, and cyclones (UNDP, 2022a).  Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused widespread human development setbacks and continues to pose challenges due to unpredictable variants. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and conflicts in Ukraine and other regions exacerbate existing humanitarian crises within a strained multilateral landscape (UNDP, 2022a). 

 

These acute crises are giving way to chronic, interconnected uncertainties on a global scale, creating a sense of unsettled lives and an uncertain future (2022a) [Figure 1]. Consequently, feelings of insecurity are rising across the globe [Figure 2].

Resilience refers to the capacity of communities to draw on their experiences, resources, and knowledge to overcome challenges. 

 

Recognizing the critical importance of resilience, the UNDP's 2022-2025 Strategic Plan emphasizes supporting countries and communities in building resilience and enhancing their recovery capabilities as core Signature Solution. In addressing the interconnected uncertainties impacting people globally, UNDP calls for solidarity as a key principle. Distrust, polarization and tendencies towards extremism, which are often associated with insecurity, can significantly weaken resilience (UNDP, 2022a, p. 52). These factors erode social consensus, weaken institutions, and undermine visions of a shared future, thereby hindering collective action and the sustainability of resilience strategies. 

 

Our research on young socio-environmental activists in Latin America reveals a multidimensional approach to sustainable development. In addition, this movement integrates socio-environmental issues with personal experiences and emotions, as well as local issues. 

 

In fact, initial results of our qualitative field research show how young adults and adolescents linked their interest in sustainable development causes to different situations. Firstly, non-formal education appears as a catalyst because it enables children and young people to the extent that it allowed them to carry out activities outside the classroom that they enjoy, in which they can actively participate and interact with others, and which end up being very important in their careers. Second, outdoor experiences that brought them closer to nature and allowed them to enjoy and appreciate it. Third, travel and exchanges as transformative experiences. Fourthly, cultural consumption, with documentaries available on different platforms standing out.  This process of engagement tends to unfold progressively. Even though these situations are diverse, they often have a common denominator: It is an experience that helps them understand that they are part of an interconnected whole and that includes nature and human actions. 

 

 

Despite its relevance, the interviewees also acknowledge that socio-environmental issues are excluded from the national public agenda since other issues always seem to be a priority.  For example, wildfires, floods, or droughts are mentioned when they occur and their negative impacts are recorded, but there is no evidence of any sort of discussion of medium-term goals. To promote conversation on these topics, the youth emphasize the importance of developing narratives and deploying communication strategies that do not imply an apocalyptic vision of the future to avoid feelings of inaction. The reasoning is simple: If everything is lost and nothing can be changed, the fight to promote sustainable development and the possibility of causing transformations is meaningless. Hence, there is broad agreement that the messages “should be positive” and that the movement must formulate proposals in dialogue and collaboration with other stakeholders. 

 

Moreover, young people believe it is strategic to adopt a socio-environmental perspective in which environmental issues are related to development through social inclusion. They often argue that the climate crisis and social inequality are closely related, given that the most affected people are, at the same time, living in vulnerable conditions. To this end, they recognize the need to collaborate with social movements and the people most exposed to the risks of environmental impacts. For the movement to grow, we need to support intersectoral dialogues where the development model of the country is discussed. This process implies, in turn, establishing mutual trust among different stakeholders. 

 

As mentioned above, together with youth activism, grassroots knowledge is another pivotal point of our approach to this challenge. In this sense the results from the native plants workshop organized with populations of riverside areas allowed us to identify grassroot leaders with different types of knowledge and open an instance of collective intelligence to foster collaboration and mutual nurturing and understanding. Attention to grassroot knowledge is not separated from citizen activism and is related to the importance of the involvement of local populations as crucial strategy for building resilience in face of environmental challenges.  These communities involvement in designing and developing solutions to socio-environment challenges is also essential. Being the most affected while also being agents of adaptation, their participation in decision-making is vital. This “deep participation” process ensures that the decisions made reflect local needs and knowledge.  

 

Additionally, on the one hand, the attention to grassroot knowledge results in prioritizing the needs of the communities and, on the other, it becomes an opportunity to leverage what people have already been doing so that the interventions align with their approach and the resulting actions remain somehow familiar to them. This is why integrating this local knowledge with existing practices enhances the effectiveness of sustainable adaptation strategies. By doing so, the solutions developed are tailored to the specific needs of each community, bringing a more efficient and sustainable response. 

Results show that grassroots leaders would like to have more native plants in the city, aiming to build a local identity that highlights their cultural heritage. They wish to have more native plants available in commercial nurseries, as well as having them promoted in schools and used in public tree planting and reforestation efforts. They have also proposed municipal regulations and policies for the preservation and support of native plants.  

  

They have identified several opportunities for achieving these objectives, including the presence of relevant individuals and artistic movements while working on the awareness of the negative consequences of the agricultural food system on native plants. The richness and ecological diversity of the forest, the potential for tourism, and the possibility of leveraging the Uruguay River as a biological corridor have been highlighted as positive outcomes. Additionally, a new urban planning code and state budget for reforestation were noted as facilitators for incorporating native plants.  

  

Threads and obstacles identified were primarily cultural, economic, and awareness related. These included prioritizing commercial logic over common goods, lack of access to land, and state support for creating natural reserves. There was also a general lack of knowledge and awareness about native species, as well as cultural practices and beliefs that threaten native flora, such as equating native plants to "weeds" and patriarchal domination over species.  

  

Lastly, participants proposed short-term actions to realize their wishes, such as designating individuals responsible for overseeing native species in public spaces, adopting trees, offering tax exemptions for planting natives, organizing challenges, promoting eco-tourism, and creating natural reserves through public-private collaboration. They have also suggested a phased approach for awareness and education, creating a municipal nursery for native plants, and organizing the territory to enhance biological corridors along the coastal municipalities of the Uruguay River, backed by an environmental land-use law. 

 

On the other hand, the research line aimed at providing inputs for the regional human development index shows that we are living a world increasingly marked by complexity and insecurity, particularly in Argentina, where economic instability creates widespread uncertainty. As a result, the concerns of the interviewees often revolve around financial survival and the search for greater stability across various aspects of life. Independence—both economic and personal—is a shared aspiration, closely tied to education and employment. While interviewees may not use the term resilience, since it has not been explicitly mentioned, it is a central theme in the strategies people use to pursue well-being. The key dimensions of well-being include health—especially mental health, the development of healthy habits, and engaging in fulfilling activities—and family, social relationships, and mutual support. Well-being, therefore, is understood as an integrated state balancing emotional, mental, physical, and economic health. 

Risk, fear, and uncertainty have significant impacts on emotional and mental health. Testimonies emphasize two key factors: socio-economic challenges and citizen insecurity. Both act as barriers to well-being, undermining trust in public institutions and government policies. These issues also highlight a sense of vulnerability and fear of rising social conflict linked to poverty and economic crises. While risk is often associated with loss, fieldwork also reveals a more hopeful perspective, where risk is seen as an opportunity for growth and achieving meaningful goals, often linked to courage, creativity, and entrepreneurship. 

The COVID-19 pandemic was a turning point that reshaped relationships, work, and communication. Digitalization accelerated rapidly, and fears related to health, contagion, and economic stability took hold. Both personal and professional relationships were disrupted, leading to feelings of disconnection. Many criticized the restrictions, seeing them as excessive and overly limiting personal freedoms. In response, individuals adapted by reorganizing tasks and relying on community support. 

Concerns extend beyond economic insecurity and crime to governance issues. While democratic values are supported and ideals are respected, there is frustration with , interviewees express their frustration with government’s performance, particularly regarding how poorly the state has addressed citizens' needs. This disconnection between political leaders and the realities of the population has led to a perception that democracy no longer truly represents the people. However, this cyclical pattern of crisis is also seen as an opportunity for resilience, as people trust in their ability to adapt and overcome, as they have in the past. 

The adaptive strategies people use to build resilience are based on experiential knowledge and are deeply connected to the pursuit of well-being. Four main themes emerge from the analysis: the importance of mental health, the challenges and potentials of digitalization, community-based responses to adversity, and the crisis of representation, where the state must address citizens’ deepest concerns and implement meaningful actions. Additionally, as seen during the pandemic, combating disconnection—both from oneself and from society—emerges as a central challenge that requires a systemic approach.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Our portfolio aims to contribute to the resilience of people and communities, particularly those facing greater vulnerabilities. It presents a non-pessimistic counter-narrative focused on sustainable development and empowering communities for action. Thus, by showcasing successful initiatives, our portfolio’s results and outcomes can act as valuable inputs for nourishing public policies, ultimately aiming to reduce the global sense of insecurity. 

 

The CoLab possesses extensive experience in successfully engaging with local communities and youth. Prioritizing community participation has been a cornerstone of past learning cycles, such as the initiative focused on citizen science and financial inclusion in vulnerable locations. These experiences have yielded valuable lessons into effective strategies for local populations. This knowledge base allows AccLab to integrate innovative approaches and specialized expertise to support the local development of resilience capabilities. 

 

Youth participation has been a continuous thread throughout our various learning cycles. From utilizing young volunteers to map financial inclusion solutions to integrating citizen science projects in schools, youth engagement is woven into the Lab’s experience. We believe this approach strengthens our efforts in addressing sustainable development. Our research methodology is centered on reconstructing life trajectories. This approach aims to identify the social, cultural, personal, historical, and other factors that shape youth attitudes, views, and behaviors towards climate and building resilience. 

 

Complementing the life trajectory methodology, collective intelligence is another added value to this challenge. The Lab leverages its experience in fostering collective intelligence as a tool for consensus building. We have successfully employed this approach with diverse partners, including governments, social organizations and colleagues. Our capacity for experimentation, rapid adaptation, and the development of replicable and scalable models allows for broader and more sustainable impact in the promoting sustainable development.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



In the face of environmental disruptions, understanding the motivations of young activists is a strategic imperative. This understanding should encompass factors that inspire them to take public action, the strategies and practices they prioritize, the meaning they give to their activism. 

 

Building on the importance of understanding youth activism, a critical question emerges: How can we leverage the effectiveness of capacity-building and resilience strategies by meaningfully engaging young people and local communities? Specifically, we seek to address these questions: How can innovative methodologies and traditional practices of local communities be more effectively combined to develop sustainable and culturally relevant resilience solutions? 

 

To efficiently address our challenge, several aspects need to be approached in depth. Firstly, it is essential to identify and understand the local communities’ traditional practices and specific knowledge about the environment and sustainable development This knowledge is vital to developing approaches that are not only technically sound but also accepted and sustained by communities. 

 

In this regard, we have conducted sensemaking workshops to engage with local communities. These workshops facilitate the identification of opportunities for building resilience across various dimensions. Notably, these workshops prioritize the recovery and promotion of traditional local knowledge systems. Looking ahead to 2024, our focus remains on refining methodologies and tools that enhance community participation in climate action.   

In addition, a thorough exploration of how innovative technologies and approaches can be seamlessly integrated with traditional practices is crucial. This involves research and testing of various collaborative and co-creation models with communities. Through this process, we strive to ensure that proposed solutions achieve a true synergy between innovation and the enduring wisdom of local wisdom. 

 

Early experiences within this challenge have underscored a critical lesson: apocalyptic visions of the future can hinder the potential for positive change by promoting feelings of helplessness. Recognizing the power of shared visions, we are now delving into this area. Specifically, we will explore the impact that co-designing and envisioning positive futures possibilities on community engagement and action.  

A second learning question addressed is how local, community and more broadly experiential knowledge can leverage strategies against adverse climate events.  

 

For instance, in the case of the native plants workshop we jointly address the appraisal of native species for their ecosystemic benefits, considering current and future scenarios. Among the many benefits to the ecosystem of the native flora, it favors environmental balance, as it is home to local fauna, including insects, like butterflies, which improve the environment by pollinating, as well as other animals. It also regulates temperature and can prevent the spread of invasive plant species that erode the soil, making it more susceptible to flooding. People living in rural areas, riverside regions, and green environments hold valuable knowledge about these native species. However, this essential knowledge of native plants is often scattered among people, each with distinctive perspectives that could enhance both the individual and collective understandings of the native flora and its significance. In this context, the Nativa Workshop was conceived to build bridges and weave connections, fostering a “cross-fertilization” of knowledge through diverse voices.

This challenge leverages three key methodologies: life trajectories approach, collective intelligence, and futures design. The life trajectories approach guides our interview process and analysis. Through in-depth interviews, we aim to understand the motivations and pathways of young people engaged in public action. These interviews delve into various aspects, including participants' backgrounds, entry points into socioenvironmental activism, perspectives on national and international sustainable development movements, utilized strategies, and connections with other stakeholders. 

 

The interviews are semi-structured and encompass a purposive sample of teenagers and young adults actively engaged in socio-environmental activism. The sample is carefully constructed to ensure diversity across several key dimensions. This includes participants with direct exposure to environmental issues like floods and pollution, alongside those who are from unaffected regions. Furthermore, the sample encompasses both leaders of organizations and individuals involved in other capacities. This multifaceted approach guarantees a rich and diverse cross-section of voices from across age groups and geographic regions within the country. 

 

In addition to this research with a qualitative methodological approach, another study was conducted, using semi-structured interviews as the data collection technique. The purposive sample consisted of 18 people, evenly distributed between women and men, aged between 18 and 46, with an average age of 29 years. Socioeconomically, the sample was designed to include two profiles: one with basic needs met and an average educational level of secondary or higher education, and the other with greater difficulties in maintaining their quality of life, with an average educational level of secondary education, typically of the head of the household. The interviewees were residents of both urban and rural areas, from the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) and various provinces of Argentina. The analysis strategy was based on a flexible and interactive approach, centered on constant comparison. 

 

 

The concept of collective intelligence proved instrumental in identifying and sharing valuable local knowledge about native flora. An engaging exercise empowered participants from diverse groups to collaboratively integrate and translate fragmented knowledge into tangible, achievable short-term actions. This inclusive process involved civil society organizations, kayakers, park rangers, lifeguards, nursery workers, university representatives, and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA). 

 

Collective intelligence exercises hold immense potential in exploring possibilities for desirable and positive futures. The dominance of dystopian narratives in our collective imagination can impede progress toward a better world. The inability to even imagine, optimistic scenarios make the task of directing ourselves toward reaching these goals more difficult. Recognizing the value of foresight exercises, we broaden the inquiry: who are the “designers of tomorrow”? This encompasses writers, video game designers, activists, environmental scientists and a wide range of stakeholders.  

 

Our goal is to convene this diverse community to envision a shared positive future collaboratively. Through co-designing an inclusive and optimistic future, we aim to explore its potential impact on perception, attitudes, and behavior. 

 

We will further explore the potential of positive deviance tools to analyze large datasets in search of effective resilience strategies. This could involve launching a “Visualization Data Contest” with a specific challenge: identifying individuals or groups within a community who have achieved better outcomes despite facing similar challenges. Analyzing these positive deviants can illuminate innovative approaches and best practices that can inform, for example, future energy strategies or mental health interventions, ultimately fostering greater community resilience and adaptability. 

 

Finally, we are embarking on a preliminary investigation into the potential applications of the fungal kingdom in areas such as mycomaterials, mycorestoration, food security, and health. This exploration aligns with our overall goal of enhancing resilience and sustainability. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



While a substantial body of research exists on the factors influencing socioenvironmental activist behavior, including emotions (insecurity, responsibility, guilt, uncertainty), the desire for collective action, social media engagement, and prior experiences with political activism, there remains room for further exploration–. Our Lab is dedicated to advancing the understanding of collective action aimed at influencing public policy. We will achieve this by identifying effective solutions and collaborating with public partners to promote their implementation. Through our research, we strive to enrich the conversation on socioenvironmental action by exploring critical questions: How can we foster greater collective action? What key factors influence youth engagement in public spaces? What best practices and strategies can optimize the effectiveness of socioenvironmental action? 

  

A collaborative effort with local communities as part of our climate action initiative has revealed critical data gaps. Most notably, a lack of detailed and systematic information exists regarding traditional environmental knowledge and adaptation practices within these communities. This limitation hinders our ability to understand the historical interactions between communities and their environment fully. The systematic collection and analysis of such data is crucial for developing culturally relevant and effective strategies. This approach ensures respectful integration of local practices, fostering a more comprehensive and sustainable response to socioenvironmental challenges.  

   

Furthermore, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding attitudes, perceptions, and levels of local community involvement in current sustainable development initiatives. This data is essential for developing effective engagement strategies. By understanding these dynamics, we can ensure that interventions are culturally appropriate and achieve long-term sustainability through sustained community ownership and application. With this crucial knowledge, climate action initiatives can take advantage of opportunities to cultivate local commitment, a critical factor for success. 

   

Finally, a critical knowledge gap persists regarding the most effective methods for integrating traditional knowledge and best practices with modern technologies and approaches. To address this gap, we propose collecting data on successful experiences and challenges encountered during such integration efforts. By analyzing this data, we can glean valuable insights to inform the facilitation of synergy in future initiatives. This novel data is crucial for addressing our core learning questions and fostering the development of culturally relevant and technically sound approaches. Ultimately, this approach will contribute to enhance effectiveness and long-term sustainability of our  initiatives undertaken by the Argentina Accelerator Lab.

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Resilience is a cornerstone among the Signatures Solutions championed by UNDP on a global scale. In this context, the contributions of the AccLab hold significant promise. The Lab’s focus on gathering alternative forms of evidence based on the lived experiences of individuals and groups within diverse territories aligns perfectly with this global initiative. Furthermore, the Lab’s emphasis on community action, solidarity networks, and the vital role of local knowledge in building resilience demonstrates a strong synergy with UNDP’s call to action. By prioritizing these areas, the Lab positions itself to play a key role in addressing the growing insecurities and uncertainties faced by people around the world. 

 

By bolstering the growth of knowledge and capabilities for resilience, our core objective is to contribute to a process that facilitates the development of solutions specifically tailored to the needs of communities vulnerable to socioenvironmental shocks and other disruptions. Additionally, we strive to strengthen the role these communities play as advocates for adopting sustainable practices within their own contexts. 

 

In addition, our collaboration with the Binational Project, equipped with a defined action plan and dedicated resources, presents a strategic opportunity to scale up the solutions identified through our various activities. The participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups working on sustainable strategies and community development will be critical in this endeavor. Many of these groups have already taken part in workshops we have hosted, demonstrating a strong foundation for collaboration. These partner organizations possess invaluable local knowledge and expertise. Their engagement will not only provide valuable insights but also bolster the implementation of projects and facilitate the dissemination of results and lessons learned. This collaborative approach ensures that our initiatives remain closely aligned with the specific needs and realities of local communities.
