> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Makeshift liquid measuring cups made from used plastic bottles. The innovation is characterized by holes of varying sizes - the bigger the hole, the lesser amount of cooking oil is left. In this case, the innovation measures up to 1kg, 0.5kg, and 250ml of cooking oil. This eases the way the reseller repackages the product depending on the demand of the costumer.
