Post HIV status Trauma Managemenent (PHSTM)

> Brief description of the innovation

The Phenomenal Youth Association (PYA) is a youth-led organization consisting of both HIV positive and negative people that are fully engaged in the eradication of HIV/AIDS and reduction of new infections by 2030.  With the Prevention Access Campaign, a health equity initiative with the goal of ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic as well as HIV related stigma, we launched the Undetectable = Untransmittable (U=U) initiative were the Association made its first record as a Youth-Led organization, of implementing the initiative to the communities, social media, radio stations and other media platforms. 
The main objective of this concept is to involve Adolescent and Young Zambians both rural and urban in combating HIV/ADIS and its related effects.   
We intend to do this through PYA’s unique mission and partnerships with organizations that will make income the fighting of GBV, STI’s and SRPH a realistic dream, as we have positive young role models who openly share their HIV status to fight stigma and other stereotypes and vices surrounding HIV, these will be mentors and role models for other young people living in denial to come out in the open or find someone to confined in, who is of the same age group. Furthermore, this platform and strategy from PYA will help each young people to thrive and to be resilient in times of adversity, as we intend to have a secluded place away from the normal clinic, which most young people shun, to access our services.  
With this project we help HIV positive young people to find hope and love, through empowerment ventures, skills and support systems. The mental health bit is critical to achieving this goal.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In the end we intend to have Zambian young people living with HIV to have a complete secured, confidential, favourable, and professionally friendly environment run and managed by trained young who are themselves HIV positive and have gone public, ready to help their peers.

> Technical Feasibility

The project is the development of an online app, calling and texting platform that provides anonymous private and confidential SRH services. We believe that HIV among young people will be under control, so our able team of project implementers will be working 24/7 in ensuring messages and calls are responded to, just as our social media team will keep engaging users on different trends, happenings and new data about both covid-19 and HIV/AIDS, by using popular activists and icons as spear headers or role models for the project. 
Our works are further justified by the engagement of all beneficiaries in our daily works, which makes it easier to manage resources and monitor the project’s progress or success. This is done different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, WeChat and many others, these have been instrumental in our quest to get more young people open up or involved in our works.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The awareness and sensitization campaigns will not only help policy makers and the government, but will give deeper insights on other variables not even mentioned that will be uncovered during interactions with the youths, adolescents, and women about their health and community engagements, this will definitely improve the work of HIV/AIDS activists, by supporting long term relations between NGO’s, HIV advocates, government and other key stakeholders, especially young people and find a way forward in formulating workable, and practical support systems and policies that are young people centered, without disadvantaging government efforts. 
Secondly, we hope to raise the level of young people’s participation and social accountability by all Zambians beyond the HIV/AIDS, thus, the targeted groups and beneficiaries will be involved beyond the Chilimba Project in our awareness and informative radio, TV and online programs, especially our local communities, women, youth, and ethnic minorities who have been overlooked for a very long time.
The success and positive results of the project will ensure that its sustainability is sustained and expanded after the completion of the grant. This will be achieved by: designing and implementing programs related to the grant, also by improving on the existing strategies and activities, even by engaging other grassroot stakeholders to lead in long term initiatives that will make these activities last long with meaningful impact. Such initiatives include; local based community engagements, civic education, practical works and income generating programs to sustain and tolerate and grow such works at grass root level.
