> Brief description of the innovation

Powering Young Initiatives (PYI)  is a Legally registered Non-Profit Making Youth Organization domiciled in Southern Province of Zambia. 
It is a Livingstone based organization whose primary objective is to empower a diverse group of young people with leadership and entrepreneurial skills to be used to address environmental issues, primarily climate change, as well as contributing to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in Zambia. In order to achieve the objectives PYI organizes multiple programs and activities  which  includes Climate Change Public Advocacy, Conservation Youth Farming and Beat Plastic Pollution. In the quest to enable the organization to be self financial sustainable PYI has decided to embark on Reducing Waste Generation Project which is an Eco-Inclusive Enterprise Development  project who's objective is to support and train 1,000 unemployed youths to develop eco-friendly small business enterprises that will both improve their communities economically and benefit the environment.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Powering Young Initiatives is changing the way young people and their families live their lives amid a rapidly changing climate. We believe solutions to climate change will be accelerated by the collective and positive actions of individuals and communities. Our initiatives are for the disadvantaged in Zambia – particularly the young and unemployed and women who are often among the more vulnerable in society. One of our key programmes is to support and train 1,000 unemployed youths to develop eco-friendly small business enterprises that will both improve their communities economically and benefit the environment too.  The challenge Prize  will help us to change the lives of 1,000 unemployed young people, and their families? Just imagine the impact your Challenge prize will have.
