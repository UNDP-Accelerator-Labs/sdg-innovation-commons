> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

When the company buys agricultural products from peasant farmers, medium farmers and commercial farmers, then transport them to DRC CONGO for sell.  Peasant farmers, medium and commercial farmers shall be given cash immediately.  Bank of Zambia will benefit from the sell of US Dollars from DRC CONGO.  

The Zambian transporters shall be paid money for transporting the agricultural products to DRC CONGO.  The manufacturers of bags for packaging of the agricultural products shall be benefices immediately.  The loaders of the agricultural products shall be daily employees being paid on weekly or daily basis. 

The selling price in US Dollars in DRC CONGO, once exchanged on Bank of Zambia will benefit the Zambian government in earning the foreign exchange badly needed by the country.

> Technical Feasibility

The marketing company will need adequate capital to purchase trucks, build warehouses for storing agricultural products, pay peasants, medium farmers and commercial farmers for the agricultural products throughout the country.  This will mean most young men/women will be employed as office workers, truck drivers, loaders, clerks, accountants, managers, etc.  When the business is fully grown then it will require concentrate slumps to established in agricultural districts where products shall be bought and stored in tents before transporting them to DRC CONGO.  The prototype was in the UNIP government where they had used the cooperative marketing arrangement.

The proposed implementation plan is to purchase all agricultural products, especially from the rural areas throughout the country, where the Food Reserve does not reach in the purchase of the strategic food reserve for the country.  Hence, there will be need to have food storage facilities in each provincial headquarters as well as a number of trucks to haulage the products from the farmers to DRC CONGO for the sell of products.  The Chililambobwe Zambia-Congo borders as well as Solwezi-Congo borders as selling points for the products purchased throughout the country.  All the neighboring countries can also benefit from this marketing of agricultural products.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Zambia has neighbors, southern African countries, east African countries and west African countries as well as northern African countries that are in need of the agricultural products that Zambia has failed to supply to them and earn foreign exchange in return.  

Firstly, when the peasant farmers, medium farmers and commercial farmers know that the Zambian government has found them markets where their agricultural products can be sold at a high demand and high price, then the farmers will need to extend their pieces of land to produce more products.  

Secondly, the rural areas shall be provide employment to the youth.  Once, the government maintains high prices for the agricultural products then it will provide money to the farmers.  It will change the life-hood of the farmers and provide high quality of their healthy.  The youth will require to stay in the rural areas because of high income from their agricultural products.

Thirdly, the national income from these agricultural products through taxes will contribute to the national budget to benefit in terms of better schools, hospitals, and roads.   This will raise the standard of living for the Zambian community.
