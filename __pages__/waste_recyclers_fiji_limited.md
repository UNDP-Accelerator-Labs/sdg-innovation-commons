Waste Recyclers Fiji Limited (WRFL) is the leading private company in Fiji that provides a wide range of recycling and waste management solutions to a range of business houses, hotels and resorts—they have been in operation for over 25 years.  

Over the years, WRFL have built a special relationship with informal waste pickers, who are an essential part of their supply chain. Informal waste pickers ensure recyclables from dumpsites are recovered and delivered to WRFL.  

Through WRFL recycling incentives, an iTaukei (indigenous Fijian) woman was able to turn waste picking into a sustainable livelihood for herself and her family, where she was able to finance her children and grandchildren’s education abroad.
