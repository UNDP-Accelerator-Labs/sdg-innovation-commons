> Solution name

Visibility and dignity of women recyclers

> Description

REDCicla is an initiative aimed at raising the visibility and dignity of women recyclers. It begins with the identification and mapping of women who recycle in the streets, disseminating their information so that neighbors, businesses, offices, institutions, ventures, companies, and government agencies can directly deliver their waste to them. Additionally, capacity-building for recyclers is conducted, along with the use of a mobile application, Redciclapp, that allows users to connect with them
