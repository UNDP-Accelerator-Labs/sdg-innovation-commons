> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

This project consisted of the development and manufacture of an electronic device that allows energy from solar panels to be adapted for subsequent injection into the conventional electrical network. The electrical voltage provided by a solar panel has the characteristic of being direct current, so to be injected into the conventional network it must be subjected to a process that converts it into alternating current. The solution is designed for residential users who want to venture into clean energy, reduce electricity costs, and take care of the environment.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The solution is modular, which implies that it could be complemented with the use of other renewable energies (hydraulic PicoTurbines, windmills, etc.) if necessary. As an advantage, the device allows to reduce the electrical consumption of the conventional network of residential users through the production of energy through photovoltaic panels. The components are inexpensive, and the challenge is achieving identical functionality. The estimated cost is between 500 and 600 US dollars, that is, half of what is paid today in the market for a device with similar features.
