> Title of the innovation

To promote Moringa growing and eating project.  It is sustainable approach to combating poverty, malnutrition and environmental degradation deforestation and lack of employment. This dense nutrient rich Moringa tree also known as miracle tree can be grown by local women and others to provide Social enterprises opportunities for cooperatives and nutrition for their families. The sale of Moringa leaves fosters economic development and generates an income for the communities.

> Brief description of the innovation

An investment in growing and eating Moringa products leaves. Pods, fruit will improve the health of individuals and the sale of these products will alleviate the poverty as generation of an income will be enhanced. 
There is scientific evidence which shows that the Moringa leaf contains 10 types vitamins- A, B1, B2 B3, B6, B7, C, D, E and K. and all essential minerals Protein, (18 types amino acids, including 9 essential amino acids), 92 nutrients, 46 anti-oxidants, 36 anti- inflammatory compounds, 
This makes Moringa as one of the best nutritional food supplement which is necessary for the human body’s health especially with regular consumption.
This answers the sustainable development goal on health, agriculture, poverty, 
Moringa tree is fast growing and drought resistant, add nitrogen into the soil, anti-bacteria and used for water purification, a source of cooking oil, bio-fuel and animal feed. With all these applications Moringa has multiple solutions to man`s problems.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The investment in promoting awareness will help improve sales of the products. This will improve revenue base of our company., for expansion and create more jobs. Currently the sales are bad because moringa is associated as medicine and not food. It is critical to run awareness campaign nation wide.
 Given the array of the nutritional content of the leaf as shown above, I intend to take the challenge to advocate for popularization into the diet of the Zambian community throughout the country. I am an aware that people generally are more easily persuaded to accept a commodity which has medicinal and immediate effect, they may not easily be persuaded to go for an item that is for preventive in nature. It is for this reason that a multi-pronged approach will need to be taken to change their mind set. I am therefore requesting for support for my effort for investing in awareness in Moringa and its nutritional benefits to improve health in Zambia population,
I believe the request fits under your giving area of Health, Agriculture, Climate Change program. 
The challenge prize will help the business grow because it shall help foster thr the awareness campaign.
 The expectation is that when people receive the knowledge and information on Moringa as a good source of vitamins, minerals, protein (including 9 essential amino acids), anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds and essential fats for proper body health, people will be encouraged to grow and eat Moringa. Moringa is a fast growing tree, drought resistant and also grows even in poor soils. All parts of the tree are useful either as medicine or vegetable food leaves, flowers, seeds for oil and cake for water purification. 
The more we have growers the better as more processors will emerge  and grow the grow the market of moringa products. In short job creation will be achieved.
To the environment by the growing of moringa we are addressing issues of deforestation. we are addressing the soil fertility and moringa leaves absorbs more carbon dioxide the any other tree species, .

> Technical Feasibility

Implementation plan
Training and sensitization workshops across all provinces
Sensitization programs through  both electronic and print media
ACTION PLAN
Bearing the above observations out lined the following activities will be undertaken. 
Television appearances 
This will involve buying air time space on various revision channels for discussion and presentation purposes in the three year period.

This segment will require follow-ups to ensure the trainees adhere to the growing standards. It will also attract processors, and retailers in the long term.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Investment in the Moringa promotion will result in immediate and self-sustaining impact on decreasing the many forms of malnutrition including Immune boosting that the COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted. Others issues the Moringa will generate income and employment in the country and also address poverty environmental degradation and climate change mitigation. In addition to the above indirectly healthier bodies lead to high physical productivity. Well-nourished children are generally intelligent in school and are more productive and better learners and successful adults. Well-nourished population spend less on health care saving resources for investment and growth
