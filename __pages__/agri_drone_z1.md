> Title of the innovation

Agri-Drone Z1

> Brief description of the innovation

This is an electric mega-drone that is capable of lifting the weight of 200KG. It is intended to help farmers spray their farms, move heavy things through air, and  there's no need to recharge as it has the provision for self-charging. The drone is capable of carrying 100L of liquid throughout the day can be used to spray the farms. To control this drone, the drone will have the radio receiver, without the need of internet.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We hoping to generate income through the sale of the drones to farmers that will need to buy and we can also be able to hire them out for farmers, and anyone in need of its services. 
Most farmers in Zambia fail to buy or hire Helicopters for spraying large farms especially if they are pests in the farms thus the drone can be of help and reduce costs for these farmers. It will also improve the way inspections are made on the field of farmers, we are hoping to add a thermal camara which can enable farmers to get data on the field and the plants. We hoping that this can bring about  precision farming in Zambia which is an approach where inputs are utilised in precise amounts to get increased average yields, compared to traditional cultivation techniques. They can scout thousands acres in a single day by flying a drone.
As noted our target market are the farmers, that is both commercial and small farmers. This drone can further be used in surveillance, wildlife management and transportation of goods to hard to reach places. 
The challenge prize will help us to develop more drones and just being part of this program can expose to more opportunities.
Our drone will be using solar power, and thus can reduce on the use of electricity.

> Technical Feasibility

This mega-drone has four propellers to add stability we will make it a puller drone for it to be above the ground without shaking and be able to rotate at the same position. The person controlling it will use a controller with 8 control channels connected to the drone via radio waves connection. Radio wave connection which will be used, is 2.4 MHz (Short-range) by which the drone will remain connected within few kilometers away from the controller and 72 MHz (Long-range) which the drone will be connected to the controller within more than 100 miles away from the controller.
The software has already been designed and will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the use of  supervised Machine Learning.
We do not have a prototype yet for this drone, but if we have all the necessary material and resources  we can make the drone in one month.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We are hoping to include more young people in building drones as it will allow them to develop skills in robotics, software and hardware design. Other areas where drones make an impact are in policing, fire-fighting and helping the displaced population in search and rescue operations.
