## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Initially, our challenge was rooted in the lack of awareness among indigenous people about the climate crisis in Bolivia. This lack of awareness was attributed to their immediate economic growth and health needs, which were considered factors contributing to ecosystem degradation not easily noticeable in the short term. To address this, we proposed the creation of indogenous life system plans tailored to their needs to prevent logging (as a mean to obytain economic resources) and other ecosystem damage.

As our journey unfolded, we realized that awareness was just one aspect of the issue. During our workshops to formulate indigenous life plans we included a crucial phase aimed at raising awareness. To achieve this, we utilized videos, posed unconventional questions, presented evidence, and employed future visualization techniques. While this approach assisted in shaping a desired vision of their future that took the climate crisis into account, it proved insufficient to change their mindset, which tended to prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and regeneration. This perspective became evident during the solutions crowdsourcing phase, where short-term priorities were once again emphasized. Thus, we recognized that addressing the climate crisis requires not only the acquisition of knowledge but also a transformative shift in mindset.  So, during various workshops, we strengthened the long-term sustainable approach that finally emerged, albeit to a small extent, in the last workshops. However, it is necessary to involve more stakeholders from the ecosystem in the long-term sustainable approach to create a critical mass for transformations, with a special focus on linking governmental with indigenous planning.

2. People with indigenous and scientific approaches sometimes cross paths, but they usually don't talk. Sharing indigenous and scientific knowledge to create indigenous life plans was tough because there wasn't specific scientific information available. To solve this, we invited local technicians from NGOs working in indigenous territories to share information and experiences during workshops with indigenous people. The technicians had a clear role – to provide information without taking part in discussions. That was quiet important because deliberation was supported by evidence to effectively address problems and solutions. People from NGOs and many indigenous individuals met each other, but they lacked opportunities and spaces to share their information. Later, we discovered that there was a university offering a program in environmental health near indigenous communities. Surprisingly, indigenous people had never thought about sharing or asking for information from the university. sometimes perspective distances are tough to see when phisical distances are insignificant.

3. Closing gaps involves understanding the gaps system.

Our team found that understanding development gaps involves recognizing other underlying gaps, such as cultural  gaps. During our journey, we identified some unexpected gaps, like communication ones. Even though we and indigenous people speak the same language, we don't necessarily share the same understanding, and we may not even use the same words. For example, some Spanish words, like "livelihoods," may be unfamiliar to certain indigenous people. Conversely, there are words in Guarani (their language) that lack significance in Spanish. The term "environment" is used by indigenous peoples, but it seems not to fully represent their comprehensive understanding and connection with nature. Due to our interpretation of the same concept may differ, this disparity could influence the comprehension of both problems and solutions with negative effects on impact.

Regarding commonly used tools, such as a Likert scale, indigenous people seem to grasp the tool better when the questions are concise, accompanied by an explanatory drawing, and the scale is a range of numbers (preferably 1 to 10). Perhaps the latter part is influenced by their circular comprehension of reality.

To address these gaps, prototyping with humility and empathy plays a crucial role in understanding these underlying gaps and proposing empowering solutions.

4.Diversity can lead to powerful conversations when it can be felt, seen, and experienced. Technology and data can help facilitate this.

Diversity is crucial for addressing complexity, but differences can create imbalances when not well managed. In our workshops, indigenous community authorities presented various perspectives, each vying to be seen as having the correct viewpoint. However, when we utilized a form with basic questions and visualized the results in simple graphs, they became aware of other opinions. The focus shifted from seeking to be heard to attempting to hear and understand others.

5. Empowering communities also involves transforming relationships with stakeholders. Our CI method also included a local component focused on strengthening and transforming relationships with stakeholders. Thus, their life plan, a result of applying the chosen CI method, could become an effective tool for managing their development. It was crucial don't forget the main objective in applying the CI method

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Our work is being systematized as a methodology guide to build life system plans to be delivered to the government (Plurinational Authority of the Mother Earth) as part of the insights for the development of planning tools for the 36 indigenous peoples. On the other hand, the insights from the journey will feed into the new GEF program in our Country Office.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Ancestral knowledge addressed the missing collective intelligence from the past and Collective imagination enabled collective intelligence for the future.

For the present information, a participatory and collective approach helped to respect their current governance dynamics and  surveys enabled the opportunity for every opinion to be captured.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective inteligence helped to addres the diversity gap in national planning linking indignous with municipal planning with the goverment and civil society stakeholders. Data visualization was crucial for indigenous peoples to feel their point of views diversity adn that helped to stablish conditions for co-creation, identifying

Kaami is an indigenous territory comprised of 19 indigenous communities in the Chaco region of Bolivia that sought to develop its life plan. Unfortunately, our initial partner, CIRABO, couldn't be a part of this journey due to some misunderstandings that prevented their participation until September in this year.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The systematic application of the collective intelligence methodology, (centered on our value proposition, testing, learning, and proposing) was crucial for understanding gaps and designing a potent tool to address them. Without this approach, we might have encountered challenges during implementation and missed out on valuable insights.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
