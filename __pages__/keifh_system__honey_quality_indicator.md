The Kelulut Essential Indicator of Fresh honey (KEIFh) is a system for evaluation of fresh kelulut (stingless) bee honey. This system is equipped for detecting synthetic honey to ensure the supply of high quality kelulut honey. The product package is portable and comes with a manual, analysis report, beekeeping information guide, and the KEIFh station. 
The KEIFh Scale is a copyrighted chart that maps out the parameters detailing the physicochemical components in the honey. There are a total of 8 parameters: 
1. water content
2. pollen
3. aroma
4. acidity
5. colour
6. HMF
7. enzyme
8. rheological behaviour.

These parameters combine to identify natural kelulut honey.
