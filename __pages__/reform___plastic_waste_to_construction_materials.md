Instead of contributing to plastic pollution, Evergreen Lab, a local social impact business, has started Reform a project to use low grade plastic waste to upcycle into building materials and furniture. They take low grade plastic (e.g: single-use plastic bags, wraps, styrofoam etc.), process it into plastic flakes and mix it with some other ingredients (aluminium,glass powder…) through heat press to create strong composite materials for construction materials (tiles) or furniture (tables, lockers…).


Single-use/low grade plastic pollution is a huge problem in Da Nang as there isn’t much of a market for it with traditional recycling industry. This solution could help to showcase a circular economy model for low-grade plastic.
