Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Today is November 29, 'armed' with ski jacket and curiosity I went out from home on cold streets of Bishkek. It is unusually cold for November in Bishkek - minus 5 degree. The day before strong snowfall colored everything in white. 
In my neighborhood municipal administration arranged temporary market place and allowed local farmers and small producers to sell their products for citizens of the city during weekends. Walking by rows of trading places, I was thinking if I can find something which is worth the grassroot innovation name. It was a last row and I said myself "Where I should go next to find the innovations?", and immediately I faced with farmer selling his vegetables in interesting boxes. Bingo! I greeted him "Salam aleykum!" and he answered "Waleykum assalam!". 
After traditional greetings I asked his permission to interview him and make some photos. Bakhadyr baike (brother in Kyrgyz language) told his story. His name is Bakhadyr and he lives in Sretenka village in 45 kilometers from Bishkek city. Twenty years ago Bakhadyr with his wife decided to immigrate from the South of Kyrgyzstan to neighborhood of Bishkek for 'better live'. Now they have a daughter and a son. His family has a small land (plant is 50 ares) where they grow potatoes, bell pepper, pumpkin and other vegetables. 
Bakhadyr told that last three weeks were very cold in Bishkek (up to minus 12 degrees!), so it was hard to keep vegetables (especially, perishable ones) in good condition. Many traders in the streets challenged with high risk to lose their goods and save the only source of income. Bakhadyr was thinking how to sustain his 'green' worth. One day he decided to construct 'thermos' for keeping temperature warmer than outside. He drawn a design of box, took 2 insulation lists (left after repair works) and scotch tape. After several manipulations two new and promising boxes were ready to use.

Testing was very successful, and it is amazing that fresh bell pumpkins stay 'tradable'. In order to increase temperature in thermo-box, from time to time Bakhadyr lights a candle inside.
By the way, Bakhadyr said that he has another grassroot innovations in his household, and I hope that I will have a chance to discover new innovations and share new stories how ordinary people solve daily challenges.
