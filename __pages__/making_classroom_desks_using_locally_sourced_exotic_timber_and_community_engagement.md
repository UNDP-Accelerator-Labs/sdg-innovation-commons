> Brief description of the innovation

These two seater desks are produced at new Mzumwa Primary school by the Parents Teachers Association and the parents. After seeing how learners were subjected to sitting on floor during lessons, it ignited absenteeism to many school going learners. Therefore it was agreed at an extraordinary meeting that the school embark on making desks using community based labour. But the challenge was on resources to hire a powersaw to cut timber.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The commercial viability of the innovation will improve learners attendance at school and hence improve performance. Provided every pupil sits on a desk in class, learners wont be subjected to hardships of sitting on the floor which affects their concentration in class. Girl child is the most vulnerable because of their biological nature when sitted in discomfort. This will help buddy young entrepreneurs with a school background.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to help schools come up with solutions within their reach materials. It is to be implemented by engaging a powersaw operator to cut exotic trees planted in the school yard some years and fortify simpler and durable desks than waiting from the central government.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve small scale families who will be engaged to do the carpentry and erect the desks. The proposed innovation will help the schools in the district to be self reliance.
