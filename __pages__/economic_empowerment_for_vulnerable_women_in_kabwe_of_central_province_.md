> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This project is aimed at providing a Stable supply of fish which is one of the main sources of protein widely consumed by Zambians. This means that demand for this product is mainly stable all year round and since fishes grow rapidly, there will always be enough to supply. Investing in fish farming will definitely incur large and stable stream of profits over time hence why we want to run and invest in the fish Farming at farm land.
We also have a land for Gardening, Keeping Pigs and Layering Chickens. We are targeting households in Kabwe and this challenge Prize will help us make this dream come true to empower the Women of Kabwe especially in Makululu Compound. It has no effect on the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

This project aims at Empowering the Vulnerable Women in Makululu Compound of Kabwe as a way of providing the beneficiaries with capital to put up Fish Ponds, buy fingerlings, Feed and run the Gardens, Piggery and Chicken Layering in order to improve their Livelihoods. So we will need to dig the Fish Ponds at our land and stock them with fish which will be run by the 50 Women from Makululu Compound in Kabwe.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The target areas are affected by high poverty levels more over 80% according to statistics from Central Statistics Office, Zambia (CSO report of 2010.)       
The target area is the community that was largely dependent on gainful employment from the mines that have since closed. These communities are affected by the evolvement of the economic and environmental conditions in Zambia; the unfavorable conditions that have affected incomes at household levels.
The project will directly Empower Women with income to sustain their homes and improve their livelihood through the running of the Fish Ponds at our land owned by the organization by ensuring the Fish Ponds are done and stocked with Fingerlings ( Tilapia) , Entrepreneurship Skills , Financial Literacy , Provide Education support to enroll and keep the Girls in School and cushion the impact of HIV/AIDS and remove the Women and Girls from indulging in illicit activities such Prostitution, Failing pregnant at tender age and being forced into early marriages. This intervention will complement the government’s call that has been promoted national wide. The direct benefit will trickle down to the community as Women will benefit directly in the day to day managing of the Girls and homes.
