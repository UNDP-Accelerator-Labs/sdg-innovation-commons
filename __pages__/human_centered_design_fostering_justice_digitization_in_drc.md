## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) design the tool purely based on the operating procedure is planning to fail as it does not reflect the specific operational reality of the clerks, judges, and prosecutors' functions   2) Without CSM senior management involvement in the Conception-tests-evaluation process, the level of resistance could have jeopardized the co-creation process : (1) Empowerment of the clerks, Judges, and prosecutors in the design with our ICT design officer on back-to-back mode has fostered the appropriation of the tools (2) the feedback loops established in the experiment sat the flexibility to update necessary changes in the software by the developer   3)It is more efficient to tie such a digital transformation experiment with a ready-funded project whose objectives are aligned to accommodate the purchase of computers and other necessary equipment for the tests   4) perception survey done on users demonstrated high satisfaction in terms of overall UX  because (1) it created the first magistrates' database and prison population database (2) clerks praised the tools for their impact on fraud    5) Reporting from weeks to instant reports generation (stats and issue mapping included), the tools improved productivity and decision-making in the entire penal chain

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

the only bottleneck encountered was the slowness of administrative decision-making at the CSM level and the ministry of justice required to accompany the experiment and loW level of computer literacy within focal points

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

-focus groups were used to capture the most precise reality of each function at the levels of courts, offices, prisons and CSM -L'observation participative a permis de gagner en contrôle de qualité en capitalisant sur les connaissances et l'apport de tous les professionnels de la justice lors des évaluations sur l'applicabilité des outils aux différentes fonctions. -A survey was used to assess the value creation and effectiveness of tools by users to guide the developer's UX and UI improvement process Note: this is the very first attempt at digitalization by co-creation experienced by the superior council of the judiciary, the data gap, therefore, is huge. By doing so, we are building the 1st digital database and data source for decision-making in the justice sector

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Addressing the human dimension of the challenges required a high degree of participation of justice professionals from the design process to the experimentation to circumvent the resistance of a profession with very little computerized.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

CSM and Ministry of justice: Assigned focal points and signed administrative orders to the body of Professionals to cooperate and contribute to the process 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

None, we have leveraged the long-existing partnership from the justice reform project team to speed up the process

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

JNone, we have leveraged the long-existing partnership from the justice reform project team (Pillar Governance) as our prime internal partner providing additional funding and technical assistance to complete the experiments as well as historic knowledge from the previous partnerships with CMS and the Ministry of Justice. This has been helpful to maneuver in each phase  of the experiment
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The key for us was to ensure that the process was driven by the actors (clerks, bailiffs, judges and prosecutors) of the profession while training them on the merits of participatory methods. The enhancement of their expertise in all phases has made it possible to avoid the obvious barriers due to the low digitization of judicial operations and services in the DRC.

Through  this experiment we have applied for Anti-Corruption for Peaceful and Inclusive Societies (ACPIS) initiative and got secured a 370K$ funding for a mid-scale up of the initiative "BOYE NDE MALAMU" tied to the anti corruption project at governance team. We have pitched the learnings from the experience and sold the lab value to link them to the fight against corruption in justice sector,
