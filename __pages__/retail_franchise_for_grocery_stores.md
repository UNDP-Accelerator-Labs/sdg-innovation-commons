> Brief description of the innovation

There are thousands of grocery stores across Zambia that provide both jobs and a source of livelihood to millions of people. However, many of the grocery shops face closure due to increased competition from large multi-national supermarkets and e-commerce companies. 

We are building a retail franchise for grocery stores with a focus on providing grocery owners with innovative tools such as branding, marketing, buying power, Point of Sale (POS) technology, e-commerce marketplace and credit facilities to help grow their business and increase sales while giving consumers a new shopping experience that offers affordable products and savings.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Unlike existing retail franchises that charge exorbitant fees to join, we are building a franchise model that will generate income through sales commissions from suppliers, advertisement and delivery fees. Our model will enable us to partner with manufacturers and other large distribution companies that usually do not sell to small retailers. Our target market is mom and pop shops located in high density areas. Studies show that 20% of SMEs die in their first year and 50% die by the fifth year. Interestingly, studies equally show that less than 5% of franchises fail every year. The success rate of SMEs that run as franchises is remarkably high compared to those operating as solo enterprises. The challenge prize will help us setup a Distribution and Training center for continuous support to franchisees and employees as we push towards our goal of recruiting 1,000 retailers by 2026.

> Technical Feasibility

Our retail franchise business will provide our franchisee with branding, Point of Sale (POS) mobile application, sales promotions and advertising, buying power, credit facilities and business training. Using the POS, franchisee will be able to order stock from suppliers and have it delivered to their store the following day. Furthermore, our franchisee will be able to buy products on credit (facilities that usually available to large supermarkets only) and enjoy stock transfer on slow moving products to avoid expiring. Currently, we have developed a POS Android mobile application, e-commerce Android app and a training portal for our franchisee.
Our implementation plan in the first year is to focus on recruiting 100 retail partners within Lusaka. The next five years, our goal is to have over 1,000 retail partners in Zambia and once that is achieved we can set our eyes on international expansion.  To achieve our goals, we have a founding team made up of sales professionals, executives with experience working in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. This business model is based on lessons learnt while working with various businesses in Zambia and realized that the problems of SMEs go beyond the lack of funding.

> Anticipated Social Impact

One of Zambia’s main economic challenges is an ever growing informal sector. Millions of people fall under this category where they are self employed, or work for those who are self employed. In most cases, people are not on payrolls and thus are not taxed. Many informal workers do their businesses in unprotected and unsecured places. We established that the problems of lack of capacity, poor work ethics, inadequate structures and processes, and lack of transparency are as detrimental to the success of SMEs as poor infrastructure and access to finance.
Why does franchising succeed? Franchising has been described as a template for business success – a way to quickly, identically, inexpensively and efficiently replicate business success. It assists SMEs by providing advantages such as structure and processes; discipline in operation; training and capacity building; a pre-sold customer base and access to market, access to technology, market development and advertising and access to funding as a result of improved bankability. Studies across the world show that the economies with vibrant SMEs have used franchising as their engine of growth. Our business model will tackle the problem of failure of SMEs and by extension, the scourge of poverty in Zambia.
