FightCancer

> Brief description of the innovation

Cancer_Aid is an application aimed at improving the quality of first aid offered to cancer patients. Our objectives for developing this App are to address issues such as emotional first aid, Anxiety management , depression and suicide management, physical first aid such bleeding and bruising , Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) aid for cancer patients etc..
The App will also provide a social network for cancer patients where they can interact to help them know that they are alone..
We also aim to provide interactive learning material filled with quizzes and puzzles to help teach patients on their conditions and shed light on the do's and don'ts to help them prevent infections ..
The App will also provide free consultancy thus patients or their care takers can ask questions to oncologist any time they like.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will offer premiums of K10/month for the App.Ofcourse other features of the App such first aid lessons will accessed freely but features will only be accessed upon payment of the premium . 
Our target is to partner with the ministry of health so that the government in their aim to offer free medicare can pay the premiums for patients, this would mean that all the features without them paying however if this plan fails, we will offer the premiums directly to individuals.. We will also advertise(controlled adverts) for pharmacy, hospitals and other medicare businesses.
We strongly believe that this App will help in providing quality first aid and medicare to cancer patients and will help minimize emotional break downs, suicides and depression caused by cancer.

> Technical Feasibility

Their is no prototype at the moment

> Anticipated Social Impact

Cancer not only affects the physical but also mental well-being of affected individuals thus providing a social platform for patients is very important.
As we know, some of the challenges faced by cancer patients include
1. Difficult decision making
2. Difficulty recogning infections
3. lack of proper knowledge in how to prevent infections
4. Poor quality of first aid if any.
This App is aimed at addressing all of this challenges thus making the world a better place
