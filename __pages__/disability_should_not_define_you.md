Disability should not define you

> Brief description of the innovation

In this innovation I could mainly support people with disability... disability is not inability. 
Most disabled people are often looked down upon as if they aren't capable of doing any better work.
  If we could empower them in learning skills eg teaching the music and how to read and play instrument will can produce a big orchestra...they can be empowered by learning this skill.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If we empower disabled people we are empowering the 21% of the population these people have families and their children depend on them.
By creating employment for them we are helping them support the children and family.
 For example starting an orchestra for them other people would be hiring them eg at gatherings and other funtions 
And also they can be having concerts to raise funds which will be sustaining them.

First of all they first need to learn the skill and this can be done by having a proper infrastructure ... purchasing of instrument and other learning materials
