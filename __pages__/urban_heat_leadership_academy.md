Urban Heat Leadership Academy is a programme run by the Nature Conservancy and the Phoenix Revitilization Corporation and a local non-profit. The Academy is a five-month program that meets roughly twice a month and teaches Phoenix residents about how to address the urban heat island effect. It also connects them with academics researching solutions andlocal government officials responsible for managing the problem. The goal of the Urban Heat Leadership Academy is that residents learn how to hold the city accountable, advocate for themselves, and implement their own solutions.
