> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation is an alternative method of generating electricity for an off-grid home.
It is a low cost innovation that uses a motorcycle alternator to generate electricity from wind  or water hence the name HYDRO WIND GENERATOR. The innovation is made from junk motorcycles parts and scrap yards. The generator uses  a Suzuki DR200  magneto and three phase 18 pole stator coil to generate 230 Watts. Voltage is a steady 13.5- 14v through the motorcycle regulator with enough revolution per minute (RPM). 
After using it with a water wheel I can say that it does work, and  puts out about 220 watts. It was tested using automotive light bulbs. It should charge a battery fine. Seems very efficient and it does work.
Consumers may use this innovation in place of a solar panel. This innovation has an advantage to work without a battery except I would recommend a battery to have a stable voltage.  The goal was to build something cheap that could be maintained easily using only parts available in Chavuma. The generator can be fashioned to work with wind or a water wheel.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The demand for solar electrical appliances  for homes, farms and other businesses has gone up in Zambia ever since power blackouts started. Today Urban shops and market stores sell a wide range of solar powered appliances, including radios, power-supply banks, cell phones, cell-phone chargers and lights.  
My innovation is an alternative method of generating electricity for an off-grid home.
I will generate income by way of making and selling the Hydro-Wind Generators to locals, through repair works, and teaching people how to make this innovation on their own. 

This innovation will promote other businesses such as motorcycle dealer shops, hardware shops, phone stores and other shops that sell electrical appliances. I am also optimistic that this innovation will inspire young adults to create something to improve our communities.
It is impossible to start up this business without funding. The prize will help me to register a business name and get raw materials that I will use for this innovation to be successful.

> Technical Feasibility

My Hydro-Wind generator is constructed on a  200mm by 300mm solid metal plate. Four 15cm bolts are screwed to the metal plate in a pair of 2 and a bearing is fixed between each pair. The bearings support a long shaft that lay across the metal plate. One end of the shaft is  splined to a sprocket or turbine and the other end is fixed to the magneto. The magneto houses a stationary stator coil . Rotating the turbine or sprocket spins the magneto over the stator coil. This movement creates a magnetic field that induces a voltage in the winding of the three phase stator coil. The three output wires of the stator coil  go to a regulator rectifier which in turn charge the battery or light a bulb.

I have seen a prototype of a car alternator which outputs more power than that of motorcycle alternator, but aren’t permanent magnet so have lower efficiency, and very hard to spin if you self excite it and need high rpm.

I will finance the project for the first one year after which I expect the business to grow, otherwise, I will have to auction all assets and shut it down.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation is portable and can be used anywhere. People will have access to information through the radio, TV, and social media. Furthermore, with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic where learning institutions are switching to online learning, many students will have access to education in rural communities. 
My alternator hydro wind generator is expected to fuel demand for electrical appliances such as radios, inverters, cell phones, Television sets, 12 volts bulbs, and motorcycle parts. In turn, it is expected to promote other business such as motorcycle stores, electrical hardwares, phone stores and many more. My hydro-Wind Generator is likely to bring competition to solar energy market size which in turn is excepted to bring a reduction to in price of solar energy panels which are very expensive at the moment. 
My innovation draws free energy from the environment and does not produce green house gas emissions. Today, increasing environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions followed by increasing energy consumption are driving industries towards more efficient and cost-effective energy supplies. Such factors has pushed the development of the solar energy market size where my Alternator Hyrdro-Wind Generator falls in this category.
