## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The objective of the experimentation was to test what impact will build upon the strengths, and bridge the skill gap of student-led initiatives around career development, have on increase student engagement while providing incentive mechanism and digital platforms to increase awareness

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

- If we promote student led entrepreneurship and employability skills development platforms then students capacity will be enhanced.  -  If the platforms will be student led, then students engagement and active participation will improve. • - If we develop incentive mechanism for students, then subscription to the platform will increase.  - If we use social media and messenger apps for communication then dissemination of information will be better compared to other ordinary promotion tools like posters and fliers

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Acc Lab tests a scalable model for a desirable and easily accessible student led platform to enhance university students and graduates entrepreneurship and employability skills. Our key audiences for this experiment are university students enrolled at AASTU and we will use existing student led platform Cassiopia as an entry point. Acc Lab makes tweaks to existing process in partnership with EDC, Dereja and AASTU. EDC will bring years of experience in entrepreneurship to the platform while Dereja will bring its experience inbuilding employability skills of university students. Goh lab will collect and analyze real time data from this experiment. And finally, the lab will consolidate learnings and come up with recommendations to scale up student led platforms in other universities in Ethiopia. Acc Lab launched the experiment and Cassiopia ran the experiment in AASTU for a month. Acc lab monitored the platform, collected and analyzed real time data on subscription, participation and measure satisfaction of members. The lab used telegram poll, monkey survey and google forms as a tool

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

- Number of university students subscribed to the platform. - Level of satisfaction of platform members - Equal participation of male and female university students

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The lab used telegram poll, monkey survey and google forms as a tool

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

120 hours of Acc Lab team. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Throughout the experiment, we observed students move away from passively receiving information to actively participating in their learning experience. This then became beneficial in engaging more students in the activities because they learned that they are not just receiving instruction, but actively shaping their futures themselves. Therefore, universities should take advantage of making their career development activities demand-driven and practice student-centred or student-led approaches be more engaging.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

No significant change

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

 Service fee for EDC • Service fee for Dereja. • Hall rent and refreshment

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

To take our finding further, we are exploring the possibility of joining forces with initiatives at the Job Creation Commission that are looking to empower the education sector to produce qualified graduates with skills and ethics that fits into the labour market

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

During our experimentation, we found that there are more than 20 student-led platforms and clubs in the campus working on different topics including tech, entrepreneurship, charity, environment piece etc. About 58% of students are participating in extracurricular activities inside and outside the campus, but these platforms and clubs are neither working together horizontally nor working closely with career development centres on common agendas like employability and entrepreneurship skills.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Having formal agreements with partners was a challenge for private sector and  even for academia. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP projects working on skill development and jobs

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government, Other UN agencies (we have tried to sell our experiment to UNICEF via our joint Generation Unlimited Initiative. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Not much

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Start it small then expand it 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, for areas related to skills development and jobs 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The prior exploration activities highly dictate the experimentation design and plan. 

> What surprised you?

University offer on skill development and employability are not tailored to their student needs and highly lack desirability and ownership.
