## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Surfacing Sustainable Blue Economy Innovations 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the Blue Economy is an underdeveloped sector in South Africa and innovations in this sector are not yet identified, mapped or analysed. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The world is increasingly acknowledging the importance of oceans and freshwater systems in maintaining ecological balance, combating climate change, providing livelihoods, and as an unchartered area for innovation application. The Blue Economy is focused on protecting and restoring the ocean resource base and marine health, as well as opening areas for new sustainable economic activity.

South Africa has 3900 km of coastline, the ocean economy contributes only 2% to our GDP. Government has begun implementation of an Oceans Economy initiative with a focus on: Marine transport and manufacturing activities; Offshore oil and gas exploration; Aquaculture; Marine protection services and ocean governance; Small harbours; and Marine and coastal tourism. However, implementation has been slow, and there are gaps regarding a focus on environmental sustainability and coastal communities. There is additionally relatively little known about grassroots innovators or small enterprises in the blue economy in the country.

Though SA has an established action plan for unlocking the ocean’s economy, there is growing concern that this will result in an exclusion of small-scale fisheries and other community members. There is additional concern over the focus on mineral and gas extraction, and prioritising economic growth over environmental sustainability. An intervention focused at supporting grassroots innovators and entrepreneurs will surface lessons on how to tackle this, as well as facilitating access to direct capacity and financial support.

Growing trends include the increasing interest in macroalgae as a solution to climate change; the expanding research focus on the potential for ocean-based foods to transform our food systems; the importance of localising food systems for enhanced community resilience; the ocean as an ecosystem at the forefront of responding to climate change etc.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Building on the lessons learned through our food waste cycle, we have found that through using portfolio approaches with a focus on green/blue innovation support, we can achieve impact across multiple SDGs. We can apply the same design methodology to this cycle, as well as tackle a thematic area which has never been tackled within the CO portfolio. The AccLab is also setting up parallel work streams in this thematic area, for example working with WWF on an OIC proposal and the Japan Innovation Network on seaweed cultivation. We additionally have developed a relationship with a private sector partner who have demonstrated capacity to raise significant impact investment funds to scale innovations.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What sustainable blue economy innovations currently exist and how can they be supported and scaled to benefit coastal communities and ocean health?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Innovation Challenge - surfacing existing innovations 
Sense making - understanding how innovations can be replicated in communities 
Experimentation - supporting proof of concept for innovators 
System thinking - building ecosystem of actors and identifying opportunities for sector development 
Horizon scanning - research to identify developing trends in the blue economy 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Little is known regarding innovations and small enterprises in the blue economy, particularly in coastal communities. This will be addressed through the use of a national innovation challenge, research, and ecosystem engagement. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We have identified key partnerships above, and will be working with the private sector to identify impact investment opportunities for the innovators, government to inform their existing initiatives, academia to access relevant research, and NGOs to provide local support and build a community of practice. Through developing a partnership with AUDA we hope some of these solutions will be replicated in other African countries.
