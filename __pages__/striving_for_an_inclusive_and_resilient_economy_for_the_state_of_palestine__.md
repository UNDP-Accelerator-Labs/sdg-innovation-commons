## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Striving for an inclusive and resilient economy for the State of Palestine through creating a pathway for social enterprises
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Palestine has a fragile and non-sovereign economy that is dependent on financial international aid and on Israel’s economy, and despite numerous efforts to revive economic activity by different stakeholders, little growth has been measured over the last few decades. The legal structure for Social Enterprises (SE) is new to Palestine and creating a pathway for social enterprises without a legal framework creates additional burdens on entrepreneurs. While early SE successes are uncovering new pathways towards sustainable economic development, the gaps and barriers in the regulatory environment are becoming more evident.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Palestine’s economy is built on dependencies driven by Israel’s political and economic will. This relationship has eroded Palestinian self-determination, access to free markets, and prosperity. Other than the complex political context, the intra-Palestinian divide has weakened the economy as it hinders striving for a common vision toward a better economic future. Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, many attempts were undertaken to create a financially independent state, but the result is an increased dependence on foreign aid, which has reinforced traditional economic models that continue to fail. The effect is higher unemployment rates, higher poverty rates, greater dependence on external economies, and an erosion of trust between Palestinians and the government/their institutions.

Over 50 years of Israeli occupation has had a lasting and severe effect on Palestinians and their institutions, putting into question the viability of a contiguous Palestinian State. The looming annexation of large swaths of the West Bank and the unclear future of the Palestinian State have led to the erosion of trust between Palestinians and the Government in the absence of a clear economic and political vision. Palestine already has high levels of poverty and unemployment, which have been exacerbated by the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic. The World Bank forecasts a decline in national GDP between 2.6%-7.6%. The poverty rate is projected to stall around 27.5% in 2021. Unemployment in 2020 according to Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics stood at 25.9% at the end of 2020 (15.7% in the West Bank and 46.6% in Gaza).  General comments on why now:   1. Political landscape (for 50 years Palestinians felt that someone was “caring for us”). This past year, everything has shifted- such as Israel normalizing ties with some Arab countries. This has brought a sense of despair & anxiety (and increased isolation). 2. Growing skepticism about “development” (creating urgency for an approach built around “genuine engagement”). Skepticism: development is self-serving, it is not working in the real interest of the people, it is importing foreign logics & interests, it is not effective. 3. Where the conventional role of government is weak, a potentially vulnerable gap grows.  Currently there is an emerging SE community, but with no shared definition for Social Enterprise in Palestine.  Through UNDP/PAPP’s deep demonstrations work, two opportunities have emerged for Palestine: 1. Ground for proof of concept because of the lower cost of operations and human resources, so Palestine could become a testing ground for start-ups in their early phases, which could attract investments. 2. Remote working and outsourcing (translation services, teaching Arabic, etc)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is working under the Innovation Facility and through a Deep Demonstrations to understand the problem space of Palestinian economic activity. The Accelerator Lab is part of a larger core team working through a systems transformation lens to identify opportunities to contribute to an inclusive and resilient economy that rests on a different economic concept from the traditional linear & extractive growth economy. The reason that the Accelerator Lab is well positioned to work on this challenge is that the team has been using the Accelerator Lab methodology to infuse exploration, solutions mapping and experimentation of solutions before embedding them into programming. The Accelerator Lab has the space away from programmatic delivery to focus on the big picture to work toward a new economic vision. It is worth investing resources to this challenge given the urgency of the matter and the current ever-shifting political context with the Palestinian elections coming up and the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Social Enterprises hold the promise of providing an entrepreneurial model for delivering on great social need that could help augment the Palestinian government’s capacity to provide for the public good and generate economic growth

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How do social enterprises currently operate? Would it make sense to start with a certain sector to revive social enterprises or to focus on the enabling environment more broadly?  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We would start by assessing the current situation for social enterprises and understand what could be done through engaging with users themselves to realize if it would be beneficial to tackle one specific sector or work on the enabling environment for social enterprises more broadly

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Currently, there is no data on social enterprises in terms of which challenges they tackle, how they have been operating given the lack of a legal framework, and what could be done in the interim while a legal framework is institutionalized. 
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How could we collaborate with universities to support students in translating research ideas into start-ups and social enterprises? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Learn directly from university students and engage them in the work on social enterprises

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no information directly coming from students on their interest in working on social issues and turning ideas into a social enterprise or start-up. Most ideas for start-ups fail as the market needs are not well researched and the notion of generating social capital is removed from the entrepreneurial mindset. 
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Would launching an ‘Impact Hub’ for social enterprises in Palestine generate more employment opportunities for youth as an immediate step (while working in parallel on a longer-term goal of having a legal framework)?  Which global models can we learn from? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Learn from other experiences and tailor it to the Palestinian experience, and explore whether having a hub would make sense given the different existing co-working spaces and techno parks in Palestine. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data gaps exist in how other global experiences could be applied to Palestine, both in terms of launching an 'Impact Hub' for social enterprises and for working on a legal framework for social enterprises. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The ones who might benefit the most are social entrepreneurs who are trying to start a social enterprise but keep running into major challenges given the lack of entrepreneurial ecosystem and the lack of a supportive enabling environment. Stimulating economic growth through social enterprises could greatly benefit the youth of Palestine (university students).
