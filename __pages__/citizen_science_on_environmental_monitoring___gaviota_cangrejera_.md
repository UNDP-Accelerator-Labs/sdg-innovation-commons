Overall goals: Contribute to the conservation and management of Olrog’s Gulls (Larus atlanticus) considering their habitats and their behavioral flexibility in the event of any potential changes in the conditions of the area they inhabit. The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to the implementation of ecosystem policies in the management of the marine and coastal environment. Specific goals: • Determine the migration movements of Olrog’s Gull specimens using citizens’ reports on ringed birds. • Study habitat selection by this species during the non-breeding season in areas exposed to different anthropic impacts and link such information with the data collected on their individual condition and behavioral patterns.

Description of citizen participation: During field research, Olrog’s Gull specimens are caught for ringing.  As part of the monitoring process, individuals are ringed, molting characteristics are recorded, and samples of blood and feces are taken. Additionally, behavioral tests are conducted to determine their personality traits and flexibility. The information gathered may be compared with the reports on ringed birds found in different coastal areas in the south of the continent.  Citizens record ringed birds and report the number on their ring by sending a photo and the location of the bird (georeferencing).
