UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab joined hands with 'PathFinder’ - a unique, virtual cross-cultural educational platform that aims to educate K-12 level students, including disadvantaged schools - to develop a multi-country program to introduce entrepreneurship education to high-school students. The idea was to empower these students, unleash their creativity, encourage a mindset of abundance and self-determination, and promote purposeful entrepreneurial action.  The Accelerator Lab in collaboration with Pathfinder organized a bootcamp in which 24 students participated, of which fourteen were from Bangladesh, six from Zambia, four from India, one from Sweden, and nine from the Philippines. There were three workshops designed for the participants, focusing on SDG - 4 ‘Quality Education’, SDG-5, ‘Gender Equality’, and SDG-17 ‘Partnership for Goals’. The workshops were on SDG learning, Problem Framing, and Human-Centric Design Thinking which was conducted by subject matter specialists. These workshops enhanced the participants’ knowledge about digging into a problem and finding practical solutions. During the problem-solving sessions students identified some of the biggest challenges in their home countries and other participating nations in the Bootcamp. The students devised solutions to their identified problems and presented their solution ideas to the judges and the winning team was provided a mini grant from Peace First to implement their idea.  This bootcamp sparked passion among the participating high school students and inspired them to put their ideas into action. The Bootcamp was an international collaboration made possible due to strong support from a diverse group of institutions including The Resolution Project, Peace First, Impact Hub Dhaka, OC365, and Unleash Plus. In early 2022, PathFinder is launching its three-month-long cohort with UNDP Accelerator Lab Bangladesh and partner organizations. Through these cohorts, 250+ students will be engaged to become SDG solution change-makers to make our community more inclusive and sustainable.
