> Title of the innovation

Virtual Laboratory Environments (VLEs)

> Brief description of the innovation

Many learning institutions in Zambia especially secondary schools face challenges in accessing science laboratories either due to lack of infrastructure or unaffordable materials and apparatus. Virtual Laboratory Environments (VLEs) are a substitute for physical apparatus and materials used in laboratory exercises in Learning institutions. VLEs are computer simulated environments with an interactive process-oriented user interface that produces a user experience that mimics the experience of conducting a physical experiment. This solution increases accessibility to laboratory exercises to any learning Institution with an ICT infrastructure and subsequently reduces the expense of purchasing materials for experiments and maintaining or replacing damaged or outdated laboratory equipment.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The primary target for VLEs are secondary schools in Zambia. The VLE software packages will be provided for free to customers, however they will be required to pay for each VLE lab session. A session is a single type of experiment performed by multiple users each on a separate device. A single VLE session for 40 users will be prices at an average of $16 (ZMK 360) per session. With an average of 906 learners per school, Zambia has over 1005 secondary schools, approximately 400 of which have ICT facilities. A school is expected to spend at least $1087.2 annually in VLE sessions. Assuming revenue of $126,150 and operating costs of $96,000 annually, the profit margin is estimated at 24% annually.
VLEs are still in their idea stage with no working prototype, the challenge prize will be dedicated to the research and development of VLEs. 
VLEs are expected to reduce pollution that results from disposal of byproducts from experiments.

> Technical Feasibility

VLEs will be designed to take user actions as input and process them using machine learning algorithms 
to generate experiment data. The data for development of machine learning algorithms will be generated, collected and organized by conducting a suitable number of physical experiments. Different artificial neutral network architectures will trained using the experimental data with the best performing architecture used in VLE software.

> Anticipated Social Impact

VLEs are expected to improve the quality of education by providing practical exercises to both physical and e-Learning modes of education.
