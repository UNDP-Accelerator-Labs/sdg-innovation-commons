'Acceso denegado' was a project that provided Internet access to Cuban citizens, since the Cuban telecommunications company only offers the service to foreigners, denying it to residents. Payment for the service was based on a barter system: in exchange for internet access, people offered the artist information on how foreigners can come to understand the Cuban system. From this project, strategies and perceptions about Cuba were developed, the same ones that are shown in the documentation phases of the piece.


Goals
Offer internet access to Cuban citizens who would like to use it. Change the power relations established by the Cuban State regarding the use of free information through the internet.
