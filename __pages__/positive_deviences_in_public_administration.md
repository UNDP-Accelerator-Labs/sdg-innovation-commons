## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Positive Deviances in Public Administration
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Improve access to public services by improving the performance and public dedication of street-level bureaucrats in key state agencies. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Civil service reform is among the highest priorities for improved governance in Paraguay and, at the same time, of the most polemical and polarizing issues for any government that administrates the state. Most reform advice focuses on analysis of poor performance of the public sector, deducing reform content based on accounting of the "poor incentives" within the public bureaucracy. There is a dearth of advice based on analysis of good governance in developing countries and on evidence about how incentives for quality on good performance are constructed within state agencies. A qualitative research approach, focused on positive deviance in the performance of street-level bureaucrats in state agencies that provide key public services can do a lot to open up new reform paths.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

There are a number of cross-national surveys about bureaucratic quality, and administrative data about civil servants and their performance evaluations. In general, however, these data are too aggregated to understand the causes of good performance and positive institutional change, because they arise in very specific conditions in a limited number of settings in countries that are in general characterized by weak institutions.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab's main contribution to this challenge is a powerful and new conceptual framework and methodological approach for developing reform proposals based on the study of positive deviance. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How can we improve the quality of public services and citizen's to them? By learning from committed and successful public-sector workers themselves. By studying "positive deviance" in public-sector performance, AccLabPy is identifying new reform paths based on local evidence.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the social, bureaucratic, and professional conditions that generate public commitment among street-level bureaucrats and trust between front-line public sector workers and their citizen-clients?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

It corrects a bias in the study of public sector performance and the resulting reform advice given by international development organizations.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data generates evidence about what is working to generate commitment and positive performance in the public sector, even under the political and institutional conditions considered inimical to good governance.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The UNDP could incorporate this method into its corporate offers to host governments. Civil society organizations could adopt these methodologies in order to generate innovative and empirically informed reform proposals. Academia could adopt these methods to generate more empirically validated studies of the civil service.
