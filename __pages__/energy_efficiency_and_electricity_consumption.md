## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Understanding the way we consume energy specifically electricity through the bill can help consumers better control it. - Visualizing data plays an important role in cognition.  - Validated the assumptions behind the learning question. - The project was not thoroughly explored before moving to testing. It was not endorsed by the partner nor the environment pillar within the UNDP.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. As we moved towards the ending of the experiments, we reached out to the partner that was very interested in collaborating with the lab on the scaling. When it got to technicalities, it turned out that it cannot be done. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There were no available data on how people perceive and interact with the current electricity design bill. Also, this data gave us an understanding of the needs people need in a new design, and what they look for in it.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The hackathons, HCD, co-creation, data visualization and prototyping were methods that helped create an innovative design for the new bill. These led us to understand behavioral insights which eventually led to better tackle the challenge, 
## Partners
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By capitalizing on behavioral insights, we validated the assumption that if people understood how they consume energy, this would reflect on the consumption levels and lower it.
