## Solution holder: Batoul Al-Rashdan

Circulamic by B.O.R is a clever way to add a partition between spaces that also helps with acoustics. The design is customizable and modular, adding both texture and color to a space while also helping to disguise what’s behind it.

I further developed this and used recycled material from the lab, I also included machines and digital fabrication tools like a heat press to better stick the joints I designed on Rhino + grasshopper and I found out that this structure/piece is useful in many applications as you see here in the pictures, this can be wearables like a skirt, top or part of the Shirts to add more design and coverage to certain clothes you already have at the same time this can be adjusted to wall curtain/partition. Optimizing the flexibility of both Applications as well as transparency options.
