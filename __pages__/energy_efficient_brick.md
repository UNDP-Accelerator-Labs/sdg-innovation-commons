> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The purpose of the project is to reduce the heat flow from the walls of the buildings and ensure energy efficiency. Furthermore, using our bricks reduces transportation costs (The proposed bricks are lightweight) and simplifies wall construction. For the production of our bricks we use waste obtained from secondary raw materials of plastic. Thermal conductivity of our brick  is 5-7 times lower when compared to conventional one.  Our bricks have a potential to completely replace conventional bricks used today, which will significantly reduce the amount of energy required to heat and cool residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Furthermore, plastic waste will be removed from the environment, and a market for a locally produced and highly efficient energy-efficient building material will be established.
