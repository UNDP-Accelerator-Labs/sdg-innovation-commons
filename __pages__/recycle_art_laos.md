Recycle Art Laos is a micro business founded by two siblings in 2014. They tested how to turn office paper to become fine art works. Now they have many types of products which proved to be durable and easy to transport. They have a small home-based factory and hires a few staff. However, they work with the fine art students and provide them with jobs and fair pay. Their primary target group is foreign tourists. Due to Covid19, they have severely affected and now they want to develop new products which target more domestic consumers. They are registered as the national "One District One Product".
