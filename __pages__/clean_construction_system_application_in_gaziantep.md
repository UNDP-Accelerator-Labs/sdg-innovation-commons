Clean Construction System Application in Gaziantep
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The issues of transparency and overall accountability of the public institutions in reconstruction processes in the post-earthquake environment are often overlooked on 6th of February 2023, when Türkiye was hit by a M7.8 and a M7.5 earthquakes. As such access to accurate and timely information on developments such as building and road maintenance and reconstruction of critical services, demolition of unsecure buildings, is particularly relevant and critical. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Municipalities play a crucial role in involving citizens and overseeing construction projects, especially after disasters. However, challenges like bureaucratic inefficiency, ineffective mobile apps, and lack of transparency often hinder access to accurate information, leading to shortcomings in citizen engagement and oversight. Transparency is often understood by the local authorities' one-time information disclosure processes that lack the reach and accuracy in fully understanding the entirety of processes thereby hindering participation, engagement and oversight.   

Considering the difficulties that Turkiye is facing after the devastating earthquakes, being quite relevant with the context, Acclab wanted to localize what Korea has done after they witnessed disaster affecting their construction sector.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) has made continuous efforts to find an effective way to prevent the practice of shoddy construction work in the industry. Ultimately, the SMG came up with the Anti-Corruption Clean Construction System (CCS) that sought to infuse the country's advanced IT industry innovations into the construction process, which discloses information to fulfill citizens right to know, improves the efficiency of the construction business in an innovative manner, and manages transparency at construction sites.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to the Türkiye Earthquakes Recovery and Reconstruction Assessments (TERRA), which was jointly developed by UNDP, World Bank and EU in cooperation with and support to the Government of Türkiye the most prominent component of the burden imposed by the earthquake on the Turkish economy is the damage in housing units by 54.9.; second largest damage is the destruction of public infrastructure and damage to public service buildings entailing an important re-construction work for the public infrastructure and service areas and buildings.

Transparency is often understood by the local authorities' one-time information disclosure processes that lack the reach and accuracy in fully understanding the entirety of processes thereby hindering participation, engagement and oversight.   

The Republic of Korea has undergone significant development within a short span of time, transitioning from a war-torn country to one of the world's most developed nations in less than sixty years. However, alongside its remarkable progress, Korea faced challenges in its construction sector, leading to tragic incidents like the collapse of the Seongsu Bridge and Sampoong Department Store in the 1990s. These disasters underscored the importance of a robust maintenance and repair system. In response, the government implemented the Special Act on the Safety Control of Public Structures and established the Korea Infrastructure Safety and Technology Corporation to conduct safety inspections and repairs on aging facilities. 

The Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) has made continuous efforts to find an effective way to prevent the practice of shoddy construction work in the industry.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



AccLab has written a proposal to USPC (UNDP Seoul Policy Center) to localize Clean Construction System to Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality and it has been approved. AccLab built the bridges between innovation, UNDP efforts after earthquake and being an international network that can bring technologies innovations to Turkiye. It is a knowledge sharing between countries and also a very good example of UNDP as an international development actor. The resources that will be used for this action is USPC resources.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Acclab's initiative aims to boost Gaziantep's municipal transparency &amp; accountability in construction by localizing Korean product Clean Construction System.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality will be the beneficiary of this action, this partner has long term relations with UNDP Turkiye, although Seoul Metropolitan Government is an unusual partner to UNDP Turkiye. The Korean  policy tool provided by the project, will be localized and e piloted in Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality. The Municipality has a purview over all the construction including maintenance and demolition of all buildings and areas as well as auditing of these.   

The initial localization may only involve limited number of information categories of the project management system. Although GMM has declared to have digitalized an important percentage of the relevant documentation, needs assessment work will indicate to which level Korean policy may be localized.

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Is the Clean Construction System software applicable to Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



  The construction data will be visualized and shared through municipality's public channels. An important local priority is to be able to receive feedbacks and inputs from the citizens.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The data gap is first we need to know what the citizens want to see in terms of construction their region.  Other datas on construction are the ones municipality already has but this testing will find the best way to share this data with public.

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



UNDP has ongoing and planned partnerships with both individual municipalities around Türkiye and with the Union of Municipalities of Türkiye, Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change. Therefore, perfectly positioned to leverage more funding under a number of programmatic initiatives under the headings of civic engagement, business and human rights, environmental sustainability, disaster risk reduction.  

Therefore it will be easily possible to (1) raise the level information collected and disclosed (i.e. to gradually add new functions, modules to the system) in the Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality; (2) to replicate it with other municipalities, especially those affected by the recent devastating earthquakes (3) to link the system to the existing platforms of relevant national level actors such as Public Procurement Authority, Union of Municipalities of Türkiye and Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change. 

> END OF ACTION LEARNING PLAN: Thank you! The form saves automatically and your submission has been recorded. You may now exit this window.



This initaitive was leveraged additional funding from UNDP Seoul Policy Center and will add a participatory approach to the existing system in 2026.
