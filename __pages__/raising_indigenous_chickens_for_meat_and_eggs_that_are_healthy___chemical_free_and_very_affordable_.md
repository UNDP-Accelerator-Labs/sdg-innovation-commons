> Title of the innovation

Raising indigenous chickens for meat and eggs that are healthy,  chemical free and very affordable for my community

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovative was born during the first wave of the covid 19 pandemic between January to june 2020 when business shut down and means survival were hard to come by. With the little money I had left I bought 30 chics and later on bought an incubator, I paid for online tuitions on how to raise birds and that is how it all began. By November 2020 I started hatching the eggs that the chickens started laying and the business has continue giving me about k2500 per month which is cushioning the household hold needs. 
My plan is to expand the business and be able to employ workers and supply indigenous chickens to different parts of the country, so any form of support will be appreciated .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income for me in that I can sell the chickens for meat, the eggs for consumption, and the chics to other farmers and generate income to take care of my family. 
If the business is expanded into a farm I can employ locals who can go away with a salary the can help their families. 
The country will also benefit in the tax that I will pay according to my earnings if the business gets established. The country will also benefit from chain stores that I will be supplying the chickens to because they will remit taxes on every sales

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in this way; there will be a layers coop where chickens laying fertilized  eggs which are collected daily
There will be a hatchery where incubation and hatching of fertilized eggs will take place. 
There will also be a brooder where the newly hatched chics will be kept for a period of two months
Then there will be spacious children coops with wire fences where older chickens will be kept until market day.
Then there will be a sales point, specifically to manage the marketing and selling of the eggs and chickens

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact is big because each employee will be well paid hence their livelihood will improve, the community will eat good quality meat with less chemicals with less fat in them making them healthier.
