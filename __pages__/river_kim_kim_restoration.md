The U4S Southern Zone Sungai Kim Kim Restoration project is a joint venture of expertise of four universities, led by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), and Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM). It focuses on environmental sustainability and community development around Pasir Gudang, where the river is located. 
Design concept
"Ri-unite": River unites local community. Sungai Kim Kim, located between two industrial areas will act as the new recreation sport for the local community through the interconnected trail and walkway system. Recreational needs such as fitness facilities, jogging trail, bike lane and fishing activity are proposed to encourage people to engage with nature. 
Design:
The project has four main design phases:
Eco Industry: reducing water pollution while greening the industrial zone with nature
Eco Residence: constructing linear park along the river for the residents
Eco Bio: eco-biological park that weaves across numerous pathways will be established along the river
Eco Commercial: commercial area will curve seamlessly along the river and the surrounding natural area
Each design targets different social groups along the river, with the eventual participation of all communities in the project.
