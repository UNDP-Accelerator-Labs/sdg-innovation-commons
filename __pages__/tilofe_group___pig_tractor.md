Innovation Detail: TILOFE is a group of compost developers working to promote locally sourced compost. The group is also working to promote sustainable farming technique that can help farmers in rural areas who do not have access to mechanical tractor to use simple equipment to soften the ground. A simple wooden frame was made to locate pig on spots on the elevated ground used to grow vegetables. Before planting the vegetable seeds, the pig inside the wooden frame will dig the ground and when the ground softened, the wooden frame and the pig can be reallocated to different spot. This continues until all the elevated ground surfaces are softened before putting the seedlings.
