## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Real time, collective intelligence driven supply-chain data mapping
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is want to go where we can engage with private sector, start-ups, farmers, middle men, vendors and customers to explore/ learn how collective price tracking can help us understand why food is significantly expensive at local markets and help customers access cheaper options.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Urban food supply chains in Zimbabwe are highly informal which from an urban hunger perspective creates two challenges. First, the supply chain functions as a black box with no data to drive policy that would make food more accessible and affordable at local markets. Second, it creates localized price manipulation and makes it difficult for households to compare and locate markets with the most affordable food. This of cause has direct implications on chain players up the pyramid like vendors and farmers who could benefit from an efficient supply chain that directs them to demand. The price tracking platform seeks to address these challenges by using technology and incentives to have players report pricing of produce as food moves along the supply chain.

Many articles in the news like the one embedded indicating that the urban population is starving while a lot of food goes to waste due to data gaps in the supply chain

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We are building upon our experience in the informal sector and also this experiment is part of a portfolio designed to work as one. So as acclab we are the first to apply a system approach to solving this challenge. We also have unique partners willing to help us.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Why is  food is significantly expensive at local markets and how can the price be lowered.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

BI: working with viset to understand how nudges and incentives can be used to encourage price reporting CI: relying on a platform where supply chain players can collectively capture pricing DV: Use of a DV platform for citizens to identify locations of affordable food DT: Designing a platform that addresses the needs of as many supply chain players as possible HackerTs: creating prototypes for the platform

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This data will enable a collective intelligence platform to exist and be sustained.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The government will have planning data that is real time and closest to reality.
