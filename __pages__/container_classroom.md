The NGO 'Kolektif Rivier Nwar' works on the West Coast of Mauritius, covering a geographical area from Tamarin to Case Noyale.  This part of the island is one of the poorest, with high numbers of unemployment, drug abuse and children and young adults out of school.  This solution uses a renter container space, which has been converted into a classroom to welcome children and teenagers from the "cité des salines" to engage in educational activities provided by the NGO. The field-worker who manages the on-site facility is a resident of the same "cité" and maintains access (opening, closing, etc.,) to the container.    The solution addresses many problems that the cité faces and has been a success, as many parents like to send their children there.   The activities involve:  (i) learning to read and write (ii) learning to draw and paint  (iii) learning to engage with one and another  An adjacent field is used for sport coaching and classes.  Activities are supported by: 1 specialised educator 1 occupational therapist 1 child psychologist 1 parental coach 1 sport coach 1 music trainer 1 field worker (lives in the cité)
