## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To experiment with moving communities from unsustainable wood-charcoal production to sustainable rice briquette production, the Ghana Accelerator Lab collaborated with Ponna Briquettes (a private company) to develop different types of briquettes made from agricultural waste and conduct group discussions and experiments to test the briquettes from an end-user perspective.  The rationale is that while chemical properties of briquettes (e.g. calorific value) are critical, involving local households in testing generates an understanding of factors that might influence real-life decisions to use briquettes and possibly lessons for scaling up the development, production and use of rice briquettes.     

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a sample of households (represented by local women) are provided with rice briquettes for food preparation, as an alternative to firewood and wood-based charcoal, most households will report better cooking performance with the rice briquettes compared to charcoal.  Cooking performance was measured by a number of specific criteria including heat generated, durability (less likelihood of the briquettes shattering), longevity (briquettes can be used multiple times) and cleanliness (less residue left on the hands).

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

30 local women were recruited through purposive sampling and given 5kg of rice briquettes each to test and compare cooking experiences with briquettes to wood charcoal on a scale of Much Better; Better; Same; Worse and Much Worse. They fed back later in group discussions.  Further experiments then took place, with 10 local women as product testers. Testers placed equal weights of charcoal and briquettes on two local cooking stoves (“coal pots”) and ignited them, to prepare equal quantities of cassava starch in similar saucepans.  Testers also boiled equal quantities of white rice in similar saucepans on similar coal pots, to test cooking time.

About 25% experimentation time.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven.   All the local women rated the briquettes as being at least Better than wood charcoal, for reasons including better heating and cooking time (reaching the desired temperature quickly and cooking thoroughly), generating less ash and longevity (could be used multiple times without replacement), leaving less dust/residue on the hands, and generating little, or no smoke. Some felt that a product of this quality would be more expensive than wood charcoal.      In further experiments with local women as product testers, the testers placed equal weights of charcoal and briquettes on two local cooking stoves (“coal pots”) and ignited them, to prepare equal quantities of cassava starch in similar saucepans. The charcoal generated smoke quickly (within about a minute), while briquettes were virtually smokeless. Smoke makes cooking in small or enclosed spaces, very uncomfortable.  Charcoal also took longer to reach the cooking temperature preferred by the testers. The starch reached desired consistency on the briquettes before the charcoal. By the end of the experiments, a larger proportion of the charcoal had turned to ash, while many briquettes had not. On average, the briquettes kept burning twice as long as the charcoal.     Similarly, the testers boiled equal quantities of white rice in similar saucepans on similar coal pots, to test cooking time. Most said the rice cooked quicker on the briquettes compared to charcoal, by an average of 10 minutes. In all experiments, the women noted there was less dust/residue on their hands from the briquettes. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

In addition to the experiments, involve the local community in marketing and selling the briquettes.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

9 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

5000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We are looking for private sector partners to support scaling.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Involving local women as grassroots experimenters to test briquettes in real-life settings points to high levels of satisfaction among these potential consumers.  Given the abundance of rice husks in the Northern Region and the Government’s Planting for Food and Jobs policy to encourage investment in farming, there are opportunities to develop rice briquettes as a grassroots-led energy solution. In addition to reducing deforestation, this may be a source of income for the youth and women.     There are opportunities to leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement (AfCFTA) to position the Northern Region to export environmentally friendly briquettes.    Ponna Briquettes forecasts a selling price of 1 Ghc per kg, compared to 1.50 Ghc per kg for charcoal. However, increased demand for rice husks could mean they are no longer free at the farm-gate. There are also costs associated with using charring, mixing, and compacting machinery at scale which must be factored in, but this must be seen in the context of potential fuel savings for consumers.     The experiments suggest that briquettes can last up to twice as long as charcoal i.e., for every 2kg of charcoal used, only 1kg briquette is required, reducing monthly expenditure on cooking fuel by at least 50%.   With more partnerships, rice briquettes could be adopted on a large scale, as eco-friendly fuel to help save many trees from being cut for charcoal. Saving more trees means we could deliver more than 40 per cent of total emissions reductions offered by low-cost solutions.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Currently, the main challenge in producing rice briquettes is the compaction process. Compaction at high pressure is critical to avoid producing briquettes that easily shatter, and heat poorly. The innovators have tried both manual and mechanized compaction. In manual compaction, human pressure is applied to moulds, to produce 12 briquettes at a time.   Mechanized compaction creates greater pressure and produces more briquettes. During the experiments, the testers noticed differences in texture and performance between the manual and mechanized compaction briquettes and expressed a clear preference for the mechanized compaction briquettes. While the UNDP funding has enabled the purchase of a mechanized compacting machine, this requires electricity which is often intermittent in the local area.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Environment and Climate Change Cluster in the UNDP Ghana Country Office, because deforestation and the circular economy are within their portfolio.  The UNDP AccLab in Sierra Leone (with whom we have discussed this work, and we are working up a proposal for a collaborative project involving Sierra Leone and Ghana and possibly others.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Other grassroots innovators/entrepreneurs in Ghana and West Africa. Ministry for Energy in Ghana.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. Different mixtures of biomass (rice/corn/groundnut) and different binding agents (cassava/clay etc) in different proportions. We are also looking into non-charred briquettes.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Be open to community involvement.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. Ensure community involvement.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This experiment was part of testing an innovation submitted as part of the UNDP Ghana Accelerator Lab Covid-19 Innovation Challenge. While there were sense and explore phases in understanding the innovation, the primary focus was on testing the idea. However, as the AccLab supports this innovators to scale up, we are also beginning to sense and explore the use of other forms of biomass including corn husks, sawdust and coconut husks. 

> What surprised you?

The enthusiasm of local communities to try alternatives to wood based charcoal.
