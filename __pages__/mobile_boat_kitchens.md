Xochimilco is an area of Mexico City that stands out for still having the traditional canal system original to the Aztec city and it continues to have a largely agricultural vocation, next to the most contemporary turistic attraction. The boat kitchens wander through the canals, pairing to boats with tourists or visit islands to offer food.
