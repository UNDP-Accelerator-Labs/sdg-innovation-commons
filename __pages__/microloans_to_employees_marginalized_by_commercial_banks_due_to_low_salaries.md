MICROLOANS TO EMPLOYEES MARGINALIZED BY COMMERCIAL BANKS DUE TO LOW SALARIES

> Brief description of the innovation

Meflans was set up as a microcredit niche acutely aware of what prevails in the micro credit market especially to the low income strata that face difficulties in accessing commercial banking services. 
The company, therefore, provides specially designed range of micro credit services to Zambians in the private sector that do not have access to the mainstream commercial banking services. We believe that the services are a major component in the micro lending business. Therefore, the company must provide a total solution to customers or employees in the private sector who seem to be marginalized by commercial banking services.
