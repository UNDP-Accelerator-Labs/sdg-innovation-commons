NetXtudo24 – Learning Networks in Elementary Schools


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our Challenge is the poor school performance among elementary school students in Cape Verde, particularly in the subjects of mathematics and portuguese language, especially in rural and peripheral schools where technical resources and access to ICT are limited.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The national educational system comprises the subsystems of Pre-school Education, School Education (Mandatory Basic Education - EBO, Secondary Education - ES and Higher Education) and Extra-School Education (which encompasses literacy activities, basic education for young people and adults). The educational system also includes a technical-professional training component that is linked to the national professional training system.

 

The new architecture of the educational system resulting from the amendment to the 2018 basic law establishes the principle of universality in access to Pre-school Education, targeted to children aged 4-5; a Mandatory Basic Education of 8 years, organized in two cycles, the first being from the 1st to the 4th year, and the second from the 5th to the 8th year; a Secondary Education, with a single cycle (9th to 12th year); and a Higher Education (tertiary/post-secondary).

 

The 2017-2021 Government Education Strategic Plan brought profound reforms to the sector at various levels. According to the Evaluation Report on the Implementation of the Strategic Education Plan (2017-2021) carried out in March 2021, the plan “adopted a set of strategic options and established ambitious/courageous goals for the Pre-school and School subsystems (EBO, ES and Higher Education) with the objective of aligning the educational system with the country's major development challenges.

 

In the EBO, the internal effectiveness indicators (approval, disapproval and abandonment) saw an important improvements in relation to 2016/17, with the abandonment rate currently being residual (1.8%). According to the results of the assessment, the children demonstrated an improvement in performance in portuguese language, but revealed great difficulties in Mathematics, a worrying situation already well identified by the authorities, that translates into a strong degradation in the levels of school dropouts  when entering secondary education and a sharp increase in failure rates at this level, which leads to the belief that learning in basic education is not compatible with the requirements of programs taught in secondary education(Sectoral Analysis published in 2015).

> 

According to provisional data from the Ministry of Education (ME) for the 2019/20 school year, 16,919 children (12%) were enrolled in the Pre-School subsystem; in Mandatory Basic Education (1st to 8th year), 84,018 students (60%); in Secondary Education (9th to 12th year) 31,309 (22%); in Higher Education 8,434 students (6%), making a total of 140,685 students. One of the striking features of the educational system is the existence of a greater female presence at all levels of education, with emphasis on secondary and higher education, with 54% and 60%, respectively. At EBO, there is a stabilization in the number of students due to the demographic effects of the reduction in the fertility rate, with the presence of boys slightly higher than that of girls (index 0.93). The proportion of the State budget allocated to Education corresponds on average to 17% of the General State Budget and 5% of GDP.

 

According to the Evaluation Report on the Implementation of the Strategic Education Plan (2017-2021)carried out in March 2021, only 1 in 3 EBO students responds adequately to questions regarding how the language works. It should be noted that in the mathematics discipline, students still experience enormous difficulties in solving exercises in the areas of numbers and operations and direct proportionality. According to the same report, there is also strong increase in students’ failure rates upon entry into secondary education, 25% at this level versus 7.8% at EBO (which improved from 10.7% in 2016).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



To contribute to the development of the education of children from 6 to 14 years old in rural areas of Cabo Verde by improving the quality of teaching at Elementary Schools in rural and peripheral areas using ICT and by promoting equity in the access to educational information and digital inclusion, enhancing conditions and technological resources in schools and capacity building in the use of ICT, in order to combat regional disparities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we use ICT to create a differentiated educational experience and improve the academic performance of children in elementary education in rural and peripheral areas of the country?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The solution will be tailored with the needs, materials and contents identified by the partner Ministry of Education for the target groups in a collective intelligence process with responsible of the ministry, teachers, and schools. The platform will crowdsource contents from several sources and make it available for certification by responsible. Contents in relevant topics can be subjected to gamification in order to be more attractive to children. A minimum viable version of the system will be developed and tested in a pilot involving 3 elementary schools.



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



• Periodic assessment of the quality of teaching at EBO;

• Socio-economic data of families in rural/periphery areas;

• Data about children with special needs;

• Data about CVs at EBO.

 

This information is relevant to better identify gaps and causes of low school performance and to be able to adjust the solution.


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Possibilities for scaling this initiative include scaling to more schools in other municipalities and cities in the country; include more contents and covering more subjects; scaling to other target audiences, namely special education or secondary education and also the internationalization to other countries, namely in our subregion with adaptation to other languages such as French and English.
