Ai Nono involves carefully constructing rock formations in the sea, within the traditional fishing ground, with the goal of it becoming a location where fish, octopus, clams, sea urchins, and many more sea creatures have a safe breeding space to reproduce and nurture their young. The ‘Ai Nono’ has a special significance in the tradition and culture of the Vanua of Nawerelevu since it is the site where the people catch ‘Dekedeke’, a traditional delicacy which is only caught, prepared, and served during special traditional ceremonies for guests who come to Sinuvaca. The Dekedeke delicacy consists of the different types of fish that are nurtured within these carefully constructed rock formations. Because of the Ai Nonos, the people of Sinuvaca are fortunate to have an abundant supply of fish, for generations, and the fishing grounds of Sinuvaca are always bountiful.
