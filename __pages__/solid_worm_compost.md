This type of compost is a mixture between the organic matter naturally degraded in the composting process and the excreta of the worms (red or Californian coquette) that feed on the available organic waste. Its appearance is very similar to conventional compost, with the difference that vermicompost stores more moisture and is less porous.
Thanks to enzymes within the worms' digestive system, nutrients are easier for plants to absorb.  

It is used to remedy worn soil, to fertilize already established plants, increase the number of microorganisms in the soil, increase oxygenation and protect from heat waves.
