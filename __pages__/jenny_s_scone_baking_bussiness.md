- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I manage to make 2 big buckets a day and I always manage to sell them off ,it's a simple bussiness and if many unemployed youths waiting on government to employ them can try this type of business then it can help them a lot.am single and I manage to buy myself the basic needs which is enough as at now ,instead of begging or indulging in  bad acts to generate income I personally think this is an ideal bussiness.i usually take them close to construction sites and also at the market although some times I target schools.Through this same bussiness I have gained a lot of customers that even follow me upto my house when I don't show up on the road side selling ,I has helped me and also helped many people around.

> Technical Feasibility

I don't really understand this one so I pass

> Anticipated Social Impact

It can help many individuals not just elderly people but even  youths and it doesn't require someone to own a stove but even just using charcoal or firewood you can still make scones..so it can help alleviate poverty levels and also help improve the economy
