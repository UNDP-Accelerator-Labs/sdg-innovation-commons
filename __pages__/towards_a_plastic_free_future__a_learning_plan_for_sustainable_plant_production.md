Towards a Plastic-Free Future: A Learning Plan for Sustainable Plant Production
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The widespread use of plastic bags in plant production contributes significantly to environmental degradation through waste accumulation, soil contamination and microplastic pollution. The challenge is to move away from these single-use plastics to sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives that provide the necessary protection and functionality for plant growth, while ensuring cost effectiveness and long-term agricultural sustainability.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Cape Verde, the excessive use of plastic bags in the plant production sector, whether endemic, forestry or fruit trees, is a major environmental challenge.
Historically, the use of non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags in the plant production sector has been widely promoted in the archipelago due to their easy availability, ease of use, affordable cost and lack of knowledge about sustainable alternatives.
The reliance on the use of these plastic bags in nurseries has contributed to increased pollution and potential degradation of sensitive ecosystems and habitats, such as those found in the country's network of protected areas.
It is therefore proposed to promote the search for sustainable alternatives and innovative solutions that will bring about a radical change of direction with the aim of minimizing and even eliminating the use of single-use plastics in plant production, in line with the national policy on plastics management.

> 

Cape Verde has banned the use of single-use plastics from 31 December 2024. From 18 May 2025, the introduction of single-use plastic products into the national market will also be banned.
The measure was taken to reduce environmental impact and promote more sustainable practices.
Some data on the use of plastics in Cape Verde:
Plastics make up almost a third of the waste in Cape Verde's landfills.
Plastics can take between 100 and 500 years to decompose in nature.
Improper disposal of plastics can pollute oceans, rivers and soil.
Plastic incineration can release toxic gases.
The list of banned plastic materials includes
Non-recyclable or non-biodegradable carrier bags
Disposable tableware
Bottles smaller than half a litre
Polystyrene containers for food and drink
Disposable cutlery and plates
Balloon sticks
