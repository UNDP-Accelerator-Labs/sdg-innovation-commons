## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Co-creation efforts to strengthen urban communities resilience against water-related disasters
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that lack of integration of social and cultural infrastructure within flood mitigation policy requires further testing to assess its value, against existing dominant physical infrastructure-led policies.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Jakarta has two big problems regarding water, namely flooding and sinking of the city. Flooding is always a problem for Jakarta and it always recurring over years that brought about vast socio-economic loss. A study conducted by Lassa1 reveals that there is barely a connection between government policy to flood control and urban development which leads further to unsustainable development of the city.  Historically, Jakarta always suffers from flooding but no concrete action is taken to prevent it from happening in the long term. Instead, watersheds and basins were converted into settlements and luxury malls competed with low-income inhabitants

1. Jakarta is paved with concrete and asphalt which prevents the ground from refilling the water that has already been taken by the inhabitant by pumping it from underground

2. Current programs and policies in place are mainly focused on infrastructure, thus rendered ineffective to deliver systemic change for long-term resilience against future disasters. This due to the fact that social (impacted communities), built (physical infrastructure) and biophysical (water-related disasters) are interrelated and inseparable elements in forming resilience in the context of urban ecology.  Jakarta is also called the world’s fastest sinking city, as fast as 10 cm per year. A researcher said, by 2050, parts of Jakarta could be completely submerged, North Jakarta is the worst.

3 Sinking, along with flooding, puts Jakarta at greater risk of disaster and it could worsen the situation and condition of affected inhabitants, especially the vulnerable groups which are usually unable to evacuate and access adequate social services.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

As an agile entity, the Indonesian Accelerator Lab is strategically positioned between policymakers, UN agency and communities to be able to reduce the proximity to deliver systemic transformation. While there are CO units that are working on reconstruction and resilience and disasters and government stakeholders such as the National Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS) and National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) are prioritizing policy design, infrastructure development and early warning systems to mitigate further disasters, many programs and policies are focused on physical environment and economic recovery. Based on discussions with the Accelerator Lab, CO units and government stakeholders have identified an unmet need of incorporating socio-cultural perspectives to complement and sustain existing innovations. Thus, the Accelerator Lab is bringing its expertise in gaining ethnographic insights from at-risk and affected communities to be integrated into future policy and program design. An agreed concrete step to deliver systemic transformation is the Accelerator Lab’s active role in developing next year’s policy paper on urban flood resilience program with the National Planning Ministry, while involving them closely in the development of a Solutions Mapping platform to provide access to local solutions from affected communities. dialog with policy makers & affected communities integrating contextual knowledge into bottom-up policy design process

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Indonesian Accelerator Lab is testing the newly-established inclusive policy paper on flood mitigation to assess its initial efficacy through different prototyping pathways, such as cross-pollination, policy experimentation, and futures thinking

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

(i) What are the value of inclusive policy implementation, integrating social and cultural capital, in increasing communities' resilience against flooding? (ii) How can inclusive policy design be translated into actionable outcome through co-creation with government, CSOs and affected communities? (iii) How communities can learn from their peers on solving local challenges?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

To gain ethnographic insights from affected communities, methods such as immersion will be carried out to understand common practices and daily habits. Understanding concerns and motivations through behavioral insights would enable the Accelerator Lab to identify what constitutes short-term coping mechanisms and long-term adaptation mechanisms (positive deviance). These positive deviances or best practices will then be the foundation for solutions mapping, which will be transformed into an open tool and platform jointly developed (co-creation) by partners from government, civil society stakeholders and academia. Simultaneously, the socio-cultural perspective from at-risk and affected communities will be utilized to design anticipatory regulation.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

By advocating data innovation (combination of big and thick data) we would be able to identify the data gap in informality and urban landscape change. The majority of available data focuses solely on quantitative elements such as socioeconomic data, population, and census. Thus, by triangulating between existing quantitative data and additional qualitative data (gained through participatory focus groups, conversations, immersion, and interviews), we would be able to tackle the data gap and investigate the habits and the emerging patterns of affected communities. Insights from this process would be synthesized into a concrete recommendation for policy design with the National Planning Ministry. Meanwhile, by zooming out to include historical data and current geospatial, we could potentially develop a simulation of flooding rates in the next few decades to inform current decision making processes.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The National Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS) will potentially use open tools and platforms (solutions mapping) as well as water data stories (data innovation combining big and thick data), which would provide a better understanding of the complexity of the context. Increased visibility of community resilience in the face of urban landscape change, would reduce BAPPENAS’ proximity with impacted communities, and impact on their thinking framework, analysis, and policy design. Showcasing value of cultural and social capital in flood mitigation Increased resilience & knowledge in selected affected communities Eliciting contextual knowledge/case studies for further scale out
