## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Promoting Role of Women in Green Sectors
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is "How can we promote role of women in green sectors?" . 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Despite Egypt’s relatively contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions, those Green economy initiatives do not account for social factors such as income equity, job quality, gender equality, which may maintain or even aggravate the negative social and distributive trends of the traditional economy including existing gender inequalities. Climate changes risks are exacerbating the existing inequalities faced by women and vulnerable communities. Women in Egypt are concentrated in low-productivity jobs with little if any social protection, and career progression opportunities. They tend to work in smallholder farms, run micro- or small businesses and are overrepresented in the informal sector. Recognizing women’s contributions to the survival of the planet and sustainable development is still limited and lacking. Many women have been perceived as more vulnerable than men when encountering and responding to climate disasters, and they are often described as victims in the scenes of climate change. The general perception is that most green work involves sectors like engineering, manufacturing, and construction where women are still significantly underrepresented. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Currently 71% of women are economically active in the informal economy and only 20% of SMEs are women-led (majority being micro-business). In Egypt, women participate in 21.3% of the official labour force. The issues they face vary across economic sectors: 

- In the primary sector, women tend to fall on the lowest end of the agricultural value chain with low paying labour-intensive seasonal jobs. However, many of women’s sustenance contributions and material resourcefulness is not considered as official work in the statistics.

- At least 80% of global green jobs are expected to be in the secondary sector, including construction, manufacturing, and energy production. In Egypt, women tend to study other subjects and enter different careers in education, health, and public administration—hence for largely public-sector employment.

- With the tertiary sector, represents more than 50% of the employed women globally. However, men dominate the better paid service sector jobs like engineering, financial and business services.

Greening the economy has been underlined as part of the government’s focus on the concept of “building forward better” and its contribution to global CC mitigation efforts. In past years, Egypt has made great strides in implementing and investing in strategies and projects that are leading the country to green economies. In 2022 fiscal year the government allocated 30% of the state public investments to green projects (to rise to 50% by 2024). Women very often carry forward the solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation: many innovative solutions such as shift to climate-resilient crops, biogas originate from women.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

In UNDP’s new CPD, “Gender/Women Empowerment” has changed from becoming a single portfolio, into becoming a cross-cutting pillar across all portfolios, being essential to embark on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs, and in the implementation of key national priorities for sustainable development. Our Value proposition is approaching the current lack of green jobs for women as a systemic issue, aiming to find several entry points across either primary, secondary, or tertiary sectors. Women can have an expansive role in all categories of green jobs in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy. Green economy can be an opportunity for women to gain their rightful place in the workforce and as powerful leaders and change-makers in the context of climate change through better-paid, traditional and non-traditional jobs. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Greening the economy has been underlined as part of the government’s focus on the concept of “building forward better”, as well as part of the global climate change mitigation efforts. However, Women are still significantly underrepresented in most green sectors. Climate changes risks are exacerbating the existing inequalities faced by women. Green economy can be an opportunity for women to gain their rightful place in the workforce and as powerful leaders and change-makers in the context of climate change. Moreover, women are often the pioneers in carrying forward innovations & climate change solutions, so empowering them is the key for greening the economy. However, lack of skills of women to participate in the green sectors, as well as cultural barrier have been discussed by literature as major barriers against their participation in green sectors as well as against becoming green behavior adopters. Accordingly, promoting energy and green behavior education at all levels, is a must for promoting role of women in the green sectors. And since it’s a complex topic, and we, UNDP Accelerator Lab, approach complexity with learning, we implemented foresight activities to identify transformative solutions that would make women in green ready for the future uncertainties. We also used foresight to design innovative education activities that would make young females future fit for green sectors and would make female teenagers future green behavior adopters.
