## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To build the capacity of the youth from rural areas by informing, guiding, motivating, mentoring, and providing visibility to partake in entrepreneurship programs and succeed in developing business plans.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If tapping into each phases of youth entrepreneurship journey of rural areas by informing - guiding - motivating - mentoring - providing visibility, then they will partake entrepreneurship programs and succeed in developing business plans 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experiment consists of testing several prototypes that are embedded in the journey of youth applying for a national incubator program. The process of the journey starts with informing the youth from rural areas through SMS messages to apply for the program. The SMS messages will contain a hyperlink to access the application form. The application form will ask the applicants only their contact information and residency. The second process of the journey will be that the applicants will receive a short phone call from the NPSME where they explain the applicants about the program and suggest business ideas based on a study conducted by NPSME on the economic sector of the selected locations. The third process of the journey will be that the applicants will attend a workshop on business plan development that is normally conducted by the NPSME in the closest location. The last process of the journey will be for the applicants to upload their newly developed business plan to an online platform where the applicants have the possibility to showcase and get visibility to potential investors.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

- Informing: send a message to inhabitants of a given town (using the inventory of numbers from telecom companies) inviting them to express interest in business support specifically in areas identified as promising for their town, by filling out a very simple online form where individuals report their name, phone number, and any characteristics to use to as target criteria (e.g., gender, previous participation in business support programmes). This step would be intended to address the barriers related to awareness of business support programmes and lack of knowledge/mismatch about sectors to focus on entrepreneurship. Unit of analysis: No. of applicants vs no. of SMS sent to given town. - Guiding: Compile a list of business sector opportunities that were analyzed from field sector studies conducted from the selected locations, then include them in the SMS/application form. Unit of analysis: No. of SMS/application sent with opportunities vs of SMS/application sent without opportunities. - Motivating: Mobilize NPSME staff/volunteers to call the applicants for 15-minutes to motivate and guide them to partake the business incubator program. Unit of analysis: No. of applicants informed about the programme vs no. of applicants not contacted. - Mentoring: The NPSME will conduct workshops on business development and mentor the participants.  Unit of analysis: No. of applicants attended vs no. of applicants not attended. - Providing visibility: The successful business plans will be uploaded to an online open-source platform to showcase their ideas to potential investors. Unit of analysis: No. of business plans uploaded vs no. of workshop attendees.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

- Guiding: Collect the number of applications sent (online form). - Motivating: Collect the number of people informed about the programme and the ones not informed. - Mentoring: Collect the number of people applied and attended to the programme. - Providing visibility: Collect the number of business plans uploaded to the online platform.
