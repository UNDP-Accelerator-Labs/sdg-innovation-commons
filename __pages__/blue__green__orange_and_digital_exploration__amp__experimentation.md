## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

It is possible to grow rice barley and cray fish on a small Islands which can help to solve food scarcity problems.

The Blue Economy has significant potential which can transform SIDs. While tourism and a source of food is normally the focus it can be used for Therapy, mental relaxation and rehabilitation.

One of the main barriers to sustainable agriculture in the Caribbean is the culture of crop theft also known as predial larceny. Persons refuse to grow their own food for fear of theft and this has resulted in most food being imported. To address food security the policing of crop theft needs to be addressed.

Youth with cognitive disabilities in some Caribbean islands are being put aside by society after they leave school. They are not given the opportunity to contribute to society.

Current innovations such as the BIO Rock project in Grenada being executed by the Grenada Coral Reef Foundation is showing success in the growing of coral reef by using electric current which is passed between underwater metal electrodes.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Currently we are developing a knowledge management strategy which will enable us to target stakeholders specifically which would allow us to share very targeted insights to the right audience. These knowledge products will include policy briefs, Infographics, snap videos and knowledge kits.



> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Baseline data in the blue economy especially imagery is missing and because of the rise in sea temperatures lots of changes are occurring. The absence of baseline data in this area affects our ability to truly understand and evaluate the changes occurring. This is why our underwater monitoring project is important and critical. 



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The solution to this was not clear and therefore we had to try several approaches to identify the optimal one. Therefore rapid prototyping was used to identify the best method Artificial inteligence will be used to analyse the data and information being collected. Hackathons were used to identify the deployment method and to capture ideas from youth and the ministry on how it could be deployed.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Our visioning and future thinking exercises have enabled us to tap into different modes of thinking which bring participants and stakeholders into the future helping them to forget the policies and restrictions which limits them.

Demonstration one of our previous projects in VR before we begin to brainstorm helps participants innovators to be in the space for sharing future thoughts enabling them to think big.
