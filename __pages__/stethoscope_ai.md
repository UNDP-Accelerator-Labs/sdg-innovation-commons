> Title of the innovation

Stethoscope ai

> Brief description of the innovation

We all know COVID19 is extremely contagious by now, and shortage in healthcare provider is already happening in first world, this would only further escalate in 3rd world nations who do not have much resources. By being part of UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, we want to innovate in this area and able to be able to help everyone in the world. So my goal is to build something that can help with COVID19 and other related challenges respectively.
So I want to build an open sourced digital stethoscopes that's under Normal pricing and can easily be given to everyone in the world, so that we can empower doctors via telemedicine to treat more people

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Heart diseases are the number one cause of deaths globally, with three-quarters occurring in developing countries (WHO). Heart diseases have emerged as the single most important cause of deaths worldwide. 
 ◦ My goal was to develop a portable, low-cost system that can be used by untrained frontline health-workers for early detection of valvular heart abnormalities such as murmurs, which claim millions of lives every year.

> Technical Feasibility

Using Artificial Intelligence, Cloud and Mobile, A simulated stethoscope-based cardiac auscultation done by trained doctors for early diagnosis. I developed a novel automated technique to detect abnormal heartbeat patterns by applying audio pre-processing algorithms to stethoscope sounds, converting into high-quality spectrograms and classifying with state-of-the-art Cloud-based Neural Networks trained with normal and abnormal heart sounds.

> Anticipated Social Impact

it can be deployed as a holistic diagnostic tool to improve rural healthcare, reduce the unnecessary equipments used for diagnostic and testing and help in the early detection of diseases eg heart attacks and the novel covid 19
In this project, we will also train an AI to use sound classification , and when the AI detects possible symptoms. More accurate results will be given reducing mislead information given by  physicians and medical professionals
