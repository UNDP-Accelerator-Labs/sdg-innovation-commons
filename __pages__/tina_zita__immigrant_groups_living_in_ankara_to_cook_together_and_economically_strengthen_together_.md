Tina Zita: Is a social initiative that enables immigrant groups living in Ankara to cook together and economically strengthen together. By creating menus suitable for the cooking skills of various immigrant groups, it creates an area where immigrant individuals and groups can realize their skills by providing them active employment with the income it earns from the catering service provided in Ankara.
