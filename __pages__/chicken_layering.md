> Title of the innovation

Chicken Layering

> Brief description of the innovation

Kasempa  is one of the districts of North-western province of Zambia with the main entrepreneurial activity being farming.
Despite the high depend of eggs within the district, Kasempa has no farmer that can take up the responsibility of keeping layers that would be a source of eggs for the district (increasing the gross domestic product)
My idea is to establish a poultry house mainly for the supply of eggs within Kasempa.This will benefit the Locals.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Eggs are on high demand in Kasempa  and the rate at which they are consumed is really a guarantee that profit would be generated.
Due to the high demand and low supply of eggs in Kasempa,the price of eggs tends to be high  but if this is done locally, supply would surpass demand and the prices will drastically reduce contributing to the economy of the country.

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype is actually very common as this activity has been exercised all over Zambia but kasempa just seems to be one of those few places with little or no knowledge on the benefits of such activities.
This plan is to be excuted by first building a small house to serve as a poultry house  with about 500 layers then later expand to a bigger thing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Eggs are highly nutritious, the society would benefit in such a way that the abundance of eggs in the district will help stop nutritional disorders such as kwashiorkor.Small scale business men would buy and resale, this will generate income for them too.
