Hello Erf is an Agri-tech solution that aims to solve smallholders' challenge to access mechanization service through a direct call to our call centre or through our agents in their village. The solution also helps mechanization service providers to manage and grow their business. Service providers through an IoT powered mobile app will track and monitor their machineries, revenue and manage bookings from smallholder farmers. It also provides up to date research findings, suppliers address, events, and professionals and so on within the agriculture mechanization ecosystem. Applying human centered design approach has helped us to go through discussions with farmers, service providers, sector experts in public sector along with those working in NGOs in search of the problem on the ground and how they think will be solved. Though the problem to be solved are a bit difficult and ranging difference in literacy level, mobile device types of users were complicated. Years of experience of the team in the Agri-tech industry has helped to come to reach into innovative and inclusive solution to be provided. Hello Erf is winner of the 2018 innovation slam award by Green Innovation Center, GIZ project promoting innovative solutions transforming agriculture.
