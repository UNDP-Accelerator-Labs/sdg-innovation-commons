Addressing flooding in the suburbs of Dakar (Senegal): integrated management framework, socio-economic impacts and innovative solutions
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

In Senegal, floods are a major and recurring issue heavily impacting urban infrastructure but also causes considerable damages specifically on vulnerable populations living in the suburbs of Dakar. Exacerbated by climate change, the non-integration of rainwater management in urban planning and a non-effective flood management framework, floods are more frequent with more than 500,000 people affected and losses amounting 204 million dollars. We are trying to influence policies for a more effective collaborative framework on floods management involving all existing and potential stakeholders. In addition to that, we seek to highlight areas where urgent actions are needed in terms of better access to social services for most vulnerable groups particularly women and youth. Also, we will explore how to turn excess rainwater fall into opportunity while mapping all existing and potential solutions around flood management including grassroots, technological and technical (urban planning).  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Flooding is one of the most serious problems Senegal has been facing, making it a serious concern for Government over the last four decades. Flooding affects both urban, peri-urban and rural areas. The negative impact of flooding during 2005, 2009 and 2012 and more recently during last September 2020, continue to be reflected in existing socio-economic conditions. The geographical position of the country and the limits in the risk prevention framework, in a worsening climate context, exposes to flooding risks. Despite a relevant legal framework reinforced by a decennial management program (2012-2022) and nearly 1.3 billion dollars invested, the interventions are still inoperative in large portions of the sub-urban areas. The shortcomings are mainly due to some unpreparedness that affected the response coordination mechanism. Between 1970 and 2000, the country suffered prolonged droughts that contributed to rural exodus. Today, almost half of Senegal’s population lives in urban areas; over 76 percent of these areas are classified as unplanned settlements. The impact of floods in this situation of uncontrolled urban growth is exacerbated by the lack of a functional storm water drainage system, ineffective land-use policies and non-compliance with the urban planning and development master plan. Apart from the Government, different actors are involved in this challenge including the international development partners, NGO’s, local communities and authorities, etc. Communities in peri-urban areas already among the poorest in the country, are the most vulnerable to episodes of heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding. Aside from the tragic loss of human lives, infrastructure, houses and other property, was destroyed. The agricultural sector has also suffered from destruction of irrigation networks and loss of crops. During flooding episodes of 2005, 2009 and 2012, around 500,000 people were impacted with estimated damages and losses amounting 204 million dollars. In the most recent flooding occurrence during September 2020, more than 21,000 people were directly impacted.

The qualitative data (life stories) from the socio-economic survey of the floods shows the magnitude and urgency of the phenomenon. By way of illustration, the qualitative data reveals the social malaise resulting from the floods: divorce, gender based violences, prostitution, loss of jobs for some youth, compromised education for children.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Senegal Accelerator Lab intends to explore the grassroots solutions and, at the same time, initiate actions to foster a better coherence of the public and private interventions. We will interrogate the efficiency of already deployed policies and analyze the socio-economic impacts of floods on gender, youth and family related aspects (potential or existing impacts). The accelerator intends to bring value in filling the knowledge gap around the floods in Senegal and to the search of solutions that consider the existing adaptation mechanisms of grassroots communities. The portfolio approach will allow us to learn from what works and what does not and to accelerate the most adapted solutions to this complex and multiform challenge. It will also be necessary to involve unusual suspects from the innovation ecosystem, start-ups and youth, to promote more agile ways of addressing the challenge.

## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

Local communities: We are working with local communities affected by floods to not only help measure the socio-economic impacts but also to mobilize innovative solutions proposed by these communities. We have established partnerships with communities such as Djeddah Thiaroye Kaw, Pikine, Guediawaye, Keur Massar etc. to use case studies and organize forums around flooding.

Government: Through government agencies (ANAT, DPC etc.) and some ministries, we are establishing a partnership to establish an integrated flood management framework and a socio-economic recovery plan for the affected populations.

Private sector: With the private sector (telecoms, banks, insurance), we want to establish a partnership to mobilize new sources of data (big data and artificial intelligence) to better address floods challenge.  

Academia: We collaborate with the academic world to initiate practical research applied to floods and mobilize data to inform decisions.

Innovation ecosystem: We are partnering with start-ups, incubators, accelerators, labs etc. to find innovative, open, actionable and cross-fertilized solutions to address the issue of flooding.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Learning question 1: Why actions around flood management are not efficient? We are trying to understand the drivers behind the lack of effectiveness and efficiency of efforts deployed despite the Government’s strong commitment and desire to find a sustainable and effective solution to recurrent flooding. Who are the involved stakeholders? What are their roles? Which actions have been undertaken? How are local authorities and communities involved? Who else should be involved? What added value could they bring? We are trying to influence policies to foster a more effective collaborative framework on floods management involving all existing and potential stakeholders.  Learning question 2: What are the socio-economic impacts on local communities? Understanding how local communities are affected in terms of gender relations implications, impacts on the education of affected children, health risks will be useful advocacy indicators in defining targets, policies and priority of actions. How are local communities affected? What are the impacts on gender relations? How are children and youth affected? What are the health risks for affected populations? How is the education, and other domains affected? We are trying to influence the policy making process by highlighting areas where urgent actions are needed in terms of better access to social services for most vulnerable groups particularly women and youth.  Learning question 3: Which solutions could we consider for a proactive flood management approach ? We are trying to explore how to turn excess rainwater fall into opportunity while mapping all existing and potential solutions around flood management including grassroots, technological and technical (urban planning) innovations. What are grassroots solutions? What are the technological solutions? What other solutions (Institutional, Legal, Housing, urban planning..) could be considered? How to turn excess rain water fall into opportunity? We are trying to explore how to turn excess rainwater fall into opportunity while mapping all existing and potential solutions around flood management including grassroots, technological and technical (urban planning) innovations.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Flooding is a recurrent and complex problem in Senegal. To face this complexity and generate innovative solutions, it is necessary to triangulate sources and methods. To do this, in addition to traditional methods, we have found it necessary to experiment with new methods, both quantitative and qualitative (particularly those focused on humans and communities). These methods will contribute to add value to flood management, especially in terms of socio-economic impacts and solutions, including grassroots solutions. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The review of studies undertaken so far shows that big data and artificial intelligence have been very little mobilized in flood management in Senegal. With this in mind, we believe we can explore AI and massive data as new data sources. For this, in addition to ethnography and other methods, we intend to explore data collaborative as a new method used not only to generate new data but also help to design applications and or feed existing risk management platforms, including those related to floods. Geospatial data (GIS, GPS,) will strengthen the early warning system and allow better interaction between populations and decision makers. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We believe that local communities will benefit most from this project. Indeed, the establishment of a management framework will help make actions and interventions more focused and effective. In addition, an in-depth knowledge of floods will help to design a socio-economic recovery plan to better help the affected populations get out of the difficulties they face on a daily basis. Finally, innovative solutions, in this case from grassroots communities, can be tested, implemented and scaled up.

At the grow stage, we will collaborate with unusual actors such as private companies, academia, innovation ecosystems (start-ups, labs, incubators, accelerators, etc.) in order to mobilize new sources of data (big data from social media, private companies) useful to better understand the flooding phenomenon and deploy innovative solutions. These solutions will result from the design of applications and artificial intelligence systems in order to reinforce the effectiveness of existing systems such as the early warning system and geographic information systems.
