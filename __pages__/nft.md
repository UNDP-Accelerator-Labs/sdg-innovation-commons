Description: It is a technique where nutrients are pumped from a reservoir, and it is not necessary to manipulate plants.

This technique ensures the safety of the products, since it occurs inside large greenhouses that regulate the temperature and also protect crops from diseases or insects that may affect the crop.  

Interesting features: Many plants can be grown in small spaces, since horizontal or vertical systems can be made, depending on the amount of space available.
