> Title of the innovation

Energy recovery system. The system that will recover energy from the environment... And 2. Education platform..  this will help improving education system in Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Education system will be the system which will allow learners to access materials and if possible can complete there learning process before the stipulated time by the board  ecz

Energy systems in Zambia we use the naturally occurring energy without minding the effects it will have on ecosystem and people the good example is then the mines stops to operate... In Zambia they usually close and that environment is completely damage such that you can't do anything from it.. hence we need a system that can stabilize such kind of situation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We have two projects, education and energy recovery system... Education generate money by how frequently people access the platform.. 

For energy by utilization of some waste product with the combination of other resources we make the product useable and hence we can sale the product

> Technical Feasibility

Not yet made a prototype.. but it will be the best system for Zambia and it's environment

> Anticipated Social Impact

Education is the best investment but in Zambia is the longest process.. people's lives become better at old ages.. the system need to be modernized

> Name of the Innovator

Innocent Tera-link-X

> Age

- 19-35
