> Title of the innovation

Hydroponic Farming

> Brief description of the innovation

Growing crops on a large scale using water based medium's.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will allow us to grow crops all year round without being limited by climate changes ensuring constant food supply.

> Technical Feasibility

Hydroponic is designed in a way in which plants grow with thier roots submerged directly in nutrient-rich water.  On a commercial level, farmers oat  use rafts which float on a large bed of wster, these work like conveyor belt with young plants added on one side, they will move along until ready for harvert at the other side.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation has been tested in other countries here in Africa and around the world to improve production of crops with high quality. Hydroponics is very relevant to the current market as farmers grow can grow whatever os on demand without worrying about the current season.
