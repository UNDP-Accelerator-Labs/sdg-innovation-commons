Collaborative Project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.

Overall goal:  Conduct a collaborative study across Argentina, on the coasts of the sea, rivers and lakes, to analyze the presence, amount and composition of microplastics through a systematic and massive survey.    Specific goals:  Study plastic items between 1 mm and 25 mm in size and disclose the results to society as a whole in order to provide crucial information that serves to measure the issue and find solutions.  Compare data with the rest of the world using The Big Microplastic Survey project undertaken by conservation charity Just One Ocean. The purpose of this study is to gather global information on the most frequent microplastics found in the coastal sites of seas, lakes and rivers, to promote comprehensive conservation on the planet. 

Description of citizen participation.Students or anyone interested can participate in the project, and after receiving information or with the coordination of a sampling supervisor, they are in charge of recording the data and analyzing the samples. Following a simple and systematic scientific sampling protocol, they collect information from those plastic items ranging in size from 1 mm to 25 mm found in coastal sites of seas, lakes and rivers, and report the results. Citizens are responsible for classifying samples into primary and secondary microplastics, type and size of plastics, amount and presence of other components (e.g., cigarette butts) in the samples, if any. Samples are collected along the shoreline, parallel to the water. The position (GPS coordinates) of part of the sample, which is recorded as the position, should be captured.
