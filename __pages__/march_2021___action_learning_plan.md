## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Kazakhstan Action Learning Plan (March 2021)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that current distribution of public budgets in mass sport activities is prone to corruption risks and favouritism. We aim at piloting a digital mechanism that involves citizens’ participation in rating to reduce these corruption risks and provide transparency. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The context around the challenge is evolving around the recent governmental changes in financing sports activities in Kazakhstan. This change, which took place in September 2020, redirected a large amount of funds (25 billion KZT or over 58 million USD) from financing professional sports to mass sports among children and youth. The driver of this change is that in spite of large funding allocated from the government to professional sport clubs, their performance continues to deteriorate. For example, according to the FIFA ranking, Kazakhstan ranked 98th (2001) and dropped down even lower - 122nd place - in 2021. Guaranteed funding from the government prevents professional sport clubs to improve their efficiency as there is no motivation to do so.    International experience shows that it is more efficient to support mass sport among children and youth rather than professional sports. Considering the above, the President of Kazakhstan issued an order on efficient budget distribution per capita. The Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations, and Aerospace industry (“Ministry” from now on) expressed the need to develop a new mechanism for budget distribution to mass sport with the goal of decreasing corruption risks and providing budget transparency.   Making larger funds available for children and youth across the country will contribute to creating an environment favourable for engagement in sport activities more actively. In turn, this will lead to better education and health outcomes.  

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Currently 10 billion KZT is an annual budget allocated for governmental mass sport and arts organizations. Additionally, 25 billion KZT will be allocated for private mass sport and arts organizations. According to the National Statistics 2M children (30% of total number of children) are engaged in mass sport sections.

Decisions produced by the government often produce negative sentiments among the public. The Presidential order on directing a large amount of funds from one area to another is creating public distrust and doubts on how well these funds will be managed when allocating per capita funding. As the final receivers of funds are MSMEs providing sports activities across the country, people may feel that the government is favouring one service provider over the other. That is why this transparent citizen-led mechanism of budget distribution is key to show people in a transparent way where the funds are going.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Accelerator Lab team proposed to the Ministry to develop a scoring system which will automatically distribute funds based on several criteria such as performance indicators of sport facilities, accountability, financial and legal history, and citizens’ feedback on quality of services rendered. This topic is crosscutting as it covers UNDP focus areas such as digitalisation, human capital, local development, and citizen participation. The developed mechanism can be scaled up to other areas that require budget distribution. The Country office is aware and supportive of the Accelerator Lab working on this challenge.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Together with the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations, and Aerospace Industry, we are creating a citizen-empowered mechanism to rank service providers and ensure fair budget distribution. Our experiment will be in the area of sports that we hope to scale up further!

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What digital system can be introduced to ensure transparency and fairness in the evaluation of MSMEs that would be funded by the new government funding scheme?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use these innovative tools to create a scoring system based on the AI/ ML algorithms. We are working together with the private companies that are non-traditional actors for the UNDP aiming to co-create this scoring system. During the process, we will map existing solutions and create our own prototype for testing and scaling.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We lack information on actual children attendance of sport facilities. Background historical data (geospatial, financial) and real time citizen data (citizen network, feedback) will contribute to the scoring system as a way of data empowerment - the citizens will benefit from the data they generate themselves.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Our key beneficiaries are citizens and SMEs. We see the Ministry of Digital development, Innovations, and Aerospace industry as a main champion as they are owners of the system and are responsible to implement the solution across the country.
