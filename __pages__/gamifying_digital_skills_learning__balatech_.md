## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

With users' data, generate key recommendations on engaging youth in digital skills learning through gamification

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF the learning content is gamified, THEN students are engaged in studying.
IF the UX design is gender sensitive, THEN more girls are attracted to the platform. 
IF the learning is challenge-based, THEN students are more motivated to study with their peers.
