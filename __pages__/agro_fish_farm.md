Agro Fish Farm is company that is engaged in fish farming business. Our major challenge is the lack of fish feed and unfortunate for us we do not have anyone that is producing it in Sierra Leone. So for that reason our solution is a simple and smart method to manage biodegradable waste, while at the same time providing organic and healthy animal feed and fertilizer at cheaper prices. We collect the degradable waste, which is typically household waste such unwanted leftover food and kitchen waste, and place it in a moisture container and leave an opening that allows the black soldier fly to come in and feed on the waste. In that process, they will lay eggs that grow into maggots. The overall process takes one week and the amount of waste the black soldier fly eats is proportional to the maggot it produces. This maggot can then begin to serve as feed for animals such chickens, duck and even in production of fish feed.
