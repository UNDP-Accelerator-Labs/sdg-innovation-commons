> Title of the innovation

Chicken rearing for life

> Brief description of the innovation

I have decided to start rearing chickens. These are sasol chickens and I keep them specifically for eggs. I have 48 so far and 10 are laying.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will generate income from this project by seeling eggs and chicks. Currently a fertilized egg in my locality is fetching k4. That means k4 multiply with the number of eggs I have in a week or month. A one week cheick is k25. That means if I decide to take for hatching, it may also give me good profit.

> Technical Feasibility

The chickens are kept within our yard.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Already my neighbors are nolonger walking long distances to buy eggs. They buy from us.
