> Title of the innovation

improving soil in agriculture

> Brief description of the innovation

Employ the power of roots to break up heavy soils and add organic matter. Plant marigolds, zinnias, or other annuals in new gardens, cutting them off at ground level at the end of the season. The roots rot in the soil, improving soil structure. By Peggy Anne Montgomery.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Better soil fertility will support increased production, improve farm income and enhance environmental performance on the farm.

Correcting soil fertility can allow growth for 25% more grass. Fertilizers losses can contribute to your farm’s greenhouse gas emissions and impact on water and air quality.

Improving soil fertility through nutrient management can also have environmental benefits. If nutrients are applied where they are most needed on the farm, they will be more readily absorbed by the soil preventing losses to the air and water.

> Technical Feasibility

The purpose of this study is to study a feasibility of using an Electrochemical technique for improving soil mechanical properties. The experiment is performed on a use of DC current applied to a cell that contains the soil between anolyte and Catholyte solutions. As a result, it is found that there is the feasibility of using an Electrochemical technique to improve the soil mechanical properties. Increase in strength up to 300 kPa from almost cannot resist any applied load of kaolin soil can be obtained after treated by the Electrochemical technique.

> Anticipated Social Impact

it can help other to also improve there soil
