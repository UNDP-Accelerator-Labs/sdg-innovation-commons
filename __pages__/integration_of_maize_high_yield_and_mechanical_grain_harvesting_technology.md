> Description of the solution

This solution was led by  Crop Cultivation and Physiology Innovation Team at the Institute of Crop Sciences of CAAS. They used the innovative technology of quantitatively matching the drying performance of maize varieties with regional ecological conditions, enabling low-crushing grain harvest. By integrating this with high-yield cultivation technology under dense planting, they synergistically improved maize yield and production benefit.
The technology has been widely applied and popularized across the country, leading the development of modern maize production in China.
