> Title of the innovation

Easy Make for Sufficient Growth Organic Fertilizer.

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is an organic Fertilizer that covers all the elements found in chemically made fertilizers ... elements such as NPK (Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium)..my fertilizer is made out of organic material such as banana peals , egg shells and alittle amount of chicken dung  which be used as individual fertilizers but will only contain one of the elements found in chemically made Fertilizers and the I deal behind is to combine and make organically a Fertilizer that can contain all three with other elements as well.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Looking at my residential area which is in Peri-Urban and is populated by small and large scale farms My innovation will create business for the farmers keeping chickens and those that grow bananas for the innovation will require me to buy things like chicken dung from them there for creating business for the small scale farmers and the other raw materials needed can be obtained from boarding schools as wastes therefore reusing instead of wasting. My target market is the small and large scale farmers around my area those that are unable to find money to buy the chemically made fertilizers and have only agriculture as the source of food and income for there families maybe for the children's education. The challenge prize will help  me implement the innovation and be able to help my society and other societies at large grow in agriculture. My Fertilizer is organically made therefore will not cause death of aquatic life in that chemically made fertilizers when washed in rivers by rains are able to pollute the water and resulting to death of aquatic life, secondly the fertilizer reduces  the increased acidity levels in the soil caused by chemically made Fertilizers because of the balance in the natural materials used.

> Technical Feasibility

My Fertilizer is made up of three raw materials namely banana peals,egg shells and alittle chicken dung which are dried and later crushed to powder the three powders are then mixed with chicken dung having the least quantity and it's done can either be used as powder like that or made into a liquid just by adding water. My innovation can be given to farmers locally to be put in things such as tomatoes at nursery level or just vegetables.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Firstly the innovation will create business to small scale farmers specifically those keeping chickens for they will be selling the chicken dung for the manufacturing of the fertilizer. Secondly if the Fertilizer is said to be produced at large it will provide employment for fellow youths that don't have anything to do that can help in the making and packaging of the fertilizer. thirdly the Fertilizer will be easily available even for those doing house gardening and very affordable therefore creating food for people.lastly looking at the current economy and the poverty levels in the country and how there is an increase In D-compound and Urea fertilizer prices creating a locally made fertilizer and made out of material that some people actually throw as waste products and making something useful that will be sold at a very affordable price and has less effects on plants and environment will be very relevant.
