> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Am a safety and health worker in a construction company. That's why I need have recommendations on improving the construction industry in zambia. The construction industry looks to be a small sector in Zambia. But it is quit big. And I hope rocommedations will help improve our industry.

> Technical Feasibility

My first innovation plans are to ensure all construction workers are registered. That's is to show the accuracy and to help plan. Construction workers mostly work on contact hence their very few or non in permanent employment in the construction industry. So I wish to open an organisation to be helping construction workers when they loss there works before they find new work.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Imagine where sameone start working in a project for a year before your well setold the project is done. Then when you start looking for new job you need to pay rent, trasport money as you move about, food and other stuff. I once suffered in 2018 when I lot my work and to make matters west I was attacked and robbed. So my hospital bills and a lot of things. I sold most of my property even my car. That's why I need to came up with an organization which can be helping people who were in employment and they are looking for new jobs.
