> Brief description of the innovation

We do quality smoked products 
Smoked chicken k120
Smoked fish k130 for 3
Smoked product's brought by you k10 per kg

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My target is during seasons where functions are plenty, many people want smoked food's and so supplying them at an affordable price with a guarantee that they are fresh and from nearby neighbouring farms will give people healthier food and in turn I gt to earn more that will help me invest more into my other projects like herb growing, therapeutic scented candles and finally get into farming.

> Technical Feasibility

I'm using smoking machine that I bought but I'm planning to have an inbuilt one in future that can do more food at a go

> Anticipated Social Impact

Once food is affordable it's bound to improve on the livelihood of many and also when we look at my pricing, I believe when commodities are affordable I can reduce prices so that people with lower pay too can easily afford
