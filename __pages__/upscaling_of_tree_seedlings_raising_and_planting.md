> Brief description of the innovation

This project therefore seeks to solve the problem of land degradation and other environmental challenges through the upscaling of tree planting of various species in the ares, train the local farmers on how to undertake tree planting as a business in the fight against climate change thereby making them self reliant and sustaining ,
 The project also seek to impower 40% of the women in the area with knowledge of natural resources management with the right kind of training and assistance we believe women can make better natural resource managers who will ensure sustainable use of use for today and for the future,
  When all this is said and done , it's our anticipation that we will be able to create to form tree planting champions who will plant more trees and make greener, carbon free environment for the people of Choma the province and the country as a whole.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income generation will ensure the smooth running of the company that's why our major project goal is to upscale in terms tree seedling production to meet the various demands for the district, province,country and the world and these demand range  from improved or smart Agri culture,agro forestry,acoustic tree planting for the beautification of the district , all this being said this project will basically benefit the raising demand for trees and the balance between us  the suppliers and buyer will remain intact to improve both parties operations,

> Technical Feasibility

Our prototype is naturally occurring and readily available in form of natures filter system (trees) they will greatly bring balance to ecosystem cause the best way to curb and alleviate and potentially reverse the effects of climate change is using nature,
  Plants of different uses or multi-purpose trees such as pine,palm trees,been trees weepingwillow,acacia plants,pod mahogany,red mahogany,fycus, eucalyptus,moringa and jacaranda trees are on our implementation plan,
Edible fruit bearing trees are like mangoes pawpaw,lemon, orange,avocado,guava plants will also help In our implements.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will greatly improve the lives of a lot of people in the case of job creation will help a lot of families and improve standards of living and we will act as a tool in poverty alleviation amongst locals,
  In the case of planting edible fruit bearing plants a lot of dietary needs will be catered for , because of the rich vitamin levels of fruit which in turn will improve health, cause health is wealth and health people means healthy work ethics and healthy plants and a health world
   Greener communities will decrease the mushrooming carbon levels and other toxic substances in the ecosystem 
   When all these and more are tackled livelihoods will greatly improve
  The market is in dire need of new innovations to stop climate change and the most readily available and cheap and manageable tools for helping our stricken world are trees so alot of people opt for this kind of innovation for greener tomorrow
