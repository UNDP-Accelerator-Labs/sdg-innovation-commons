Globally, the effort for solving waste tyre problems through market-based value-adding waste tyre management options is as old as tyre itself. These include reusing, de-vulcanization, mechanical and thermal (including pyrolysis) processing. Disposal options such as land filling and stockpiling are also practiced.  Tyre pyrolysis is a thermal process carried out in the absence of oxygen for producing oil, carbon char black and gases from used tyres and recovering the steel wires in the tyre. This presents an opportunity to consider scrap tyre pyrolysis as a business. Pyrolysis is emerging as a more efficient way to utilize the resources in scrap tyres compared to the other options. From pyrolysis of scrap tyres, four products are obtained: oil, carbon char, fuel gas and steel wire. Pyrolysis is preferable because of the following reasons: It recycles 100% of the waste tyres. All valuable materials are extracted. It  produces  four  valuable  products  out  of  waste  tyres  with  no  effect  on  the environment. They are “green” products. There exists a huge and increasing demand for the products. It delivers clean steel after processing than other technologies. The pyrolysis machine can be design and manufacture locally
