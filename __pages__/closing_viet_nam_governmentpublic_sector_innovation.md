## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Government officials are very busy with their work but still open to new learning opportunities if they feel those can benefit their work, especially if it aligns with their personal interests. This disproves the assumption that government agencies will only engage in projects with high monetary incentives.  Government officials at first get impatient when experiencing participatory ethnographic research for the first time, but gradually they respect the learning coming out of it Not only do government partners benefit from the governance innovation projects by the Lab, but Country Office staff also learn a lot from co-designing and implementing governance innovation approaches with the Lab. The need to understand local government leaders, political priorities, economic incentives and plan accordingly with UNDP's own capacity for best effect. In complex emerging countries such as Viet Nam, officials of any importance are often juggling a number of projects, partners, and more. In innovation, we typically have a positive “just do it” attitude. Which is good to get things started, but few can commit to seeing the whole process.  Being able to invest/back the right committed government champion can ensure sustainability and positive social impact. Taking on new innovation initiatives is politically risky, time-consuming and an uphill battle for most officials who want to champion different ways of doing it. The best support UNDP AccLab can give to these individuals is to be a partner/co-doer. Meaning sharing timely connections, recognition, knowledge on latest practices, emotional support, and sometimes tactical seed funding to ease their risks and increase their chances of success

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Government structure and culture are bureaucratic. Hence, implementing any new practices takes a lot of time. Government officials are really busy and underpaid, which makes it harder to engage them in learning activities or things that would need extra effort without immediate reward. AccLab Projects’ size and scope are often small, it is unlikely to demonstrate systems change in the short term (if we can even define what system change means). We have to split up our small budget in many areas while often having overbearing high expectations.  Innovation is a broad concept, it can empower people to start and try new things. At the same time,  from an ethical and neutrality standpoint, UNDP needs to be careful on what kind of innovation narrative we are pushing. From an international development perspective, more often than not, innovative initiatives are co-opted to drive self-interest/agenda (such as gaining visibility, commercialization of developed countries technology, bringing donors money through atlas…), techno-solutionism (UNDP end up as a marketing front for the global north to export technology to the global south). Ultimately reinforcing global north power hegemony (exporting imperial core neoliberal capitalism values) and further creating inequality. Innovation needs to respect historical development context, diversity in what innovation looks like in another context, and not just “try something new” for the sake of getting the rest of the world to look more like the west, or as a marketing front for Silicon-valley innovation narrative that tends to create deep inequality. We should acknowledge our own biases and be careful not to back the wrong horse. Public procurement is a huge barrier. It is currently not set up to incentivize risk-taking and adequately reward the extra effort needed for innovative breakthroughs.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used this because governments mostly make policies from top-down approach, but lacking information of what citizens think and feel. We want to engage government officials in experiencing what is like for citizens to use public services.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Yes, as participatory ethnographic research method helps government officials to experience what it’s like for citizens to use public services, collective intelligence helps to explore different problems as well as solutions for public challenges and policy experiments help government officials to test what works what doesn’t before actually writing concrete policy documents
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with 2 national universities National Economic Universities on Anticipatory governance and Foreign Trade University on Circular economy training of trainers and Business bootcamp

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

DNES Danang Incubation Hub - a private-public partnership to build an innovation ecosystem in Danang on Circular Economy Hub. DNES was the implementing partner of the CE incubation program and policy-advise for DISED on behalf of the business community.  Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation (JAMSS) a space remote sensing company that won the Japan Innovation Challenge. In partnership with DISED (Danang gov think tank), JAMSS prototyped their remote sensing technology to detect plastic waste and water pollution hotspot in Danang to aid in municipal evaluation and monitoring effort.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

National Innovation Center - build capacity on SME innovation policy & innovation strategy for the organization Thua Thien Hue government  - support the improvement of the Online public service portal through ethnographic research and experiments Da Nang Institute for Socio-Economic Development (DISED) on 2 initiatives: 1. CityLab night-time economy - apply collective intelligence to crowdsource ideas from artist communities on building better night-time experiences in the City & carry out experiments with some of these ideas. 2. Developing a Circular Economy Roadmap using the groundwork from AccLab initial waste experimentation, informal waste economy and DN Circular Economy Hub. Mobilized additional funding and support from Japan Unit and Finnish embassy
