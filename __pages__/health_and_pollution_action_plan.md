> Description of the solution

The Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP) has supported 13 countries developing a Health and Pollution Action Plan (HPAP). The goal of each HPAP is to establish pollution as a policy priority and to define and advance concrete actions to reduce exposure to pollution and its related health impacts. GAHP works with national and regional governments by bringing together stakeholders in government, civil society, and the private sector to develop and implement the HPAPs. The HPAP process is flexible and tailored to the needs of each country, but generally includes five steps: Data Collection and Analysis, Setting health based priorities for action on pollution, Preparation of a draft Action Plan, Stakeholder consultation and Implementation.
