Its appearance and texture is earthy and granular, resembling soil. It has a dark color due to the high content of decomposed organic matter. In its final stage, it should be relatively dry and should not give off any bad aroma.

Depending on the type of organic matter that has been used in the composting process, solid compost is full of essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other micronutrients, which are beneficial for plant growth. In addition to its chemical components, its physical characteristics make it excellent for improving soil oxygenation, moisture retention and protection against the sun's rays.  

It is used to remedy worn soil, to perform pylons transplants and to apply on the roots of the plant directly.
