This technique consists of making concentrates of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms beneficial to the composting process. These liquid concentrates speed up the composting process and also add nutrient value to the final result.  

This type of mixture can be purchased directly from an agronomic services distributor or can be done through field cultivation of mountain microorganisms.
