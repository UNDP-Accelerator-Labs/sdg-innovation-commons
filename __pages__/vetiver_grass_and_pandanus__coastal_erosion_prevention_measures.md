Innovators: Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD)

Narrative: The threat of climate change is a real concern to the beautiful beaches of Ifira Island. With the help of the Ifira community and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Vetiver grass were planted along the coastal areas to help prevent sea sprays, prevent sand mining, it acts as windbreakers, trap sediments thus preventing coastal erosion. It is a cheap and locally available method that can minimize the negative impacts of Sea Level Rise. Every coastal community should adapt this soft measure.
