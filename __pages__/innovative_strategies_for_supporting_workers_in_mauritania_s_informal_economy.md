## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

- Entrepreneurship and the promotion of informal actors: In collaboration with the ILO, we identified the importance of entrepreneurship in promoting informal actors. The goal is to help formalize the informal economy and create sustainable jobs.


- Promoting access to finance for informal actors: We learned that access to finance is crucial for informal actors. This can enable informal actors to invest in and grow their businesses.

- Capacity building and awareness: We learned that capacity building and awareness are essential to helping informal actors understand their rights and cope with the economic system.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Discussions are ongoing with the ILO and the Direction de l’Appui à la Formalisation. It is maintained to launch the innovation challenge in January.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The data types were chosen because of the observed gaps in the available data regarding Mauritania’s informal economy and also to provide insights that would shape our intervention. For example, we decided that an innovation challenge around the key informality challenges would be a pertinent approach :

- Informal Conversations: These provided insights into the experiences and challenges of informal workers, which are often not captured in formal data.

- Interviews: allowed for the collection of detailed, qualitative information from a diverse range of stakeholders within the informal economy.

- Literature Review and Document Analysis: This helped to understand the context and historical background of the informal economy in Mauritania.

- Socioeconomic Data: Provided a statistical source for the understanding of the informal economy, such as the informal employment and poverty, etc.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Solution Mapping: allowed us to identify potential solutions, ensuring that the innovation challenge we decided on was relevant and addressed the issues faced by informal workers in Mauritania.

Exploration: This method helped us delve deeper into the informal economy, exploring the complexities of the challenge.

Horizon Scanning: enabled aligning our innovation challenge with the evolving needs of the sector.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By combining different perspectives and expertise, we identified innovative solutions tailored to the informal economy and understood the pertinence of the innovation challenges to help in addressing the challenge of informality. The diverse data sources we used led to a better understanding of the informal sector, leading to a more informed event organisation.
