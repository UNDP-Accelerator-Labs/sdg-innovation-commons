The Bangladesh Accelerator Lab organized a Women’s Digital Innovation hackathon to promote ICT skills and innovation practices to female students and professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of SDG challenges. One of the solutions that came out of the hackathon is Eco360 - a mobile application that keeps record of its users’ household plastic consumption. It would determine a footprint potential and make graphical comparisons to encourage cutting down unnecessary plastic usage. Eco360 booths would be located at major residential areas for collection of its users’ household plastic wastes. A monthly push notification would be sent to users as deposition reminder. Depositors would receive reward points according to plastic type (single-use or multiple-use) and waste amount. These points could be used as e-currency. The picture shows the members of the team that designed this solution.
