## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The intent is to test whether useful digital tools could be effective tools to collect data for policymaking. In this case, applied to the problem of young informal work.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF the platform is useful for young informal workers THEN we will be able to collect relevant data for youth policy making.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1.    Disseminate the platform (disruptive communication strategy) to have active users 2.       Generate a network of allies to use the platform`s data for policy making 3.       Reiterate and improve the platform function based on users ‘feedback
