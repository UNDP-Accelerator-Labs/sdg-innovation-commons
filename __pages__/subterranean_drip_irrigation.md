Description: Underground drip irrigation is a method that involves applying water under the soil surface. To install this type of irrigation heavy machinery is necessary since several trenches need to be opened on the sides of the crops, in order to install pipes, pumps, etc. 

Through automated processes, the flow and amount of water that plants receive directly into the roots can be regulated.   

Interesting feature: Reduces the amount of water evaporation that happens and allows you to make better use of irrigation.
