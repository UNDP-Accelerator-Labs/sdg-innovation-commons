> Title of the innovation

Sustainable Nutrition for All

> Brief description of the innovation

Our solution is turn organic food waste into sustainable and inexpensive livestock feed and fertilizer for small and medium scale chicken, fish and pig farmers by farming the Black Soldier fly for its larvae.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will sell livestock feed and fertilizer to small and medium scale farmers as well as small pet owners. We will also focus on empowering women and youth through our out grower insect scheme. This will see an increase in employment as well. Our future revenue streams include products for human consumption and cosmetics. Our potential off-takers include chicken, fish and pig farmers and our beachhead market is primarily Lusaka and the rest of Zambia with expansion to countries like Tanzania, Zimbabwe and DRC where we have already received interest in our product through a Letter of intent. 

The challenge prize money will help increase our monthly capacity which will in turn see more employees, increased organic growth and an consequently an increased share in the market. 

Our solution is to turn food waste into inexpensive and sustainable feed and fertilizer for farmers who are currently unable to afford the ever increasing feed prices. Not only is our product higher in protein at 43% than soya Beans at 35%, it also reduces the carbon foot print by the use of waste, making it good for the environment. By 2070, initiates like ours can see a decrease in CO2 by up to 70%

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is mainly manual but we would like it technologically enabled. The breeding, harvesting and processing will be done in an indoor insectarium. We have recently acquired a microwave dryer for the processing of our product before it is packaged. 

Part of our requirement for funding is to enable us make improvements on the required temperature controls needed for a quality, consistent and constant product

> Anticipated Social Impact

Not only will our product improve the health of livestock and consequently the consumer, it’ll also help our small and medium scale farmers increase their profit margin because of its affordable price and be able to improve their yield. It will also create opportunities for interested and up coming insect farmers (esp women and youth) as this will be the first of its kind to produce on a commercial scale.
