> Qualitative Results of the Innovation

1. Increased access to finance: Tala provides access to finance to over 6 million borrowers in Kenya, who may have otherwise been excluded from the traditional financial system. 
2. Improved financial literacy: Tala's app provides financial education and resources to its users, which has helped to improve financial literacy and awareness in Kenya. 
3. Reduced poverty: By providing access to finance, many of Tala's borrowers use the loans to start small businesses or to invest in education or healthcare, which can help to increase their income and improve their standard of living.
4. Increased digital financial inclusion: Tala's mobile app allows people to access loans quickly and easily using their mobile phones, which is particularly important in a country where mobile phone penetration is high, but access to traditional banking services is limited.
