> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF culture is integrated into urban development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), THEN it will lead to more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable cities, enhancing social cohesion and community participation.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Organizing a Seminar: The Centro Cultural de España in La Paz (CCELP) and UNDP hosted a seminar from November 15 to 19, 2021, to explore the connection between culture and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Participants: Cultural leaders, gender equality advocates, and urban planners participated in workshops, discussions, and panels.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Main Obstacles and Challenges:
Limited Cultural Recognition in SDGs: One challenge was the limited explicit inclusion of culture in the SDGs, making it harder to align cultural projects with global development frameworks.
Cross-Sector Collaboration: Ensuring coordination between cultural actors and urban planners was challenging due to differing priorities and methods.
Engagement Across Sectors: Involving stakeholders from various sectors and encouraging active participation required significant effort.
Advice for Colleagues:
Ensure Strong Partnerships: Foster collaboration early on with local and international partners.
Highlight Culture's Impact: Clearly demonstrate how cultural initiatives contribute to development.
Engage Stakeholders: Actively involve diverse sectors in both planning and execution to ensure wide participation.
