Economic Participation of the Bissau-Guinean Diaspora for Development of the Country
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that we want to understand 1) the Bissau-Guinean diaspora's contribution to the development of the country, 2) their relationship with the government in the country and government bodies abroad and 3) which mechanisms can be introduced to improve the contribution of the diaspora for the development of the country social, politically and economically. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Studies show that Bissau Guinean diaspora groups are active in delivering projects across a wide range of sectors, including health, education, agriculture, and the blue economy. In October 2022, the Accelerator Lab began to explore the interactions of the Bissau-Guinean diaspora via a desk review. Our findings demonstrated that there was research into the Bissau-Guinean diaspora externally and nationally. Externally, it was evident that the diaspora felt unsupported and had no trust in the Bissau-Guinean Government, so preferred to work in small groups to contribute to the development of specific villages, i.e. Filhos e Amigos de Bijimita. Internally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), General Direction of Communities (GDC) had outlined seven concrete areas of intervention through the Strategy for Diaspora Engagement in National Development with the International Organisation for Migration, as well as the Emigrant card providing customs exemptions. The Lab intends to collaborate with the MoFA and the UNDP Economic and Governance Unit to conduct a Learning Cycle to target the areas raised by the document developed by the MoFA and areas raised by the Diaspora organizations during the workshop in November 2022.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Bissau-Guinean diaspora contributes 3.1% to the GDP of the country, which has a significant impact in the socio-economic development in the country. The diaspora is a strategic resource for the development of the country and their contributions cannot be ignored. Using the Accelerator Lab methodology, to explore and test the ways in which the relationship between the state and the diaspora can be improved, so that their already large contributions can be increased for strategic development in the various sectors they're involved in. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Don't underestimate the power of the Bissau-Guinean diaspora! They're contributing 3.1% to the country's GDP and driving strategic development in various sectors. It's time to explore how we can improve our relationship with them using the Accelerator Lab methodology for even more positive impact.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What is the relationship between the diaspora and the government? In what ways the diaspora engage with the government? Where is the Bissau-Guinean Diaspora in the world? Where does the diaspora invest in Guinea-Bissau? Has the state created conditions to attract diaspora engagement?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Using Futures Analysis, we developed a Futures Thinking Workshop using the attendees of the International Diaspora Conference to discuss in what ways we can foresee a future with better engagement from the Diaspora in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This event, allowed us to also using solutions mapping techniques, in order to identify what are the areas of focus and reoccurring pain points. 

Co-creation has been a methodology using constantly throughout this cycle, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ianda Guine Djuntu and IOM, in order to develop sustainable ways of working. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through secondary data, we were able to identify what are the trends and pain points surrounding the diaspora of Guinea-Bissau before making any decisions. 

Census data (electoral census) will allow us to answer the learning question on "where is the Bissau-Guinean Diaspora?" by giving an approximation of where they might be dispersed around the world. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The overall population will benefit from this learning challenge, because if the diaspora continues to invest in the country, there will be economic growth which can lead to an increase in GDP, employment, education, health and other sectors.
