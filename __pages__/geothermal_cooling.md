Innovative

> Description of the solution

Geothermal cooling is a type of renewable energy system that moves heat from a building to below the earth's surface, using the ground like a heat sink. Systems based on geothermal energy cool in much the same way that they heat, moving hot air through a geothermal heat pump or through air-to-liquid transfer. Due to the mass of the earth below, geothermal systems can cool even intense sources of heat.

Private

> Other Notes

As a renewable resource geothermal covers a significant share of electricity demand in countries such as Iceland, El Salvador, New Zealand, Kenya and the Phillipines and meets more than 90% of heating demand in Iceland.
