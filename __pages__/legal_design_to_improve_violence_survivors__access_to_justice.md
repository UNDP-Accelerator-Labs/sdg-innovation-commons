## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Legal design to improve violence survivors’ access to justice
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Access to justice, especially for women and girls who survive violence (of all types), has been problematic for a long time. The justice system is not particularly accessible (i.e. easy to understand and navigate) and the support ecosystem (consisting of police, legal services, health services, CSOs, CBOs, etc.) is rather fragmented. Finding the right information quickly is vital following instances of violence.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Currently there is no system in place to give confidence to survivors, or those around them, that they will be treated with dignity and will be given the necessary protection and support. Women’s CSOs are very active in this field but they have limited capacity and oftentimes old infrastructure that cannot handle a high number of applications for support. As a result, most violence cases do not even get reported and survivors continue to suffer in most cases, especially women and girls who cannot remove themselves from the dangerous situation they are in.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Based on our discussions with women’s organizations, we know that the situation is getting worse day by day and official statistics support this. The pandemic-induced restrictions have increased violence cases, especially domestic violence.


</div>


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Turkey’s recent withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention is a major step backwards and will make ending VAWG (and others including LGBT+) a distant dream. Women’s organizations as well as progressive groups continue to protest the decision, but so far there is no indication of a national plan to tackle violence.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We have decided to introduce Legal Design Turkey (our delivery partner) to the CO and change the direction of one of the existing projects on legal aid (for survivors of violence). The project (belonging to the Inclusive and Democratic Governance portfolio) has followed a traditional approach in which a part of the service has been designed and delivered but without much consideration of the rest of the system. AccLab’s focus on innovation, systems thinking, and behavioural insights makes us a perfect team to change the course of this work. Unless we do it, the project’s impact will be limited. The funds for this experiment are coming from the portfolio budget (as they had spare funds to use) rather than AccLab’s.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Accelerator Lab Turkey has teamed up with Legal Design Turkey and Ministry of Justice to test new methods of engagement and information sharing to improve violence survivors’ access to justice.

Bar associations provide information and legal services to violence survivors therefore their involvement is necessary to understand and improve certain aspects of the system.

Since women's organisations provide direct support to survivors where the state fails, their perspective had to be incorporated into the design products.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Would incorporating legal design principles into an existing UNDP project (in the area of justice for VAWG) improve results in any meaningful way? Would it help encourage survivors or those around them to seek justice?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The above methods are necessary to  make sense of the existing system and experiences of women in the justice system. Design outputs must be produced collaboratively hence the reason for using co-creation and participatory design. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Although certain data exist in this area, most of it is anecdotal and official data can be misleading as it does not capture any details about survivors’ information needs. Stakeholder discussions are currently underway.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Possible ways to grow this work we will need to work with legal faculties within universities, police, women's shelters, women's NGOs, bar associations etc.
