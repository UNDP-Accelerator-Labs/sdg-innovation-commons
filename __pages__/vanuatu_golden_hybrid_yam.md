Innovator:  The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and Vanuatu Agriculture Research and Technical Centre (VARTC). 

Narrative: After 10 years of research work, the Vanuatu Golden Hybrid Yam (VGHY) was produced. It is a crossbreed of soft yam (Dioscorea Alata) and wild yam (Dioscorea Numularia) that can be harvested all year round. It is the first breeding trial that was conducted in Vanuatu and yields about 2kg and above. Twenty-three varieties of VGHY were raised in the multiplication plots in Santo in early 2021. This yam was bred to resist diseases affecting Yam and allow farmers to have access to climate-resilient varieties of root crop as well, which will benefit the population of Vanuatu in tropical disasters and also generate income for exporters.
