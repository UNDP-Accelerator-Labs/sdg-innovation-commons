Local managers of Leleuvia Island Resort enforced a ‘tabu’ which is a traditional Fijian ban in a certain marine area, where there is to be no fishing or disturbance of marine life. Cyclones, overfishing and poor waste management system left the reef in poor condition. However, 2 years after the tabu was implemented the reef and marine life began to flourish, with a permanent shark nursery now in place, which has also become a tourist attraction. ‘Tabu’ or a no-fishing zone is a traditional Fijian instrument used in many Fijian communities. They are traditional marine protected areas which have been reintroduced to Fijian waters after many decades, ‘tabus’ represent a return to traditional approaches of reefs and fisheries management. These locally managed marine protected areas empower coastal communities to take ownership of their natural resources.
