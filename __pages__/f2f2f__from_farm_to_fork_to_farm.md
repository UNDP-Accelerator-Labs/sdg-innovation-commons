## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

F2F2F: From Farm to Fork to Farm
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Strengthen healthy, fair and sustainable food systems through the articulation of public, private, academic and civil society actors as well as different technologies, emphasizing change maker youth as part of the transformation of the system.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

70% of food consumed by Peruvians comes from small family farms, but pre-COVID young members from these families have been migrating to urban centers and leaving the family business. However, due to the economic impact of COVID over two million young Peruvians are returning to their hometowns. Peruvian cuisine is gaining fans around the world but 49% of Peruvian children in rural areas and 36.7% in urban areas are anemic. How sustainable can this up-and-coming cuisine really be?

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Government data on the impact of the pandemic on the restaurant business. Government data on number of anemic population in the country. LACK of a registry on small family-based farms in the country.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab has a systemic perspective on the issue of food systems that can integrate actors that usually don’t work together, or even bring unusual actors that have not worked with UNDP before through collective intelligence methodologies. Other programmes within UNDP do not address food systems issues directly and/or address specific links within the value chain. The Lab has already built a network of young change makers at a national level, including relevant non-profit organizations and government partners, and will continue its work with them with a particular focus on food systems.  The Lab is planning on working with partners within government, international development, the private sector and academia. In particular we have agreed to work jointly with FAO on this challenge to leverage their knowledge of rural areas and use new methodologies, data sources and networks.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Do you know a young change maker that is transforming Peru’s food system into a healthy, fair and sustainable one? Do you want to become one? Join the UNDP Peru #AcceleratorLab and help us find those that are changing the country’s future one bite at a time!

Agros is a Peruvian startup that seeks to generate opportunities for family farmers to access improved financial services, competitive markets and tele-consulting. We're working with them to leverage their existing knowledge about rural farmers and the Lab's sources of international cases and alliances. https://www.agros.tech/

The PUCP has a dedicated team addressing issues related to gastronomy and currently leads the RPU. We're partnering with them and the RPU to give their students a chance to participate in our experiments and learn from the Lab's methodology (we already partnered with them for our first frontier challenge). https://www.pucp.edu.pe/formacion-continua/programa-de-gastronomia/

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will analyze different sources of qualitative data in order to understand how rural youth are working in the food and agricultural chain.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The country lacks a national farmers registry. Our experiment generates evidence for the implementation of effective systems for the registration, interaction and measurement of food systems production, and can support the strengthening rural farmers' digital skills and access.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Government agencies (Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Production) would benefit from the Lab's work and are the natural champions of the possible solutions created by young change makers and potential new data sources that support access to credit and technology for small rural farms. We are already working with both Ministries. From an academic perspective, the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) is the partner we need to ensure sustainability over time.
