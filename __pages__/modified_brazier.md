Profile Innovator Mr. Gh Nabi Khan  belongs to Baramulla district of Jammu & Kashmir. He runs a workshop named Khan Steel & Metal Works at Wagoora village. HE designs various types of items like boxes, fodder trays for animals, brazier and allied items.  Purpose Brazier locally called Bukhari in Kashmir is traditionally used as heater in Kashmir during the harsh winters in homes, offices across the valley to maintain the room temperature. It is typically a wood-burning stove. Bukhari consist of a wide cylindrical fire- chamber at the base in which wood, charcoal is burned & a narrower cylinder on the top that helps in heating the room & acts as a chimney. The base of a Kashmiri Bukhari is wider than that of the most western wood-burning stoves. During winters there is a frequent power cut in Kashmir, especially in rural areas. To overcome this problem, and to get protection from cold air the innovator thinks of this innovation. Technical details Mr. Gh Nabi  has developed a brazier having two chambers. The lower chamber has a usual fire inlet where wood or charcoal is placed for burning. A long chimney is attached to the right of a barrier to vent out smoke outside the house. In order to keep the fire burning inside the brazier an air vent is carved on the other side of the brazier. The upper chamber is an empty vessel contains water having an inlet for pouring water. As the fire is lit in the lower chamber of the brazier the water container upper side gets steamed. The innovator has specially developed the innovation for winter purposes in Kashmir. A pipe attached with a tap is attached to the water tank to have hot water. Benefits The modified brazier gives heat in the room and simultaneously it steams water during winters to have hot water. This saves energy and time to get water steamed separately. An ideal tool for rural areas having very fewer facilities available during winters. This acts as a water boiler and heater of room.
