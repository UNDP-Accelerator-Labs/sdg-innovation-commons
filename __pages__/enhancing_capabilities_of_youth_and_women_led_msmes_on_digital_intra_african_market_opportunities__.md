## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. The issue mapping exercise identified key barriers affecting trade and e-trade, with participants

prioritizing permits, licenses, regulations, access to finance, digital literacy, and access to the

internet and devices as the driving issues

2. While the One Stop Border Post (OSBP) had improved efficiency for government in both countries,

for the CBTs it had raised the cost of doing business, resulting in some CBTs using other ports of

entry, such as Livingstone or Chirundu. From an initial payment of ZMW3 on the Pontoon to

USD20 through the OSBP.

3.Local traders were severely limited in the type of goods to sell across the borders of Namibia and

Botswana, with the most affected being agricultural and forest products. Hence, traders were forced

to partner with local citizens to sell on their behalf. A few selected Zambian goods found in the

Katima Mulilo market on the Namibian side were reported to not have passed through Customs

4. The design of a programme targeting MSMEs to access regional markets through digitals platforms involves more in depth capacity building support for MSMEs to have goods that meet the export standard and MSMEs need specific training on the use of digital platforms

5. On digital market places, more explorative work is required to understand the dynamics of interoperability of existing local platforms to connect across countries.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

This is not clear yet, as the learning cycle has not begun experimentation yet.


## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Although there is existing information and data on regional trade at the macro level, we could not find data on the impact or understand the impact of RTAs on CBTs and MSMEs. Through sensemaking visits to 3 borderland areas which are trading towns we were able to understand from different perspective's of stakeholders on the understanding and use of RTAs at micro level. Further through direct interviews we were able to understand the challenges of MSMEs in trading domestically and regionally.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These innovation methods were necessary to design features of an experiment that can be tested to understand what works in promoting trade leveraging RTAS especially for female CBTs and local MSMEs
