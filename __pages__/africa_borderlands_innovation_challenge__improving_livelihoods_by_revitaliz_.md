## Title

Africa Borderlands Innovation Challenge: Improving livelihoods by revitalizing Kente weaving in Agbozume. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that high input costs, poor pricing skills, and inefficient business models in the Kente value chain have resulted in slim profits for kente weaving ventures and, by extension, low incomes for residents in Agbozume (a borderland community). Additionally, lack of quality packaging, low diversification of Kente products and limited Kente product designs all limit the market potential for Kente weavers.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Kente weaving is the primary occupation and the predominant source of livelihood for more than 70% of households in Agbozume, a borderland community in Ghana. Many residents’ livelihoods depend on the Kente trade. However, due to numerous factors, such as the high cost of yarns, activities of “middlemen” in the Kente value chain, and poor pricing abilities on the part of the weavers listed above, Kente ventures have become unprofitable over recent years. The border closures introduced by the government since the pandemic broke out have worsened the situation. The undesired effect is that most residents have struggled to keep their families afloat after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Informal traders: a balancing act of survival Informal cross border trade, by definition, requires traders to cross the border to sell their goods and services on the other side. Much of this trade takes place between border communities with strong and indestructible linkages. For instance, the Ewe language is spoken by many informal traders in both Ghana and Togo, with roots dating back to the late seventeenth century when the Ewe people originally migrated to Ghana from Togo. In the fight against the coronavirus, almost all African countries, to a differing degree, have now suspended international flights, introduced 14-day quarantine for entrants into the country, and closed land borders. As demonstrated in the map below, 44 of Africa’s 54 countries have now announced land or port closures of some form. In order to keep economies alive, cargo trade is typically still allowed by air, sea and vehicles, under very strict conditions.

We are suffering – Residents of Aflao protest continuous border closure Some aggrieved residents of Aflao thronged major streets in the Volta Region to protest the continuous closure of the border between Ghana and Togo. The demonstrators who were clad in red and black attire were seen holding placards with inscriptions such as “Mie Fu Kpem” meaning “we are suffering”, as they chanted war songs on Friday, August 27.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Through an extensive co-creation and solution design process involving various community stakeholders, including the Kente weavers, development queen-mother, business leaders, and the Ghana Enterprises Agency, the Lab is helping to put innovative thinking and profitability back into the kente trade. Given our expertise in a broad range of innovative tools and techniques, the Accelerator Labs are well-placed to support the artisans and traders through capacity-building and business-enhancing interventions and to co-create solutions that help local enterprises and improve livelihoods in border communities along the Ghana-Togo corridor. Investing resources into solving this multifaceted challenge will have a ripple effect on businesses and livelihoods in the community.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the main determinants of income and livelihoods for residents of Agbozume, Aflao and surrounding communities? Who in the communities is most affected by the declining business outcomes in the predominant value chains? What are the main levers of profitability in the kente value chain? Where do we need to focus our attention?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

After extensive ethnographic research - interactions, observations, walk-throughs - and analysis of the predominant economic activities in the border communities, the Lab identified the top three value chains in the border communities of Aflao: the Kente value chain, cassava processing and coconut processing.  In April 2022, the UNDP Ghana and Togo Accelerator Labs jointly conducted a baseline survey to identify critical constraints to the Kente value chain and areas of interventions required for the Kente weavers. Applying design thinking, we are co-designing and testing interventions to improve business outcomes for the weavers and traders.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

 The new data sources are enabling us to gain a granular and deeper understanding of the challenges faced by borderland communities. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Ghana Enterprises Agency, which has the mandate for supporting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), has been an active partner in our work. The Member of Parliament for Ketu South (which covers the Aflao border and neighbouring communities), who also doubles as the Development Queenmother of Ketu South, is a strong influencer within the community and has been a great champion of our initiative. The Municipal Chief Executive and other local government officials are keenly interested in our work and will benefit from the insights this innovation experiment will yield.
