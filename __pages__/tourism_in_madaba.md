## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Nightlife options in Madaba city are limited, presenting an opportunity for improvement as suggested by various stakeholders.
The online presence for activities in Madaba could be more robust. For example, a few posts on Jordan Tourism Board's Instagram page about Madaba exist.
Raising the local population's awareness will improve belonging to the cities and historical sites, positively impacting engagement with activities. School education is one element to consider to tackle this aspect.
Most of the solutions were founded by women and/or youth, indicating that they may be more active than others in this domain.
There are several informal businesses or initiatives in the tourism domain, signifying the value of the informal economy and an opportunity to support informal businesses.
Creativity in designing products and experiences in Jordan is immature. Tourism products and experiences throughout Jordan do not "wow" visitors or go above and beyond to impress. They often resort to duplication, kitsch, and average or below-average quality.&nbsp;

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

We were lucky that the various stakeholders received the project with open arms. The project was endorsed by the senior management at the country office and a couple of government officials, encouraging others to interact and cooperate with us. Most of the challenges were logistical.&nbsp;

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We focused on qualitative data resources as most of the discussions on tourism were based on the number of tourists. We wanted to gauge the actual experience of tourists and the preferences that govern their decision-making. During our meetings with officials, they wondered what the tourists wanted and had several speculations. For example, the personas method and the experiment with the Arab colleagues helped us capture what kind of experiences they are looking for and what was missing from the available ones in Madaba.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The AI tool allowed us to collect and analyse 70K+ comments about tourism in Jordan. The tool and the results were novel for the officials and colleagues in the country office. It gave access to existing data that otherwise would have been impossible to gather and use.&nbsp;
Mapping creative local solutions is a way to build a case for working with grassroots groups, supporting existing efforts rather than bringing in new programs, and advocating for UNDP to look beyond the usual suspects.
Lastly, running quick experiments enabled us to work with youth to test their ideas on a small scale and in cost-efficient ways, which otherwise would not have been an option for UNDP or the youth.&nbsp;

## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Shababuna Ezweih a non-profict youth led organisation. Together, we designed and installed an open air exhibition on intangible heritage in Madaba city. The experiment is to test how we could improve the tourist night activities through engaging in a self-guided tour around the city.

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We did not work with them directly, but they were stakeholders in several activities we managed.&nbsp;

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Majdi Al Yacoub - a member of the Jordanian Parliament who initiated contact with UNDP, supported our efforts during the project and connected us with decisions making and other influencers in the tourism sector in Jordan.&nbsp;
Madaba Tourism Directorate - we worked on identifying opportunities for tourism in Madaba, and they supported us by facilitating access to information and people; they participated in workshops and interviews and dedicated a space in the visitor centre to host one of the open-air exhibition elements.
Municipality of Greater Madaba - collaborating in identifying opportunities for tourism in Madaba, they participated in workshops and allowed us to install an open-air exhibition in the streets of Madaba and supply them with electricity.&nbsp;


> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?
