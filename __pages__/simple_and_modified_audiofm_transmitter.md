> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is based on improving the communication in terms of radio transmission in the country especially rural areas where there is no electricity to power up the current radio transmitters on the market, this is becouse my innovation only uses 24V of electricity which is also intended to be reduced to about 12V unlike the one on the market which uses more than 230V.
Secondly my transmitter is portable and deos not require a lot of space when mounting and most importantly the materials used are mostly scrap materials from damaged electronic devices. And the manufacturing of this is very cheap about 80% less from the cost of the transmitter on the market.
This transmitter will be used to transmit radio signals from the set up station to the receivers in this case the receiver should be a radio or any device that supports radio frequencies.
The transmission rage is adjustable to about 50 Km radious.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income becouse the transmitters will be sold country wide an outside Zambia becouse they will be cheaper than the transmitters on the market.
This innovation will improve the communication sector both in rural and urban areas. The challenge prize will help manufacturer the actual innovation and will bell advertise the product and put it into working. The project will bring income and will provide employment for the local people and will also bring foreign income for the country

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is made with local materials. The prototype that is carently there is only transmitting In a range of about 100m but it is initially designed to transmit about 20Km radius. The prototype worked 100% effective

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will make communication easy effective and efficient in Zambia and the world at large becouse of its reliability and cheap materials used and will provide employment to the local people becouse there will be manufacturing part and the operation part when transmitting.
