Mapping the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Syria 


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Lack of a common and clear understanding of the entrepreneurial context and ecosystem in Syria 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



  

The conflict has resulted in significant economic challenges, including

infrastructure damage, displacement of people, and a general decline in

business activity. all of which has severely disrupted the entrepreneurial

ecosystem in Syria. Many entrepreneurs and professionals have left the country,

seeking stability and opportunities elsewhere.

Despite these challenges, there have been some instances of resilience and entrepreneurial

activity amidst the conflict. Local entrepreneurs and startups have emerged in

sectors like information technology, e-commerce, services, shared economy, and

social enterprises, often operating under difficult circumstances. These

individuals and organizations have showcased creativity, resourcefulness, and

adaptability in pursuing their business ideas. 

Several local and international organizations, including UN agencies and UNDP, have

also been working to support entrepreneurship in Syria. They provide funding,

mentorship, training programs, and networking opportunities to help

entrepreneurs overcome challenges and develop their businesses. Such

organizations aim to empower Syrian entrepreneurs to contribute to economic

recovery and job creation. 

The entrepreneurial ecosystem in Syria is significantly impacted by the ongoing

conflict, and the operating environment remains complex and challenging.

Rebuilding and catalyzing the ecosystem will require dedicated efforts from

various stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and

international organizations. 

To begin the process, it is crucial to understand the current state of

entrepreneurship in Syria and map the existing ecosystem. This analysis

involves examining the stakeholders, their interactions, identifying enablers,

and understanding the challenges and opportunities present. In pursuit of this

goal, the Accelerator Lab Syria, in partnership with Sanad, a Syrian civil

society organization, will conduct a series of collective intelligence sessions

with different stakeholders, including actors and entrepreneurs. The objective

of these sessions is to map the ecosystem comprehensively and derive meaningful

recommendations for its enhancement and development.
