> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia is ranked among the most favorable countries to advance agriculture and build food secure communities coupled with high employment turnover and revenue collected potentially. The past few years have seen young Zambians eager to invest their money into legit ventures that will yield above 10% return on investment. Consequently, a lot of individuals have been swindled by too good to be true schemes. ZEDFARMINVEST offers several enterprises and farms into which people can invest by buying shares for a specified period in the agricultural sector and obtain a return on investment of up to 20-30%. The business model makes use of qualified labor to manage the farm(s)/ enterprises, assured high value markets. Additionally, investors get real time access to production and financial components of the project.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation seeks to bridge the gap between farmers and access to finance, which acts as a hindrance to grow the farming business. Through shares purchased (crowd funding), we intend to finance vetted farms and increase production. This will consequently lead to higher incomes for farmers and high employment rates. Sectors of interest includes the Horticultural crops and livestock.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently we have a 1 hectare prototype, growing cabbages and tomatoes with 10 investors. The project is worth about K400,000, consisting of a sustainable led irrigation system, farm housing and sitting on 100 hectares of land. So far we've made 40% profit from sales.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The community in Central province, Chisamba has high unemployment levels, high pupil dropout and early marriages. The youths in the area are involved in illegal gold mining. This project will provide alternative source of income for the community.
