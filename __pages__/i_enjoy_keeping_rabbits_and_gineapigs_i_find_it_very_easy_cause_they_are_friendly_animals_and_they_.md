> Title of the innovation

I enjoy keeping rabbits and gineapigs,I find it very easy cause they are friendly animals and they simple to keep.

> Brief description of the innovation

My all idea about this innovation is to make it a commercial farming so that I can elevate poverty levels in our country.and also open up a rabbit farming center for other females to learn.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My main aim is to make them grow in numbers so that I can open up a company like zambeef knowing that rabbit meat is rear in Zambia and not everyone sells rabbit meat. In that I can be able to employe a lot of people and since it's a rear product am sure it can be profitable and my main targets are big companies like ShopRite, pick n pay,choppies and also open my own returant which will cutter only for traditional food  menu  which will also include rabbit meat.

> Technical Feasibility

As of now I have managed to build a 3×2 poultry and have put a wire fence for protection and I staffed saw dust in tires for where the mothers give birth and I monitor them from time to time .they have a eating timetable knowing that they eat tirelessly so there eating time is like, in the morning and evenings only .my plan is to grow them in numbers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will provide a rearly product which is rabbit meat and am sure it will be good for the market cause as of now beef  is expensive and not everyone is managing to afford it
