## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Portfolio of Impacts: We have learnt that focusing on a solution that addresses multiple development challenges and contributes to multiple SDGs allows for the creation of a ‘portfolio of impacts’. By focusing on food waste, we had an impact on: ·       The resources that go into the production of food that are then wasted, such as water and energy (SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production); ·       Increasing the available amount of food in the system (SDG 2: Zero hunger); ·       Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions produced from food that goes to landfill (SDG 13: Climate action). With the interventions we designed, we contributed to: ·       Scaling food waste innovations (SDG 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure); ·       Supporting the creation of new enterprises in the sector (SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth, and SDG 1: No poverty); ·       Behaviour change at household level (SDG 12: Sustainable consumption and production); ·       Bringing together a diverse range of actors in the food waste ecosystem (SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals) ·       Demonstrating circularity and providing solutions that bring food waste back into the system as value (SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities); ·       Supporting the development of products that convert food waste to valuable products that increase sustainability, such as fertilizers, alternative livestock feeds, biogas etc. (SDG 15: Life on land, and SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy).   Portfolio of Partners: We designed this project with multiple interventions in the system, and partnered with six organisations representing different sectors, including academia, government, civil society, private sector, and international organisations. This allowed the project to be informed by a diversity of insights, frames of reference, and network connections. By navigating different mandates and approaches to bring partners together in a common purpose, it created an implementation modality with a whole-of-society framing. We additionally developed relationships with a wide range of stakeholders in the ecosystem – these were not formalised as partnerships, but these actors were included in project steering committees and provided additional insights, links to networks, information on ongoing activities in the thematic area, and led to independent collaborations outside of the project activities and scope.   Portfolio of Interventions: We designed this project with multiple interventions which allowed us to nudge the system at different leverage points (and where hopefully these ‘small’ shifts will lead to greater change). These interventions included: Identifying and scaling existing innovations; Supporting capacitation and enterprise development of grassroots entrepreneurs; Research mapping food waste and providing evidence for the development of local government frameworks; Training in circular economy and food waste provided at the local level, including government practitioners, SMMEs, and actors within the food system; Research and Development with university students for food waste product development (biogas extraction and composting models); Behaviour change campaign focused on households responsible for the most food waste.   Action (*Experimentation) over Research: Though of course research is necessary for informed approaches and evidence-based decision making, we saw far more impact in the areas of the project that focused on taking action (with or without all the ‘necessary’ information). This was particularly evident in the support to enterprise development and scaling – the innovations were piloted, went through various iterations, piloted again, validated, and then scaled – without having a full picture on the sector, market, industry etc. to inform this. By starting with the solution, we almost didn’t need to know what markets existed, where there were opportunities in the value chain, what behaviour change would be required etc.   Demand for the solutions has grown organically through the increased exposure and availability of the solutions themselves.   Intervention Sustainability: We created platforms for our partners to work together throughout the project, and actively created space for the identification of synergies across activities, which allowed them to leverage off and enhance each other’s project work streams. This has led to a stand-alone Community of Practice which has been taken up and hosted by an external stakeholder and will convene quarterly workshops to continue the work in this area beyond the project closure. Regarding our work with innovators, we ensured that the partners we chose to implement the activities were committed to a longer-term engagement with the entrepreneurs and would continue to support them beyond the project closure. For example, the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship designed a 1000 day capacity development programme (where our project was only one year), and will continue to support entrepreneurs in investor readiness, links to networks, access to market, and raising investment. These approaches have ensured that the project activities were catalytic, leading to emergent outcomes and greater sustainability of the designed project outcomes.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Using delivery as a key measure of success skews the incentives in the system away from impact. Setting up the various portfolios above requires time for exploration, design and relationship development, and pressure to demonstrate spend / liquidation from quarter one can lead to decisions that ultimately decrease the potential impact of projects. For this project we applied for RBA Trac2 funds and were granted $700 000. With funding guaranteed for only one year, it creates a barrier to leveraging off the results that have been achieved. We mitigated this to some extent with partners who could continue to support the selected innovators, but more could be done to build on the research, product development, training, and behaviour change work streams for which we now need to mobilise additional resources (which could lead to reduced momentum, traction and uptake). We significantly exceeded all of our targets on this project, except for one work stream which included in-person training workshops. We chose to use an in-person modality instead of virtual as we felt this would make it more accessible for local participants where we were providing the training, as well as lead to increased engagement, network creation, and emergent discussions. However, with the shift to a more virtual world after the pandemic impacted our target numbers. We were oversubscribed for every training, but on the day many people did not show up.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We conducted research on food waste flows in three districts to develop a report for local government. This required extensive qualitative interviews and the use of proxy indicators as there was very little existing data at the sub-national level. We also conducted R&D to identify the best methods for methane extraction from food waste to use in biogas digesters, as well as the best methods to create bokashi compost.   We used ecosystem mapping to design the project interventions, identify possible partners, and identify actors in the thematic area.  The innovator support programmes had a strong focus on mentorship.  The behaviour change campaign was designed using behaviour insights. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The national Innovation Challenge allowed us to surface over 100 SMMEs and innovators working in the food waste space; The Exposure Workshops assisted in drawing in grassroots innovators from rural areas, and identifying potential ideas / innovations for enterprise development; Portfolio Approaches were key to this project, and the benefits of using these is captured in the lessons learned section; We used Systems Thinking to map the ecosystem and to design a portfolio of interventions at multiple points in the system; We used a Behaviour Change campaign to target LSM 7 – 10 as the sector in society responsible for the most food waste at the household level; Existing enterprises and grassroots innovators were supported through Proof of Concept processes in the capacitation programmes we provided to scale.  The project drew on inputs from multiple stakeholder during design through a process of Co-Creation.

The focal point for Circular Economy at the Department of Science and Innovation additionally sat on our steering committee, and provided input to project activities and outputs. OR Tambo, eThekwini and Waterburg Districts – we engaged with these partners throughout the project as these were the geographic locations of most of our activities. They were included in project steering committee meetings, workshops, as well as assisting in identifying stakeholders for interviews and commenting on research outputs.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By supporting innovators at different stages of development and providing an online platform to connect them, we created a community of actors in this thematic area who could learn from and support each other through the process. We saw: more experienced entrepreneurs assisting those who were moving from ideation to enterprise development; sharing of models for successful solutions; the application of these successful models at the local / community level; people linking into each other’s networks for increased learning and exposure; the development of relationships that could enhance the sustainability of the project outcomes.   There was very little existing data available on food waste in two of the less developed geographic areas where we implemented. We thus used proxy indicators / alternative sources such as: Maps of grassland coverage; Agricultural census data; Mapping processing, storage, wholesale and distribution facilities; interviewing local produce markets and landfill sites etc. This can now provide a model for other rural districts to develop food waste maps.   As above, we partnered with 6 organisations representing different sectors, including academia, government, civil society, private sector, and international organisations. This allowed the project to be informed by a diversity of insights, frames of reference, and network connections. By navigating different mandates and approaches to bring partners together in a common purpose, it created an implementation modality with a whole-of-society framing. By including additional actors in the ecosystem in the project discussions and reporting, we also drew on a more diverse ‘collective’ intelligence.
