> Type of the Solution

Technology

> Affected Sector

Waste Management, Renewable Energy

> Description of the solution

Solution for solid-state batch anaerobic digestion for organic waste, turning it into renewable energy and compost. This collaboration, pioneering in Brazil, embodies a Nature-based Solution (NbS) and Circular Economy, aiming for significant CO2 reduction by diverting waste from landfills. The project supports urban agriculture and reforestation, enhancing soil, fostering biodiversity, and improving food security, aligning with Rio's Climate Action Plan to reduce GHG emissions and advance zero-waste governance.
