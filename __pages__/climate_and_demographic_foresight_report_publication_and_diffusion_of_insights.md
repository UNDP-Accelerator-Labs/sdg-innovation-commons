## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

- Foresight can be done with breadth (geographical and type) of stakeholders to provide more complete scenarios or future implications

- It will take extra effort to mainstream foresight by talking to marginalized groups like indigenous people, but efforts in validating using national language and come down to their settlement have grounded the findings of the foresight report

- Due to huge volume of input from stakeholders, and amount of policies to be stress-tested the length of the report tripled - prompting dilemma of choosing which information to be included or excluded

- Doing joint-publication due to lack of capacity in the CO pose risks of delayed publication. CO should seriously consider increasing the technical expertise of own staff to carry similar projects in the future. Although there are huge merits partnering with local organizations, such as the ease of doing logistics, some progress were beyond UNDP's control

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The media interest and buzz generated around the foresight report surpassed our expectation. The news coverage of foresight report garnered 1.38 million view counts for 21 mainstream news coverage, amplifying UNDP’s call for urgent and system approach for climate and demographic transition.

Thus an advocacy plan needed to sustain the momentum of the report and increase take-up of the recommendations of the report

## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Using MIRO to codify trends and weak signals towards forming key drivers of change

Deep community engagement to introduce foresight concepts in laymen terms and to nudge them to think about their future aspirations
