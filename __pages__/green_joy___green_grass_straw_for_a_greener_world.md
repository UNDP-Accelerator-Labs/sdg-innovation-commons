Plastic Pollution Challenge: The demand for straws in Ha Long is growing strongly, following the boom of the tourism industry. Quang Ninh province received more than 14 million visitors in 2019, 14% more than 2018. Among 8 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year, straws comprise just 0.025 percent, but significantly impacts ocean and water fauna, leading to the deaths  of millions of seabirds, hundreds of thousands of sea animals and countless fish each year.

Innovation: Green Joy is replacing plastic straws with environmentally friendly, natural straws made of Lepironia grass, which is abundant only in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam. The production process is eco-friendly, with 90% of the process being automated and relying on solar energy,  reducing electricity and water consumption and resulting in minimal carbon emissions. They are also piloting AI technologies in the sorting process to automate the production line.

Business Model: Selling to B2B HoReCa customers domestically (D2C) and wholesaler/distributors for export to Europe, America, Japan, South Korean and APAC Revenue split: 90% wholesale, 10% retail.

Market: The market demand for grass straws is growing exponentially, as single-use plastic ones are gradually banned in Europe, the US, Asia, in 2020 -2021. In the US alone, about 500 million straws are used every single day,  and according to Statista.com, Eunomia. Straw Wars, 23.5 billion plastic straws were used in Europe as of March 2018.  With this, they calculate that the total addressable market for grass straws is about USD 2.5 billion, in which the Service Available Market and Serviceable Obtainable Market is around USD 1 billion and USD 50 million, respectively. This market potential is about 30 times larger than our current manufacturing capabilities, about 36 million straws per year  To meet such high market demand, they plan to optimize our production by gradually automating more steps of the production process.
