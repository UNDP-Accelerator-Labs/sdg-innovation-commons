1.       The accelerator lab Bangladesh focused on community-based tourism as a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment through employment generation. UNDP Bangladesh has previously focused on conservation of endangered species in the Sundarbans, a key challenge to which is unsustainable tourism. To ensure the biodiversity conservation and promote responsible tourism in the Sundarbans, the lab identified ecotourism as a potential solution. One of the grassroots organizations working in this space that the lab identified is the local environmental organization Bangladesh Environment and Development Society (BEDS) in Khulna, which is implementing an innovative community-based tourism initiative for promoting sustainable livelihoods and conservation of the Sundarbans. BEDS’ ecotourism site focuses on community-based tourism carried out by the locals. The community maintains organic farms and uses them to feed visitors traditional meals of crab, shrimp, and fish. Performance troupes offer song and dance and local shops offer visitors their pick of handmade wall hangings, embroidered cushion covers and other local crafted items. The purchases also help to support the local economy, reducing the communities’ over-reliance on the forest’s resources. To further reduce dependence on the Sundarbans’ resources, BEDS conducted skill development training, selecting women from 100 families and training them handicrafts based on the biodiversity of the Sundarbans (tablecloths, bed sheets, pillow covers, handbags, key rings, handkerchiefs, vanity bags, etc.) which they can sell to tourists. BEDS has developed its own brand Banojibi agro farms, under which various food items such as rice, oil and pickle are being produced by the locals. BEDS has also undertaken nature education for the forest dwellers by creating interactive and engaging communication products such as board games showing different parts of Sundarbans and biodiversity maps showing flora and fauna. These materials can also be used to educate tourists and promote ecotourism.
