Innovator: Fiberglass Vanuatu

Fibreglass Vanuatu in partnership with RME Electrical is now supplying a ‘plug and play’ fully integrated off-grid solar fibreglass refrigeration system made designed, manufactured and fitted with high-quality Australian made equipment. Managing Director of Fibreglass Vanuatu Mr Geordie Mackenzie stated “Our Fibre Ice off-grid solar refrigeration systems are able to withstand a harsh environment which is representative of life in our rural areas. We understand the needs of our rural people and have worked with RME Electrical to develop a product to meet these needs. The freezers are made of long-lasting non-corrosive fibreglass material and high-quality parts. Continual testing shows Fibre Ice systems are able to hold -25 degrees and maintain -18 degrees for extended periods of time as per International Food Standards. This is excellent performance considering the likely delay in arranging repairs in remote locations”.
