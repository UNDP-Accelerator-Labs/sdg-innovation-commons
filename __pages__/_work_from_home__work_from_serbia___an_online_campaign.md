Returning Point WFH campaign - “Work from Home, Work from Serbia”, an online campaign as a reaction to the general movement of remote work, with companies deciding to fully integrate working from home as the new normal in the face of the global COVID 19 pandemic. With a large Serbian diaspora working in Europe and in the USA that now has the ability to work fully remotely, our intention is to try to promote Serbia a hub for location independent digital workers from the diaspora.
