> Title of the innovation

Fish farming can supplement the citrus business through the provision of nutrient waters being put in the nursery and fed to the grown trees.

> Brief description of the innovation

The ponds are stocked with fish and surrounding areas have a fruit Nursey where upon various fruits are being grown from Nursey to the orchard. Waters from the ponds is fed to the nursery plants and the trees in the orchard.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The fish is sold at k50 per kg and the nursery plants are sold at not less than k20 un grafted and over k80 once grafted
The vegetables also are sold and consumed

> Technical Feasibility

The ponds will remain  to be placed around the farm near the citrus trees that provide shade to the nursery Plants. Whilst the ponds shall provide irrigation waters to the nursery trees and orchard.
This I have started to do and has worked very well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Very good set up that is cost effective as waters from pond save lots of expenditure on electricity. And fertilisers. The waters from the pond are highly fertile.
