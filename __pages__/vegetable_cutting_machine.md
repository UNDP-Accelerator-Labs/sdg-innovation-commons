> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is designed to cut leaf vegetables

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income by selling the innovation/machines and packing the vegetables after cutting them to markerteers, restaurant, school and shopping malls. The prize will help the business grow by producing more machines that will be sold and opening outlets were the machines will be stationed for cutting when selling package commodity to communities.

> Technical Feasibility

The machine is designed to cut fresh vegetables with a spiral cutting blade,the machine is a working prototype.
I want to perfect the working machanism and material selection.

> Anticipated Social Impact

When the machine is fully operational,I will creat outlets where workers will be employed,since the current methods people use hands which can transmit diseases when one is cut by using a knife. The innovation is designed not to involve directly contact with the Cutting blade therefore reducing the spread of diseases.
