Climate Change Challenge Action Plan-UNDP-AccLab in Iraq
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Iraqi’s individual behaviours rarely take into consideration climate change. Individual behaviour of personnel in public institutions, private institutions and on community level does not take serious actions regarding the environment. In return, this reflects negatively on the environment and the sustainability of current projects or ideas are being implemented in Iraq. Adding to this, the environmental ecosystem efforts are not well communicated to effectively advocate for climate actions and the efforts are not well coordinated to lead for long-term impact on climate action in Iraq.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Iraq is one of the countries where climate change is most evident, it is affecting Iraq’s economy, environment, and society. Historically many aspects resulted in negatively affecting Iraqi’s environment from the continuous conflicts and wars, air pollution, the high rate of population growth, threat of water shortage, and poor water quality (World Bank, 2017). Building on this, The sensing and exploring of 2020 regarding why Climate action in Iraq is not put forward by Iraqi community revealed that there are some fundamental reasons for this. First, the environment ecosystem is not well-connected to work coherently and join efforts to tackle climate change in Iraq. Second, the sensing and exploring revealed that&nbsp; individual behaviours rarely take into consideration the environment hence leading to damaging the environment unintentionally.&nbsp; There are many drivers, and on different levels,&nbsp; that are leading to the insights acquired from the sensing and exploring in 2020:&nbsp; 1- Education System: It all starts from education, the education system in schools in Iraq suffers from weak curricula and practical applications on environmental aspects and the importance of the human role in protecting the environment and climate. As we know that the current teaching method in the schools depends greatly on Spoon Feeding, the student cannot well understand the importance of his role in protecting the surrounding environment and the impact of his daily behaviors on environmental pollution and damage. As for higher and academic education, there are many departments and colleges that specialize in the environmental aspect, whether in science, engineering or education, and they graduate a good number of students at the bachelor’s or postgraduate level. But their efforts are based on the scientific, theoretical and research side, not practical and real experiments, the problems are discussed or studied&nbsp; in the universities that may not be related to the real need for the Iraqi market and environment issues. This is due to the weakness of the laboratories' ability to experiment and measure, to the lack of communication with the private sector and the Ministry of Health and Environment, to the lack of a sense of the importance of academic role in changing the people behaviors in the community &nbsp; at the environmental level, and Also, there is a lack in innovation and creativity&nbsp; in the projects are proposed or presented from the students and professors. On another side, there is a lack of initiatives, voluntary work,&nbsp; and activities inside the schools and universities that could encourage people to&nbsp; be aware about&nbsp; their roles to protect the environment, and how these colleges play an important role to make simple interventions for effective change in the behavior’s people in their communities.&nbsp; Most initiatives are focusing on planting trees in the university gardens, but without shedding light on how the students and teachers can sustain or take care of them. Also, many colleges have taken advantage of green spaces in universities in order to build additional classes or laboratories due to the urgent need and the increasing number of students and professors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2- In Iraq there is a lack of Sustainable local products and services: The behaviors of individuals in their daily lives have a positive impact on the environment when environmentally sustainable products are available in the market in a wide range&nbsp; and in reasonable price with the economic income of the Iraqi individual, and the imported industrial products compete in a way that encourages individuals to use environmental bags for example, recycled materials, reduce Plastic, sustainable clothing and many more. And because the Iraqi market suffers from a great weakness in the local product in general, and the environmentally sustainable local product in particular, the behavior of individuals will tend to be indifferent to what has a negative impact on the environment depending on what is available in the market. On the other side, most services that are provided to the iraqi people encourage their behaviors to be unsustainable. For example, there is a lack of using the bikes instead of cars because of unpaved streets or lack of bike pathways in the cities.&nbsp; 3- Here, we will share the results of our sensing and exploring about the Government and environmental ecosystem&nbsp; Efforts:&nbsp; First, there are many efforts exerted in the Iraqi government to face environmental challenges, although there is no ministry specifically concerned with the environment, but it is integrated with the Ministry of Health, and most of these projects are at the level of policies and strategies, with some projects interested in renewable energy and others. But the Iraqi individual is not aware enough of these current projects and the government's efforts, in addition to the absence of an administrative plan and a sustainable comprehensive system in which individuals and citizens participate in the sustainability of the project after its implementation. Consequently, this resulted in the citizens not feeling responsible for changing their negative behaviors that negatively affect the environment and decrease&nbsp; the sustainability of these projects and&nbsp; whole systems currently implemented. For example, waste separation, water or energy rationalization, water contamination, air pollution,&nbsp; green ِareas spaces or investing the brownfield areas. Second, International and local organizations in environmental projects make great efforts, whether at the level of financial, strategic or innovation support and also, awareness campaigns. But the whole environmental ecosystem efforts are not well communicated to effectively advocate for climate actions and the efforts are not well coordinated to lead for long-term impact on climate action in Iraq.&nbsp; 4- Private Sector and innovation in Environmental aspects On the private sector level, the weak private sector and banking sector discourages investors from investing in the environment sector.&nbsp; Also, there are almost no successful environment projects that succeeded, and this lack of success stories discourages risk-takes from investing in this sector.&nbsp; 5- Last but not least, the Community Awareness might be the main driver behind the challenge identified above: here is a lack of community awareness about the importance of their role in protecting the environment, and the impact of their daily positive and negative behaviors on water, energy, soil, climate and others. This is due to several reasons, including what was discussed in the previous reasons. Therefore, below, we will highlight here the role of the media and the current voluntary awareness campaigns. First, there is a lack of using innovative methods in the media in general&nbsp; about the environment and climate, and a weakness in television programs, social media campaigns&nbsp; that shed light on the environment in Iraq in general. The lack of documentaries or artistic works that could have a major role in changing people's behavior to take into account the environmental aspects. For example&nbsp; If we google or&nbsp; Brows on the official pages of Iraqi&nbsp; MoHE or MoC or any other organizations and institutions are related&nbsp; to the environment or climate issues, we will find most of the posts, photos, videos focusing on the agreement or activities without innovative way of promoting or using the visualization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, recently, many volunteer groups and groups have appeared on tree planting or water pollution, among others. These groups suffer from a lack of coordination with each other to unify their efforts, and they suffer from the support of the academic and governmental sector in terms of planning and investing in open spaces. Although these groups focus heavily on the role of individuals and their behaviors in protecting the environment, most of them rely on media promotion more than activities on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to tackle the above drivers, there are different stakeholders involved in tackling climate change. The Iraqi government is represented by the Ministry of Health and Environment, Ministry of Water Resources and research centers at public universities. Also international organizations and embassies in Iraq are actively promoting climate action. Local organizations are joining the movement, yet the lack of public awareness is hugely limiting their work. Adding to that, private actor companies are also doing some efforts to tackle this challenge.&nbsp; As a result of the drivers, the status-quo does not look very promising. To start describing the current situation in Iraq in regard to climate change, it is worth mentioning that we don’t have a stand alone ministry to deal with the environmental issues. The Ministry of Environment was merged with the Ministry of Health in order to act as one ministry called the Ministry of Health and Environment. The focus mainly on the health sector from this ministry and the environment sector is getting less focus. If we can dive more to the efforts of other stakeholders around Iraq, we can see that just now they started to take environmental issues into consideration with scattered events. It is noted that most of these events are requested based on the donors requirements not based on the actual need in the community. Most of these events are targeting the entrepreneurs to come up with innovative ideas to tackle the climate issues, while most of these ideas stack in the ideation phase since the infrastructure of the country is not prepared yet to equip such ideas to move to the implementation phase. This is because the bad climate actions among the locals became habits more than behaviours that we may change. The generations keep transferring the negative actions in the field of environment to the new generations. Another type of intervention from the international organization to support the ministry to be more adaptive to the climate issues is by building the capacities of the ministry itself. It is a good movement from the INGOs but this took a lot of time and effort and they started to forget to engage the locals with the process of building their awareness and capacity towards the environment. On the other hand, if we talk about the ecosystem related to the environment and climate change then we can see it is in the very beginning stages, not connected, the activities are not communicated and the locals are astonished by these activities that they are not used to. The negative results of climate change can be seen in all aspects of life in Iraq. The lack of sufficient actions to tackle climate change are worsening the issue and mainly leading to increased heat, pollution, and desertification in Iraq.&nbsp; Starting from the increasing temperatures. Summer in Iraq is usually hot and dry, research and personal experience show in the last few years has been hotter. The heat is affecting people’s lives, causing some fires in the city, and also affecting businesses. Adding to this, pollution, especially water pollution is increasing in Iraq and recently many local organizations have been pointing out this issue. Most importantly, the shrinkage of the green areas in Iraq and the decreased focus on agriculture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will focus on sensing and exploring the behaviour of the Iraqi individual in respect to climate change, and how we can induce local level effect to encourage local organizations to lead change in this domain, encourage Iraqi individuals to be more responsible towards the environment, and support entrepreneurs in ideating and implementing local solutions to tackle this challenge. Mainly:&nbsp; The Accelerator Lab focuses on the local community prioritized challenges in regard to climate change and communicates these priorities to policy makers. The AccLab is using innovative and localized ways to sense and explore the reasons for lack of ideas for climate considerate projects .&nbsp; The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use unusual sources of data in order to understand the nature of climate change in Iraq, specifically will focus on local data to measure both the positive and negative impacts of climate change.&nbsp; The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use innovative methodologies to spark thinking about climate change with the stakeholders. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will work on embedding innovative methodologies like future thinking within the local community and local organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The UNDP- AccLab in Iraq will focus on scanning the environment ecosystem in Iraq in order to identify the active stakeholders, and identify their direction and existing resources. This is all done in the aim of sharing lessons learned, insights, information, and experiences on an ongoing basis, while investing in the local resources available between them. Such scanning and mapping&nbsp; will enhance the connectivity in the environmental ecosystem in Iraq and embed that in the UNDP.&nbsp;&nbsp; The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq is focusing on understanding people behaviors towards environmental potential solutions&nbsp; through on mapping and experimenting&nbsp; innovative local solutions for&nbsp; studying&nbsp; barriers, attitudes and behaviors and determining whether these solutions are useful or not, with the community to move to the scaling stage or changing the policies. The Lab will use a portfolio approach to tackle the mentioned challenge and encouraging the bottom-up approach is one of the main activities of the lab since these local solutions are coming from the heart of the problem by the locals who lived it day in and day out.&nbsp; Learning is the main part of the work cycle of the accelerator lab where the lab is capable of scaling the indigenous knowledge and the lab’s insights into a systemic change within a small period of time. Precisely, the lab will depend on the base, network and the knowledge gained from the first climate exhibition in Iraq implemented in 2020 through utilizing the future thinking and art with the locals to imagine the future of climate in Iraq.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the innovative tools we can use to positively change institutional and individual behaviours toward climate change in Iraq?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ideation with AI &amp; ML: The UNDP Accelerator Lab will utilize this method to engage the locals in order to identify the innovative solutions with using AI and ML that we can use to positively change institutional and individual behaviours toward climate change in Iraq. This method will show us another type of intervention (a mirror to reflect the local perspectives) and increase our options in order to sense, explore, and test different points of view from locals who are living the challenge day in and day out. Also, the innovation mission will increase our network and build a good awareness of the climate issues in Iraq. Future Analysis: the aim of using future analysis in answering the learning question “What are the innovative tools we can use to positively change institutional and individual behaviours toward climate change in Iraq?” is to map the signals that are happening now and are affecting people’s behaviour towards the environment.&nbsp; Systems-Mapping: the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will start mapping the ecosystem of climate action supporters in Iraq with the aim of answering the learning question “What are the innovative tools we can use to positively change institutional and individual behaviours toward climate change in Iraq?” in order to map the partners working on behavioral changes and sense and explore possibilities of aligning efforts.&nbsp; Social Media Analysis and Data Visualization: The UNDP AccLab in Iraq will work with a Local organization (River Tigris Protectors Association) to identify the innovative methods and tools that could be used to induce positive behavioral influence, namely the ways used to motivate the community to increase their knowledge and sense of responsibility when it comes to climate change issues in Iraq. The initiative will take two levels; the first level is performing sensing and exploring with organizations to collect data and information about the existing entities working on behavioral influence towards climate action and the second level is designing a specific social media initiative to collect data about the willingness of Iraqi individuals to change their behaviors and attitudes to support in tackling climate change, the effort and time they are willing to invest in such endeavors, and the overall effectiveness of behavioral change to support climate action. Human-Centred Design: the aim of using human-centered design, specifically design thinking in answering the learning question” &nbsp;What are the innovative tools we can use to positively change institutional and individual behaviours toward climate change in Iraq?”is to test the usefulness of ethnography in ideating for solutions that tackle the priority challenges set by the community and if these solutions will enhance action towards a climate in Iraq.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is a lack of sensor and sensor network data in Iraq, especially data that take a long-term perspective on the most suitable methods, tools, and local solutions that survive sustainable development. In Iraq data is scarce. There is a lack in both quantitative and qualitative data. In terms of quantitative there is a gap in reporting actual numbers and many different sources have different numbers, hence this hinders access to information.&nbsp; The active stakeholders in the ecosystem in tackling the climate change&nbsp; are not publicly visible. Hence there is a need to map the ecosystem and know who are the active players, the existing efforts and initiatives, and the possible collaborations to tackle the challenge..
