> Brief description about the identified local solution:

Knowledge Gate Organization looks forward to a sustainable economy in Iraq. 
Private sector companies are severely impacted by covid-19 lock-down. The impact varies from businesses who lost part of their market share to others who closed. This led to increased unemployment. The still existing businesses were impacted due to gaps in their administrative systems. 
On the other side, other businesses started at the time of lock-down, they are entirely costumed to match the requirements of lock-down, and they may not be useful in the post-pandemic period.
COVID-venture is a start-up training programme that gathers most common systemic problems from the struggling private sector companies, then trains youth entrepreneurs on problem solving methodologies, and business model. The solutions come in shape of a business model that is to be studied and rated by the companies, each company adopts one project that matches its scope and helps it operate better and sustain.
