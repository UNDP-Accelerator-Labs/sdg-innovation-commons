This solution uses the datasets of the job portal Infostud (leading career/job search portal in Serbia) on job advertisements, the structure of jobs offered, as well as the number and characteristics of people from different local communities in Serbia who are looking for employment abroad. By analysing these data, the team will find out how many people apply for a job abroad from year to year, where the jobs they are applying for are located, as well as how many applications for scholarships and internships abroad are made each year. Based on these data, one could gain insight into which industries are more and which are less represented in job advertisements, and thus also to which locations Serbian population most often emigrates.
