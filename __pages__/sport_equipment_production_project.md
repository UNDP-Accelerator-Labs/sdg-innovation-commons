> Brief description of the innovation

The sport equipment production project is an innovation that produces combat sport equipment using discarded local materials such as worn out clothes, form and scrap metal. This innovation aims to promote physical fitness through supplying of low cost and locally made combat sports gear to community members, local gyms, schools and hospitals. The innovation comes with aspects of skills training by forming partnerships with local organizations such schools and health institutions. This innovation will provide solutions to physical health needs, physical education in schools and climate change mitigation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income from sports gear sales and provision of training services to community members and various institutions like sports clubs, health and education institutions at competitive fees. 
The innovation will improve the operations of health, education and sports club.

Local gyms and sports centers like Olympic Youth Development Center will benefit from cheap sports equipment.  The prize will be used to fully start production, upscaling of production and marketing of sport equipment to all potential clients. 
The innovation is will lessen discarding of worn out materials like clothes through recovering and reusing them as raw materials, a practice that prolong their use and contribute to a clean and health environment. climate smart practice that will contribute to a cleaner, health local environment with pure water and air.

> Technical Feasibility

Implementation plan of the innovation involves organizing of a source for worn out materials such as worn-out clothes, scrap metal and forms. This will be done through advertising and door campaigns and putting a system for procuring and collecting. This will be followed by production of combat sports gear at a steady production rate and setting up of a demo gym in the neighborhood. After production advertising and marketing to potential clients by setting up of a shop in the central business district. To aid with smooth implementation process partnership will be formed with different institutions in the sectors of health and education.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Apart from the possibility of job creation, clean-up of the environment and health benefits of such an innovation, it can also encourage many youths to look to sports instead of vices. Adequate equipment has been proven to encourage consistency of participation in the practice of sports.
