Artisanal electric mill

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Artisanal electric mill designed and handcrafted by local workers in 
Thies, around 70 kilometers away from Dakar. These machines are 
destinated to local rural communities who have no access to modern imported
 machineries and rely on the local community artisans for this essential 
equipment. A variety of local meal or micro agricultural entrepreneurship require the transformation of the 
harvested cereals. 


These artisans also use recycled materials like wheels and iron sheets as components of the mill.
