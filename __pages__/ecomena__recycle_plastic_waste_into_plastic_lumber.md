The Solution:

Ecomena is developing a plastic waste recycling line to help reduce plastic waste in Iraq by turning plastic waste into sustainable, eco-friendly and long-lasting Plastic&nbsp;Lumber that uses in different applications such as residential, commercial and&nbsp;structural. In addition, it’s a great alternative to wood and PVC. Ecomena will be the&nbsp;first to market that serves locally and our product provides improved materials to&nbsp;replace wood and PVC; it’s water-proof, anti-chemical, anti-fungal, weather resistance,&nbsp;durable and affordable.&nbsp;Our mission is to solve one of the most important problems in Iraq which is waste&nbsp;management. We are committed to help reduce the amount of plastic waste by using it&nbsp;as a raw material for manufacturing Plastic Lumber. We believe that this can be&nbsp;achieved by implementing an innovative approach at every step of production process&nbsp;in order to lower costs while increasing quality control standards.
