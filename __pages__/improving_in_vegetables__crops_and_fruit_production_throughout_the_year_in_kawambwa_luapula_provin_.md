> Title of the innovation

improving in vegetables, crops and fruit production throughout the year in Kawambwa Luapula Province.

> Brief description of the innovation

I  has planted winter maize, vegetables (rape, chines, eggplants, onion, green paper, and carrots) and I  added more plants of bananas.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My aim is to produce vegetables, crops, and fruits on my five hectors farm to enhance food production in the community so that I can continue helping vulnerable school boys and girls who normally stop school because of fees and materials. I am currently teaching at Chitondo Primary School where I have seen pupils whom I have taught pass to go to grade ten and fail to report because of their poverty state. Currently, I am sponsoring three boys; one in grade 11 and two in grade 10In in the near future,
 I am planning to increase these productions if I will acquire an irrigation system. The stream has just passed in between my small farm which has a lot of water that runs throughout the year. If this will be in place it will increase the number of products to the maximum because Kawambwa is growing with the coming of industries such as ZAFICO, SUNBIRD, and more. So the market will increase. The farm is located along the road that goes to Luwingu and it is 14 KM from Kawambwa Town so taking the crops to the market will be very easy. In addition, the farm is just by the roadside.

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation plan is only an irrigation system so that the production will continue throughout the year. farming inputs are not a problem because I buy them in bulk but fail to cultivate a large piece of land because will require much manpower to water the crops.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Hopefully, if this can be done can reduce the number of pupils who stop school because of lack of support from their guardians and will also reduce deforestation in the sense that instead of cutting trees and burn charcoal because few will be employed on the farm if the production grows.
People nearby depend on charcoal burning and even people from the BOMA come to buy charcoal from this place called Chifinsa and when you come you will find charcoal bags along the road in nearly every house. If this will be successful, it will reduce deforestation because local people will be employed on the farm. And the number of employees will determine the innovation that is in place ( irrigation system).
The current market is very fruitful, even what we have planted so far are sold from the traders and they always bounce when they come to buy because of low production.
