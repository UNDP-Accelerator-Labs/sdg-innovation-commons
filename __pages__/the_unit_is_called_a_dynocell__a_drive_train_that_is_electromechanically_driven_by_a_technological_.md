> Title of the innovation

The unit is called a Dynocell, a drive-train that is electromechanically driven by a technological innovation called the Linear Electromagnetic Dyno-cell (The L.E.D Technology) that can generate electric power using purely electrical principles. The technology can replace the Combustion Chamber in a conventional engine with an electro-magnetic induction Chamber.

> Brief description of the innovation

The technology is novel and it is 100% electrical. Meaning it is a 100% Zero Carbon emission technology. Energy can be decarbonized by the innovation in a sustainable way while increasing the role of domestic and industrial sources in the energy mix.
The design is a unit called a Dynocell, a drive-train that is electromechanically driven by a technological innovation called the Linear Electromagnetic Dyno-cell (The L.E.D Technology).
It relates to the generation of electric power using purely electrical engineering principles. The L.E.D Technology is replacing the Gasoline Combustion Chamber in a conventional engine with an electro-magnetic induction Chamber. Thus the arrangement can provide electromechanical drive train to power automobiles, trucks, trains, ships, earth moving equipment, aircrafts and space aircraft. Thus, these mobile machines running on gasoline can be retrofitted with the L.E.D Technology and converted into an electric machine. This technology can give a new lease of life to automobile that are non-runners. The L.E.D Technology will also be used to provide motive primary power for Electric Power Generating Plants. Since these Dynocells will come in different sizes in relation to the power.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our objective is to make our innovation a trend setter that will transform the landscape of our automobile and energy sector. Our main revenue of the project will be drawn from Royalties. Steak holders of the automobile and energy sectors involved in manufacturing will subscribe. As much as we will be manufacturing the units for sale, our production line will be purely for product support purposes, customer feedback, research and development. According to our projected five years cashflows we hope to breakeven in the third year of business. Our projections are average figures based on the car count of the world (https://www.live-counter.com/number-of-cars/). Of course we know that there are other mobile machinery and stationary plant that will use the same innovation. 
The L.E.D Technology is holistic and inert to the influence of Global warming. It does not depend on climatic and geographic entities such as wind, sun, oceanic waves, geo-thermal power, fossil fuels, hydro power, nuclear power etc. and requires no charging. While most of these climatic and geographical entities are primary inputs for the production of the so called clean energies they are unsustainable, to a certain degree as they are directly influenced by Global warming and climate change.

> Technical Feasibility

The Dynocell is  a cluster  of  Linear magnetic poles that are  arrange in a like manner as pistons in a conversional combustion engine. 
These Linear magnetic poles work in unison using the L.E.D Technology 
and linked through  a crankshaft to produce a linear torque called Stroke  
to rotate the driveshaft  that turns the AC Generator
The Dynocell is  is modelled after the M-G SET.
 In an M-G set the Motor is an AC Motor while the Generator is a DC Generator. 
In a DYNOCELL the Motor is DC and Linear, while the Generator is an AC Generator. 
The DC Linear motor uses the L.E.D Technology 
The Dynocell unit is a ONE STROKE CYCLE that requires only one revolution of the crankshaft. Thus no intake, no compression, no exhaust.
 POWER is a High Voltage Electromagnetic Pulse (HVEP).

> Anticipated Social Impact

Were solar energy is being encouraged as an alternative source of energy amongst the poor and the informal sector and its communities, it is still limited to inductive and lighting loads. Heating is still heavily dependent on cutting down of our woodlands for charcoal and firewood, and burning fossil fuels in these communities, which make up 49% of the world population. Our technology can handle heating loads and is robust.
The L.E.D Technology is a solution to the global economical and scientific challenges of global warming and global power deficits as it is a cost effective and sustainable clean energy innovation. That will result into a striking balance between development and deployment of the technology, energy consumption and environmental conservation while cleaning our energy sources and greening our environmental resources.
I believe this Concept if well exploited and developed can transform the way electric power is generated and provide electric power for various cross cutting application. It is an endemic technology in view of its impact.
A cost effective and sustainable Green technology solution to the Global economical and scientific challenges which are hinged on overcoming climate change and global power deficits.
The technology is a novel and it is 100% electrical. Meaning it is a 100% Zero carbon technology. Energy being a cross-cutting Global issue would be decarbonizes by the innovation in a sustainable way while increasing role of domestic sources in the energy mix. The innovation can be embedded in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) and it can contribute to the Global Clean Energy quest.
