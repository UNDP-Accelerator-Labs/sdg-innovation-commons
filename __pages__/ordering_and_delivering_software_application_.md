The business will generate income basically in two ways, that is from product mark up and logistical charge share. The slight markup on all products will hopefully enable a good number of clients to buy into the innovation thereby helping the innovation achieve high volumes of sales on behalf of stores. We have come up with format of 80/20 share ratio on logistics. 80% of income on logistics goes to motorbike related expenses and 20% will be returned by Bwino. With high volumes of sales reasonable income is expected from this innovation.

> Technical Feasibility

Its an App designed for use by anyone, does not require training to use it, just following simple instructions on the same App to get desired results. The App guides the user every step all the way.
