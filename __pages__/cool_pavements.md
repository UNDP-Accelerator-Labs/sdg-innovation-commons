> Type of the Solution

Infrastructural

> Description of the solution

Using paving materials on sidewalks, parking lots and 
streets that remain cooler than conventional 
pavements, by reflecting more solar energy and 
enhancing water evaporation, not only cools the 
pavement surface and surrounding air but can also 
reduce stormwater runoff and Reflective pavements can enhance visibility at night this could reduce lighting requirements.

> Who lead the solution

Local Government

> Other Notes

Phoenix City Government
Cities such as Phoenix and Los Angeles have been using cool pavement in their neighborhood streets and have reported positive results in reducing roadway surface temperatures.
