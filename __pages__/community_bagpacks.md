Talibu Mane sews bag packs for children of the sector of Oio, which are made from local products and are sold at affordable prices. This is an example of positive deviance because when something happens to the backpacks, the tailor makes changes for free to support the most vulnerable children in the community as a way to give back and highlight the importance of education.
