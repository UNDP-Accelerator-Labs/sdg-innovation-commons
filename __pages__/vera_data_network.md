The solution is a data network that aims to collect accurate and systematic data on issues related to women, primarily femicides and violence against women, through female journalists working in local newspapers in Turkey, and to strengthen civil demands for remedial policies by supporting them with data. VERA includes local women journalists, non-governmental organizations and academic knowledge in the data collection process. It also collects data on the different sub-identities of women.
