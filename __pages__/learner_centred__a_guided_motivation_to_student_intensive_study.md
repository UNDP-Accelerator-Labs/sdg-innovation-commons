> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is anchored on encouraging and motivating students to study in a special way. In the first place the teacher prepares a schemes of work for a term as guided by a curriculum and syllabus. Then students in a concerned class are then divided in a number of groups as the number of topics indicated in the schemes of work. The students in a particular group are allocated a topic to be studied and then presented to the entire class in form of peer teaching. Students allocated to one topic are advised to form one study group to cover all sub topics under the given topic and at the end each member of the group is assigned a topic to present to the rest of the students in class. Examples and exercises are to be administered. Students are to be given one week to study before presentation. Topics to be covered in the particular term are availed to all students and all students are encouraged to study the topics given to other groups. The teacher is expected to provide guidance during the presentation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

One of the challenges encountered in the education sector, especially at secondary level, is that most of the students are not willing to study and participation in classroom activities is at the lowest level. In addition, the tradition way of teaching in most Zambian schools is teacher centered and this has contributed greatly to the passiveness of learners in class. In light of this scenario, the innovation is targeted at secondary school students and it will greatly improve on the study skills of the students and improve on the participation of the students in class. In addition, learner interaction is expected to improve through peer teaching and asking of questions. In addition to a traditional way of getting knowledge and information from the teacher, students will be able to learn greatly from their peers and this will in turn improve the confidence of the learners.

> Technical Feasibility

.The design of the innovation is that the teacher prepares a schemes of work for a term as guided by a curriculum and syllabus. Then students in a concerned class are divided in a number of groups as the number of topics indicated in the schemes of work. Study materials are given to the students. The students in a particular group are allocated a topic to be studied and then presented to the entire class in form of peer teaching. Students allocated to one topic are advised to form one study group to cover all sub topics under the given topic and at the end each member of the group is assigned a topic to present to the rest of the students in class. Examples and exercises are to be administered. Students are to be given one week to study before presentation. Presentation of work by the learners is to be done according to the sequence of topics in the provided schemes of work. The teacher is expected to provide guidance during the presentation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will greatly improve the study skills and participation in academic activities of students and that the innovation is relevant to students in a secondary school set up.
