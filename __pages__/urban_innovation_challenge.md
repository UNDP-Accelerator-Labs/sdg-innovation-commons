**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To foster grassroots innovation towards systemic urban resilience on three main themes: Smart city, Waste Management, and SME Digitization and encourage co-creation between innovators and urban communities.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If local innovators can work with grassroots urban communities to co-create solutions to the development challenges, the  innovation will address the needs of the community and allows them to become more resilient

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Curating local innovation, Bootcamp (co-creation, co-design, & mentoring), pitching session to select winners, prototyping phase

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

the data for each team in terms of technical feasibility, impact, and management

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Proposal submission, monitoring matrix, open data

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

- time allocation of Acclab team - in-kind support from a government partner
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

If local innovators can work with grassroots urban communities to co-create solutions to the development challenges, the innovation will address the needs of the community and allows them to become more resilient. The hypothesis is partially proven. The selected innovative solutions are developed based on the co-creation process between innovators and communities and are gender-responsive. 1. Digitalization of Local Fresh Market to Increase Social and Economic Impact in Yogyakarta 2. Participatory Smart Urban Resilience in Tegal District 3. Prevention of Food Loss and Waste Kramat Jati Market by Local Community Empowerment

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Crowdsourcing is beneficial, we received more than 100 applications. Co-creation workshops and mentoring with experts are useful for the innovators although should be made longer.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

25,000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, prototyping stage of 3 winners

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Planned with National research and innovation agency for social innovation challenge

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The excessive number of grassroots innovations created by local innovators. The primary learning of this experiment was how the local innovators could make more impact if they were equipped with more skills (co-design, system thinking, gender, etc.) and tools (theory of change, business model canvas, etc.).

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Time constraints, challenge to get more partners from the private sector.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The list of innovative solutions and partners

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Communities will benefit from the prototype phase, government exposed to a new innovation tools

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Essential to have government partners who have an interest on grassroots innovations

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, need to consider the interest of participants in the specific thematic area.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Heavily involved in the design the innovation challenge, boot camp design, partners engagement

> What surprised you?

Number of grassroots innovations, partners involved, high appreciation from the government on the approach.
