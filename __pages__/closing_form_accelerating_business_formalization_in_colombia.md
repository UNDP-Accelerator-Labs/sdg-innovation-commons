## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.    Formalization is understood by the institutions as a binary status: Formal or Informal, whereas for entrepreneurs and small business owners it is a complex process integrated by different steps that involve several institutions and procedures. We counted at least 20 steps in the formalization process.
2.    People and businesses in informality have different perspectives on its definition or implications, so that they may consider themselves to be formal, according to the level of sophistication of their businesses. In several cases informality is associated with illegality, so people consider to be formal because they don’t carry any illegal activity.
3.    Businesses are more competitive when they are informal, given the flexibility they can have in decision making and arranging contracts.
4.    The complexity, high costs and time-consuming processes involved in formalization discourage entrepreneurs to become formal.
5.    Several owners of small informal businesses don’t have an entrepreneurial mindset, but they are self employed as an alternative to the lack of formal job opportunities and the need of flexibility (For example to take care of their relatives). This kind of informal business is more common among people with lower education levels.

1.    We found it challenging to make a successful and time efficient call to gather enough participants and proposals for the five experiments and for the Collective Intelligence call. Here, the support from the allies with their own business data bases and confirming the participation of the entrepreneurs was indispensable.
2.    The coordination with the allies was a huge challenge along the project. First, to arrange the dates to carry the experiments, which involved the participation of several allies, and relied on individual schedules of events. This was also a big challenge given the change of government, because of the highly politicized public debate which could wrongly frame the Collective Intelligence call as linked to a certain candidate. This also made it a challenge to find the proper timing to open the call, which initially was set to be early April, and finally was agreed to be launched in October, once was finished the formal government transition process.
3.    Involve the government in the experiment was a challenge along the process. Finally, it was possible to connect with the Vice-presidency strategy of the Productive Inclusion Social Lab (Laboratorio Social de Inclusión Productiva) as the lead partner of this project. After the change of government there has been an effort to link the project with the initiatives developed by the Treasure Department (Ministerio de Hacienda), which is taking the lead on popular and informal economies and financial inclusion and may take over the findings of the experiments and the collective intelligence exercise.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Literature review and grey documents analysis: We carried this method to create a comprehensive understanding of informality causes and experiences closing the formality gap in small businesses. Interviews and Behavioral Insights: Through consultants we gather knowledge about constraints and motivations towards formality and informality, which led us to identify different segments of entrepreneurs and self-employed groups and to define what factors encourage or discourage formalization. During the Development of the 5 experiments, we followed up the development of the participants with structured interviews.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Behavioral Insights and Ethnography: We started by identifying the constraints and motivations to move from informal to formal systems. We had incorporated a consultant to identify behavioral barriers associated with the formalization process. Collective intelligence and crowdsourcing: Learning from our previous experience with Life Helmets, we want to launch an open challenge to identify, recognize and reward innovative and transformative initiatives that contribute, promote, or impact the increase in business formalization in Colombia. Prototyping & human centered design: We have design (through a human centered design based on our previous human understating about the formality challenges). Currently we are implementing 5 prototypes, testing which are the variables that can incentivize the most a formalization in MSMEs.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

EAN University: They where an ally in the development of the Collective Intelligence Experiment and we tried to set an experiment with their students, but it did not have enough participants to be carried out.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Private Sector: Bogotá Chamber of Commerce (Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá): They were a partner in the development of the experiments, and they shared they own insights on the informality phenomena in the city and the country. They help us with their own team to carry out the formalization process with the participants and showed interest in implementing the website prototype created by us for the experiment as a permanent tool they might use to simplify the process for their users.



Pixel Club: They are the development company that developed the websites for the experiments on the formalization process and the collective intelligence call. They have been highly supportive in understanding our intent and have showed alternatives to enhance our results with simple but powerful and adaptable solutions. We are proposing to work with them in other projects given the good results achieved so far.



> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

USAID: Is the initial partner of the project and provided the Lab with the funding for the development of the project.



Vicepresidency of the Republic (Vicepresidencia de la República): As part of the government, in 2021 the entity launched the Productive Inclusion Social Lab (Laboratorio Social de Inclusión Productiva), and its main goal was to focus on citizens in informal labour schemes or informal businesses, to improve the attention provided to them. This was aligned in two policy documents and two laws, related with entrepreneurship, business formalization, and street vendors. For this reason, the Vice-presidency was intendedto be the main beneficiary of this project.



Bogotá’s Economic Development Department (Secretaría Distrital de Desarrollo Económico): Was another ally for the development of the experiments, providing us with the entrepreneurs who participated in the experiments and other logistical assistance necessary to carry them out.


Tax Department (Departamento de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales – DIAN): Was one of the institutions that participated in the articulation of institutions and helped providing assistance and talks for the participants of the experiments.



National Retirement Fund (Colpensiones): Also participating giving talks to the participants of the experiments on the benefits of formalizing as individuals and having formal job schemes for employees.
