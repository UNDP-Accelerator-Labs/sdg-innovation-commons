Fabric Duster

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Entering the fabric shop, I noticed an object placed in the door handle. I asked the vendor what it was. He explained that it was a fabricated duster which he made out of the excess fabrics attached to a piece of wood. It was also interesting how this hack fit perfectly in the hole of the door handle which could be considered as a second hack; the fabric duster holder.
