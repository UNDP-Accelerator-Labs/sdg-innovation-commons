> Title of the innovation

Evershine Debt Managers

> Brief description of the innovation

Debt Collection involves the Collection of legal debt that is debt allowed by law to be owed . Debt Collection involves drafting demand letters , making calls and signing off payment plans.  To make this successful there is a debt collecting structure as follows. At the top of a debt collection structure is a legal officer followed by the key account manager s(KAMS) and at the lower level are the K9z. The work of the Legal Officer is merely to study contracts giving arise to debt to see if it's a contract worthy working on and thereafter draft a demand letter which will be given to the KAMs at the same time the legal officer is the final person who receives debt reports in Excel format and decides which case he/she will act on upon the KAMs and K9s failing to collect . The work of the KAMs is merely to get the demand letters from the Legal Officer and beging calling the debtor upon realising that the debtor is not complying give the letter to the K9s who will eventually deliver to the debtor. The K9s will follow up the demand letter if the debtor does not respond to in it in line with the instructions contained in the demand letter . When everything fails the Legal Officer will retain the next course of action. The chain is necessary to give an impression to the debtor that at each level there is authority being exercised and as the chain is being exhausted more serious action might be taken

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The income will come from two sources the debt collection commission and debt administration cost fees. Debt administration costs are non refundable fees that are are 1% of the debt book. These fees are paid upfront and are used for operation costs and for debt collection mission it's a percentage that's agreed upon and paid once and amount of the debt is paid an invoice will be sent to the Client. Usually the debt Collection commission is at 20% of the debt book. 
This innovation will enable businesses to maintain relationships even as the debt is being paid because a debt collector acts as a mediator and a reconciliater in the discharge of work. This intervention will help entities to be compliant to thier contracts and accountable to how monies are spent as well as help them channel money obtained as debt for rightful intended projects.
The targeted market is Banks and other registered entities that deal in credit facilities . 
This innovation will help the environment to be debt free to some extent and this in turn helps the government to reduce dependence of aid as the debt situation in the country is manageable .

> Technical Feasibility

There is a debt collection structure that has th following people starting with the most senior in the operation line . The Operations Manager, followed by legal Officer , Key Account Manager and K9z. The legal officer is charged with the duty to draft demand letters upon studying the contracts and delivering the same to the KAMs who will begin by making calls and if there is no compliance the demand letters will be given to the K9s who will deliver them to the debtor and wait for response as stipulated in the demand letter if there is non compliance the K9z follow up the demand letters with a forceful approach issuing verbal legal threat and if this fails the report is sent to the Legal Officer who will discuss it with the operations manager and advise the next course of action that's is legal process or the legal office will engage the debt himself. However, the K9z and Kams are supposed to deliver weekly reports to the Legal Officer who compiles the report and give the Operation Manager who then sends it after review to the Client. (The procedure above I have documented it in the debt collection manual to be released next year )

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation may employ a lot of youths and train them giving them an opportunity to do something in future of there own. 
As regards the market debt may reduce as entities will be more careful in using loaned money for rightful intended projects
