> Title of the innovation

Automated Legal Document Management System

> Brief description of the innovation

Most legal firms in Zambia are still using manual file management systems. This has resulted in a number of cases dragging due to missing files, elevated levels of lawyer stress in data search and management, inability of lawyers to work away from office, an unsatisfactory communication link between clients and legal firms, among legal firms, and the courts, and also extreme use of paper. Our innovation is a database management software for legal systems that I aimed at addressing these issues.

Ultimately, we intend to create a legal database management system that will be adopted by the  Ministry of Justice.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The system is intended to have a billing component in which accountants in the law firms will be able to track and communicate to clients the fees based on time spent on their cases. Through this platform the Zambian tax body , Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) will also be able to track taxes due by the firm, which will eventually contribute to the country's revenue.

The use of an automated data management system will help greatly help in cutting down the use of paper. This will have a positive impact on the environment in that the cutting of trees for paper production will reduce.

The software will be purchased by Law Firms on a monthly subscription basis. It will provide a convenient way of sharing, management and storing data electronically. This in turn will enable the Law firms to work efficiently, in good time, and transparently with the clients. This eventually will draw them more clients.

> Technical Feasibility

We have been proactive in implementing this innovation and currently have two law firms that are interested in partnering for a pilot project. We have taken the first step to document the  work flow process for these legal firms and will now enter the database design stage. 

Once designed, the database management system will be on trial for 6 months to a year during which we intend to monitor how well it works and provide capacity building for the interested parties.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The current market does not have an electronic data/file management system, electronic data storage  and all law firms are doing it manually. The innovation will help working remotely for law firms and the Zambia legal system, data sharing and  data storage. 

Clients of law firms will also benefit in that they will be able to track progress on their cases form their portal within the system. This will provide transparency and keep them at ease.
