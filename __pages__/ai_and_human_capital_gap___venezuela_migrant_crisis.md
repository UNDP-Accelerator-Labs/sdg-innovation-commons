## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

AI and Human Capital Gap – Venezuela migrant crisis
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to investigate new methods for offering refugees and migrants tools for their employment and economic development. There is a need for secure digital ID system to work specifically for the needs of refugees and migrants, who often flee without their physical certifications and medical documents.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

When people are forced to migrated, they often flee without their physical legal documents, certifications and/or medical documents. 

There is a need to move from humanitarian to development approaches towards the migration challenge in Colombia.

Overcome our mental barrier that perceives migration as a development issue and start seeing it as a development opportunity. 

In Colombia, there is a need to legalize the status of Venezuelan migrants. Which is why last year, we supported the government creating physical IDs that have legalized almost 2 million of Venezuelans. 

We have been exploring different ways and different approaches to make this idea happen. We even participated in the AI for CI event in Doha, Qatar.

According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), in 2022, approximately 2.2 million migrants live in Colombia, where 24.2% are in Bogota. In terms of data related to economic integration of migrants in Colombia: 

· The number of contributors to the General Social Security System (which seek to provide an approximation to migrants from Venezuela in formal work) with Special Permanence Permit - PEP and Temporary Protection Permit – PPT,  was 93.375 (annual average with PEP, 2021) and 14.180 (monthly average with PPT, 2022). 

· According to the micro business survey led by DANE, the owners of micro businesses that were born in other countries has increased in the last three years from 2.7% in 2019 to 4.2% in 2021. Also, 57.7% of the owners are men and 42.5% are women. In terms of sectors, in 2021 60% were in services, 28.8% in commerce, 8.8% in manufacturing, and 2.3 in agriculture and more. The number of micro-businesses that stated they did not have a single tax registry and the non-payment of health and pension in 2021, was 92.9% and 95% respectively, which are indicators that show the degrees of the informality of the population. 

· Lastly, on employability of migrants, there is an indicator that collects information related to the labor relationship that applied against a vacancy that is registered in the APE SENA application, where of 21 thousand registered they placed 2,097 migrants in 2021. For the 2020 and 2021 periods, 1.721 and 4.073 Venezuelan migrants, respectively, were evaluated and certified under the massive strategy to evaluate and certify competencies, called "Certificatón".

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our added value is our capacity to design and prototype in small scale what can be a possible solution that guarantee employment and economic development for migrants in Colombia. We have designed what we have called “Inclusive Employment Path (IEP)”. With this matching platform we hope to: 

· Increase the matching rate between labor supply and labor demand within vulnerable populations.

· Promote productivity within the private sector through the accommodation of workers with specific skills needed by this sector.

· Generate information that allows policymakers to adjust the skills taught in the educational system to the skills demanded in the labor market.

· Decrease migrant vulnerability by helping them to get a job that increases their income and, therefore, their exposure to poverty.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Leveraging the use of technology to address the Venezuelan migrant challenge of the human capital gap will allow us to see migration as an opportunity for human development in Colombia.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we locate and characterized the migrant population in Colombia to identify the economic and social context of the population? How can we explore and test new methods for offering refugees and migrants employment and economic development? How can we reduce the human capital gaps in Colombia? How can we leverage the use of technology to accelerate the socioeconomic integration of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Prototyping & human centered designed: Based on a characterization and understanding of our target group we will prototype in small scale what can be a possible solution that guarantee employment and economic development for migrants in Colombia. We have designed what we have called “Inclusive Employment Path (IEP)” 

Web scrapping: We can obtain data from employment websites. This technique will allows us to monitor the labor supply and labor demand. Our CO developed a web scraping tool using Phyton, with which we are able to read social networks such as LinkedIn and Elempleo.com (the most popular networks among job searchers in Colombia). 

Social understating: Using AI we aim to have a social understanding about our targeted group and their economic situation. We can identify which topics are the most talked about by the vulnerable population, which allows us to categorize their needs, the types of jobs they have, and several other factors that can be used to respond to different issues. This process can be done using AI tools such as Citibeats or Talkwalker, which allow us to organize people's opinions into insights, read trending topics and sentiment analysis.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

User journey: identifying the pain points and motivations behind the decision and the possibility of migrants to employ themselves will allow us to understand  and design a matching platform centered in their needs. Secondary data: for the web scrapping and social understating tool we will use existing data, platforms, digital means. Artificial Intelligence: Using AI can allow us to automatize tools and methods and obtain data in a more efficient and low cost way.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Creating Inclusive Employment Path (IEP) for migrants will provide us with learnings and lessons learnt, becoming an opportunity to scale in number of participants and scale for other vulnerable groups we work with.
