> Title of the innovation

Rural health outreach programme

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia has made some gains in growing its economy and improving its health outcomes. However, an elevated diseases burden, under resourced health system and poor infrastructure in its rural areas and lack of adequate stuffing, has stunted its progress in reducing the spread of HIV, malaria, and child and maternal mortality. According to the World Health Organization, children in Zambia still die from preventable diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS and malnutrition. Poverty still remains the major factor in combating the country’s health challenges.
Hence having a team of youths trained in various programmes willing to start a mobile outreach programme specifically in the rural most places will ensure at least an equitable and sustainable health programme

This innovation has been designed after various literature review ie that of world health organisation, Zambia: Country Profile and Opportunities for Innovation Katusha Devilliers Oct 19/2015.
Also looking into the capital base will also allow for various recruitments of essential health workers to work in this programme and there for also handling the shortage of availability of human resources

> Anticipated Social Impact

In a nut shell maternal and infant mortality rates will be reduced by at least half the current incident rates
