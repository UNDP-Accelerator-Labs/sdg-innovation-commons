> Title of the innovation

House of chilli &amp; spices (we grow chillies,onions,tomatoes etc)

> Brief description of the innovation

I grow chillies, tomatoes, onions, potatoes and flesh maize through irrigation methods and seasonal rain but mainly chilli and spices are the target

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated through sales from the products and since I use irrigation methods I don't depend on rain season only, the products will be available on the market in season and out of season 
Challenge prize will enable me to produce on large scale than my current production

> Technical Feasibility

My main focus is on chillies,tomatoes and spices because my vision is to start producing chilli and tomato sauces but I can't ignore the fact that flesh maize and potatoes add value to my business, therefore, I  shall continue producing them as added products

> Anticipated Social Impact

Other people can benefit from this innovation through Employment if the business grows to large scale production because it will mean that I will need more people to assist in the production and selling. 
It also improves the lives of people healthwise as all the products mentioned above are food and benefits the body. 
The demand on the market is high it's only the supply that is low,recently we experienced the shortage of onions on the market which led to higher prices of the commodity in the copper belt and some other parts of the country and we usually experience the shortage of these mentioned commodities(chillies, tomatoes, onions and also flesh maize )in certain seasons of the year which leads to high demand and high prices. 
My vision and focus is to ensure that there is availability of these products in season and out of there seasons
