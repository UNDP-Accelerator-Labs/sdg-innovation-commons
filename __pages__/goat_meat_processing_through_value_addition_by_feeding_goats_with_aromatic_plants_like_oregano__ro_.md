> Title of the innovation

Goat meat processing through value addition by feeding goats with aromatic plants like oregano, rosemary and sage that improves the shelf life of goat meat, taste and tenderness

> Brief description of the innovation

Goats will be bought from farmers and brought at our holding farm to be fed for a few weeks. The innovation will involve processing of goat meat through value addition using ingredients that improve the shelf life of meat, taste and tenderness by feeding goats with aromatic plants like oregano, rosemary and sage before slaughter. This promote fresh goats’ products/fed with these aromatic plants. Goats will be fed when they are brought at our feedlot. Product processing will also include freeze drying for longer storage and exportation to big markets like china, Saudi Arabia.
The innovation is based on an innovative commercial scale aggregation, processing and supplying of goat to large scale buyers in Zambia. Goats are the second most popular livestock owned /reared by small scale farmers in Zambia, hardy and able to live on a wide range of available grasses/plants. Urban consumers have no easy access to goat meat hence our innovation on the large scale goat meat processing will make available improved access, tractability, quality/consistency supply of the products to these consumers especially the food safety consumers. 
The innovation will also include the processing of hides/sold to tannery involving salting of hides to improve curing and quality.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Estimated budget $ 70,000 working capital, acquire vans and other items. The challenge prize will help the business as it will enable us to buy in large quantities goats, sale processed goat meat to big buyers at premium prices, help to negotiate good contracts, supply constantly to buyers. It will generate income for farmers, traders, supermarkets, butcheries as they will have products to sale. It will help operations of others as the goat buyers will only already processing instead of slaughtering, transporting.
Lusaka in Chibolya and Kasumbalesa ,200 to 300 goats are sold per day of each year. Zambia signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2016 to export a million goats to Saudi Arabia on an annual basis.The business will create opportunities of utilizing livestock market to link smallholder farmers to markets. This increased income levels and rapid urbanization in Zambia /changes in consumption patterns has contributed directly to the growing demand for livestock related products. Potential off takers, Termites, ZAMBEEF, Food Lovers, Saudi.
Value addition of innovation on environment will be that all goats’ waste and other disposable materials from the process will be collected/disposed in an environmentally friendly manner to avoid smell,diseases and other unwanted social conflicts with the environment agency/community.

> Technical Feasibility

The design is based on processed goat meat. Goat feed will be supplemented with aromatic plants like oregano, rosemary, sage and fed to goats before slaughter at the 5 ha land, where a feedlot, an abattoir and slaughter house will be located. The goats will be fed for a short period of time to ensure they get enough of the proposed Humane slaughter will be done to ensure food processing standards are observed. These plants will be mixed with feed as a supplement for goats. It is found that goats that feed on this diet give healthier meat, milk for humans, antioxidant properties. All slaughtered goats will be processed using processing machinery, cutting,packaging,weighing as designed according to specifications.

> Anticipated Social Impact

•	This innovation leads to improved productivity as goats gain weight by at least 8%
•	It also leads to rate of feed conversion
•	Contributes to quality of meat and long shelf life of animal products
•	Zambia’s livestock sector plays a pivotal role in the socio-economic development of both the rural and urban population as Goats are the second most popular owned livestock by most smallholder farmers in Zambia at the household level
•	Its role goes beyond the provision of food and nutrition in people’s diets  
•	Act as a risk buffer by providing an alternative source of income in case of crop failure.
•	livestock serves as a valuable wealth asset accounting for 20% of the productive assets (Lubungu and Mofya-Mukuka 2012) for rural communities. 
•	The smallholder livestock production contributes to income generation and features prominently in cultural transactions such as dowry payments, and settlement of disputes, as well as payment of school fees and other necessities. 
•	It also acts as a risk buffer by providing a means of reducing the risks associated with crop
failure and a diversification strategy for resource-poor farmers (Swanepoel, Stroebel, and Moyo
2010). 
•	Contribute to poverty alleviation and job creation
•	It helps to maximize profits, production and sales volumes per annum
•	They also used for traditions, customs, culture purposes such as paying dowry
•	Livestock act as a store of wealth, a risk management tool and as such, income needs
rather than price changes drive the marketing (Rich et al. 2011). 
•	More women easily keep goats with small land as men prefer cattle to goats
•	It will create new opportunities for other businesses that supply materials and services
•	Staff will acquire new skills and knowledge in marketing and food technology or goat meat processing using new techniques. 
Relevance of Innovation to current market 
Goat meat is highly consumed by most people and the only lacking link to formalise marketing in terms of packaging, to be sold in chain stores or malls on a large scale. Most people would want to eat goat meat but are normally put off as it is not easily found in packaged form or already slaughtered in most supermarkets or malls. The national annual consumption of goat is higher compared to supply. In southern Africa, goat meat is the second most popular meat consumed after beef. Identified buyers are the general public. Demand is projected to go up based on the prevailing demand from the local market, Saudi Arabia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rapid urbanisation coupled with diet diversification, increased household income and population growth has enhanced the demand for livestock products including goat meat in Zambia. Demand for goat meat is growing in Zambia’s urban areas as well as in neighboring countries.
The project will help meet the following targets.
We will be able to process at least 15,000 kilograms of processed goat meat at an estimated sales value of K1,125,000  at K75 per kilogram per month.Further ,we will process at least 1,000 goats hides per month as by product.
