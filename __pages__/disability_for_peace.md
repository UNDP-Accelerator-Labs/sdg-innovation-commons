## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The primary goal of the experiment is to foster the participation of Persons with Disabilities (PwD) in peacebuilding initiatives by establishing strategic alliances and ensuring security through the following actions.

1. Identifying key strategies to integrate inclusion and a disability-focused approach into the project with Norway.

2. Positioning UNDP within the ecosystem and advancing the disability policy agenda.

Key dependent variables include:

- Otherness, understood as the perception of PwD as equals and essential contributors to the construction of social peace.

- Empathy, encompassing both affective and cognitive empathy, fostered through direct exposure to personal life stories and shared spaces.

- Articulation, defined as the ability to collaborate with the ecosystem to promote the social and productive inclusion of signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If meeting spaces are facilitated, then empathy towards signatories, victims and participants with disabilities will increase.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

To assess the impact of creating a dedicated space for interaction and recognition of Persons with Disabilities (PwD) on fostering empathy (reducing biases and increasing willingness to include), a controlled test was designed with two distinct phases.

These phases aim to connect decision-makers with the experiences and capabilities of signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities. The key variable is the frequency of interaction with PwD. The experiment includes two groups:

Control Group: Members of civil society, randomly selected.

Treatment Group: Individuals who visit the gallery and participate in the workshop.

The evaluation instrument used was a questionnaire designed to measure levels of empathy and potential biases toward signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities. This instrument was administered to up to 30 individuals in each group..

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The results of the experiment broadly validate the initial hypothesis, demonstrating a positive disposition among participants toward individuals with disabilities. From a behavioral perspective, this shift reflects a progression from otherness to empathy, enabling collective action and fostering collaborative efforts in both the short and medium term.

In contrast, survey results from members of civil society without direct connections to the disability or reintegration ecosystem reveal tendencies aligned with otherness, antipathy, and segregation.

The hypothesis underlying the experiment posits that individuals with prior sensitization exhibit greater empathy and a heightened willingness to collaborate with people with disabilities. This readiness, whether observed before or after an intervention, is attributed to their cognitive and social exposure to the realities faced by individuals with disabilities.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

To foster empathy and facilitate collective action for the social inclusion of signatories, victims, and participants with disabilities, the following recommendations are proposed:

Invest in Awareness: Develop and promote programs and activities aimed at increasing disability awareness. Such initiatives can significantly impact by transforming biases, attitudes, and behaviors, thereby fostering greater empathy and recognition of otherness.

Understand the Population Spectrum and Stakeholder Map: It is essential to identify where individuals and stakeholders fall on the spectrum of awareness and empathy. This understanding will enable resources, investments, and efforts to be directed toward building alliances that enhance and support collective action. This approach prioritizes complementing and enabling collaboration rather than solely generating emotional and cognitive empathy.
