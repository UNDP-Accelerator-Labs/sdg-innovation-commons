It is a graphic and explanatory guide that gathers valuable learnings about the classification of solid waste in Guatemala. Its objective is to educate and raise awareness among the population about the context of waste in Guatemala and help them to begin to separate their waste to improve the collection and recycling chain, creating value and protecting the environment.   


The guide is an effort that seeks to contribute to the fulfillment of governmental agreement 164-2021, which establishes that all generators of solid waste must begin to classify from the source.
