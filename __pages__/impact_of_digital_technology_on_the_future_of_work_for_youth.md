## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Impact of digital technology on the future of work for youth 


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is a lack of comprehensive data on the emerging trend of skill mismatch between labor market supply and demand in the face of evolving digital technology, particularly concerning youth employment within the context of climate change and the new technological wave. We aim to explore the implications of digital technology (such as AI) on youth employment and green skills to align with SDGs, striving for informed interventions and policies. 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The challenge of understanding digital technology's impact on youth employment in Vietnam arises from rapid technological changes. Globalization, automation, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution are driving shifts in job requirements. The current situation involves emerging opportunities but risks a skills gap, leading to unemployment and reduced employability, especially among disadvantaged youth. This challenge demands tailored interventions to equip youth with essential skills for a digitally transformed job market. 



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Official data from the Vietnamese Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs shows a gradual decline in demand for certain manual and routine jobs alongside a rise in demand for roles requiring digital and analytical skills. This shift indicates the need to adapt the education and training system to cater to the changing job market.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Recent reports from local businesses highlight difficulties in finding candidates with a blend of technical and soft skills. Job descriptions are evolving, requiring skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and adaptability – all of which are essential for the technology-driven economy.34

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Our UNDP Accelerator Lab offers a unique value proposition to tackle the challenge of skills mismatch between present and future employment in Vietnam. While other UN agencies like UNICEF and UNFPA focus on youth and ILO on labor and employment, there is currently no specific research on the skill mismatch between those in present and those in the future. Through historical data research by ILO and innovative tools, Accelerator Lab will illuminate future skill demands. At the same time, by connecting youth voices through public sector innovation and empowering their participation in policy-making, we contribute to bridging the skills gap, fostering sustainable youth employment, and driving inclusive growth.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Engaging early with local educational institutions, vocational training centers, and industry associations will be crucial for the successful implementation and scaling of our strategies. Key champions in the government (such as Ministry of Education and Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs) and private sector who recognize the importance of upskilling the workforce for the digital technology era should also be informed and involved in our effort
