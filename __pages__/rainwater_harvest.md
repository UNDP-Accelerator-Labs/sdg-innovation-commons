> Title of the innovation

Rainwater Harvest

> Brief description of the innovation

Harvesting of rainwater involves the capture of the rainwater, storage and treatment of the rainwater. 
Capturing of the rainwater will be done from gutting of roofs and collection of run off form drainages. when substantial amounts are captured they can contribute greatly to the supply of a society. On a small scale, especially in the rural with no proper water networks, the amounts collected can be used for potable water, sanitation and irrigation.
In larger towns, the captured water will contain fewer impurities thereby reducing the cost of purifying the water. the captured water may also help alleviate shortage of water supply.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In order to generate income, an annual percentage of profits can be agreed upon with the company that adopts this idea. 
In larger towns, the captured water will contain fewer impurities thereby reducing the cost of purifying the water. the captured water may also help alleviate shortage of water supply.
It can assist poor communities especially donated to schools and healthcare facilities.

> Technical Feasibility

The main means of collection of rainfall water are gutters on roofs. Town centres will be advantageous because buildings are closer to one another making collection from different catchments into one reservoir easier. Drainages will be used to collect surface runoff, if drainages are cleaned regularly, the water quality may be improved to help reduce on purification chemicals to be used.
In rural areas, the water can be collected off a roof of a school which can then be used to clean the ablution blocks and gardening.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation would increase water supply for potable and sanitation purposes and help collect relatively clean water or water that is cheaper to purify.
