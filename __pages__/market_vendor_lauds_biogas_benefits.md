Two biogas units were installed at the Port Vila City market house to supply methane gas to the food vendors at the food vendors. This biogas is sourced from horse manure that was brought in by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development several months ago. The waste from biogas production is a liquid that vendors use around the market house as a source of fertilizer. Some of the market vendors also use this in their gardens.
