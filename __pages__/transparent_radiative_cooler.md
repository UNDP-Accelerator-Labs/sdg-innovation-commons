> Description of the solution

Scientists at the University of Notre Dame are developing a clear coating that lowers temperaturess without expending a single watt. It allows visible light, while reflecting warm infrared and ultraviolet rays into outer space. Coating consists of common materials like silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminium oxide or titanium dioxide. Alternating layers are placed on a glass base and topped with a film of spreadable oil called polydimethylsiloxane. Artificial intelligence was used with computer models to calculate the type, order and combination.
