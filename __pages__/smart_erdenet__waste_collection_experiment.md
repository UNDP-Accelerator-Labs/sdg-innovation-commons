## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

As part of Smart Erdenet initiative, we tested 2 types of waste bins in the semi-informal settlements in Erdenet, Mongolia for 45 days to see whether we can have efficiency. The centralized waste bins were for 100 households in each location and had 4m3 waste capacity, recycling bins, camera, street lighting, and information board. 

1).Waste collection could be more economically efficient with one of the designs, but waste collection requires various groups to be in harmony for effectiveness. 

2). Community waste disposal behavior affects the collection significantly.

3). Behavior depends on previous ways of disposal, location of the bin, visibility of the bin, cleanliness of the bin area. Surprisingly, recycling behavior was easier to acquire for the people. We believe previous campaigns helped people, but didn't provide any outlets.

4). Experiment boundary was challenging to enforce as people outside would dispose of their waste. 

5). Behavior of the disposal will directly affect how frequent the bins are filled and it is extremely irregular as households would collect their waste in their plots in large amounts and dispose every

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There are many groups involved in Erdenet waste management, and it was quite challenging to agree on a particular experiment design because everyone had their agenda. Since we need to make sure the results are used for the future interventions, we needed their cooperation. So, one of the designs were from Waste Management Agency.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There were very little existing data on the current behavior and patterns. Before the experiment we deployed city-wide quantitative survey and rapid ethnographic interview to get general understanding. We used camera recording for observation and direct interviews with the resident after the experiment.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We designed 2 different types of waste bins to test with the community. While testing we realized 1 prototype could improve collection efficiency, but residents behavior is challenging to change in the experimental stage and will define whether it fails or succeeds.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with Science and Technology Park in Erdenet. But we worked with an NGO on the other waste experiment, which is not completed. These 2 experiments and partners coordinated and shared some insights.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Our main implementing partner was local Science and Technology Park, which is a government entity. Together we finalized the 2 waste bin prototypes and location details. They coordinated and managed waste collection and monitoring process. We designed evaluation together, and currently we are developing learning insights.

One of the other partners is the local Waste Management Agency and Governor's Office of Erdenet. We coordinated with them to learn about their current operation as well as share our insights. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All partners were new and unusual. UNDP Mongolia CO usually works directly with government entities on capacity building type of work. Our work was unusual because we worked with all the major players within the waste management system. Instead of building capacity of our partners, we learned together through this process. It's a very open cooperation and engagement.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The evaluation is not finalized, so we are in the process of developing documents for this learning.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
