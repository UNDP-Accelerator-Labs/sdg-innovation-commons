Nazeem Nisha (Innovator) is the founder of Microgreens Fiji. Like many others, Nazeem lost her job due to the pandemic in 2020. As a single parent she found it very difficult to cope and so decided to apply for assistance under the innovation project funded by the Australian government. With this innovation of hers, Nazeem grows a mixture of fenugreek, mustard, radish, and beetroot packs and already has an established market selling to hotels in Nadi and on the outer islands, high-end cuisine restaurants, and individuals on a weekly basis.

Nazeem has a new idea of turning her microgreens into powder and requested a food dehydrator which was provided with support from Pacific Island Farmers Organization Network (PIFON) and Foundation 4 Rural Integrated Enterprise & Development which she can now turn this idea into a reality.
