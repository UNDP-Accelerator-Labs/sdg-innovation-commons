The Emigrant Support Programme funds projects that will: - Celebrate, maintain and strengthen the links between Serbia and Global Serbians; Address the diverse and evolving needs of Serbian emigrants, especially the elderly, disadvantaged and vulnerable; - Facilitate access to statutory and voluntary services in their country of residence for Serbian emigrants; - Foster a more vibrant sense of community and of Serbian identity, notably through initiatives focusing on arts and culture - Support business networks to connect Serbian people to each other at home and abroad; - Research and define the emerging needs of Serbian communities abroad; - Support development of new ways to communicate and connect with the increasingly diverse global Serbian, including non-traditional, diasporas; - Improve awareness and understanding of the emigrant and diaspora experience. While the Programme is primarily designed to assist Serbian community and voluntary organizations in delivering these goals, it also supports strategic initiatives within its overall framework.
