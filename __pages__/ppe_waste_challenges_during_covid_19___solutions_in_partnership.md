AccLab Uzbekistan with private sector and government set up behavioral insight experiment during lockdown. A Large number of single-use masks and gloves are being discarded everywhere around the Tashkent city, especially at the entrances of grocery stores, on the sidewalks of the streets, etc. Exploration of this issue in the Lab made us realize that in the near future PPE waste would become a growing problem not only for the Public Health but also for the environment. So, we used this moment and decided to learn more about people’s attitudes toward certain incentives during the COVID Pandemic. In partnership with private grocery chain and waste collection company, we are testing out following solution:

installing labelled safe disposal containers for collection of PPE waste at 32 large grocery’s stores, and large labelled containers at 150 waste collection stations in the most populated neighborhoods in Tashkent city
