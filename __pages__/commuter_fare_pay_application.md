An application meant to ease the hustle and stress of always having physical cash whenever you wish to use public transport such as taxi's and buses. We wish to see the use of digital currency enhanced to also contribute to the reduction of misappropriation of funds and theft which will lead to efficient accountability and management of funds realized.
