- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By receiving prescriptions from people in need from hospitals, it will enable the business to grow very fast. In rural areas, there are shortages of medicine in hospitals, so we can sell to them and help the business to grow fast. As we sell, we can make good profits.

It is a building shop structure and medicine or drugs are sold to people in need from the same store.
I want to grow it to a pharmacy. A pharmacy will manage all those people in need of medicine within and outside activity area.

Many people will benefit from the pharmacy, as they will have enough medicine to buy. There will be no shortage of medicine within and outside activity area.
