## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

1. What type of treatment are required to make the effective smart tour guide and responsive to the emergency situation?

2. How can different workshops, seminars, training modules, and tools build the capacity of tour guides and increase the supply side for tourists at different tourist spots?

3. What are the specific skills and attitudinal behavior of the tour guides that can attract more tourists at the tourist spots?

4. How tourist satisfaction and intention of traveling (by smart tour guide) can increase the income of informal workers and generate more youth employment?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF the understanding and responsibilities of a smart tour guide can be enabled through sense-making, THEN it will build their capacity as well as confidence to handle the emergency situation while guiding the tourists.

H2: IF the attitude of the tour guides can be managed in an appropriate way, THEN it will meet the demand and satisfaction level of the tourists.

H3: IF specific behavioral factors of local tour guides can be identified and considered through providing specific tools, THEN more tourists will be attracted to travel in those places creating more local employment for the informal workers.

H4: IF the number of tourists can be increased through branding smart tour guides in connecting the unemployed youth and informal workers, THEN it will generate more employment opportunities for the unemployed and improve their standard of living.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, the original hypothesis was proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It is our observation that, the methodology we used has worked well on our experiment. So, this methodology can be used for similar approaches in future.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

12 Months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 27,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, based on the impact assessment there could be minor adjustment or follow-up of the program in order to evaluate the programs' effectiveness. And there is a continuous development and monitoring of the activities.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, this initiative was planned to scale through developing and equipping proper smart tour guide system and replicating this in multiple tourist zones. The process implies a whole of society approach partnering with local community, local tour guides, tour operator association, Local Government Institutions, Local Administration, Bangladesh Tourist Police, Bangladesh Tourism Board, UNDP projects, ILO and University of Dhaka.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

Provided below

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1. It was not realized before that well-equipped smart tour guide is also required to increase the tourist satisfaction at the expected level; 2. The main learnings during this experiment are: the tour guides were not aware of the term "Smart Tour Guide" that can attract more tourist and increase their level of satisfaction. Moreover, capacity building, behavioral trainings and other tools development can increase the capacity and ability of the tour guides to provide quality services to the tourists that can ultimately help in increasing the number of tourists and their income.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Limited number of participants were facilitated with the sensemaking, training, and capacity building opportunities against a large number of correspondents.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

As this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit the whole AccLab team under UNDP. As because this experiment has created opportunities to work on developing smart tour guide nationally as well as globally at large scale with different Government and Non-Government organizations particularly for Bangladesh Tourism Board and Bangladesh Tourist Police.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The informal workers more specifically the unemployed youths and existing tour guides also including the tourists might get benefit from the results. The unemployed youth and tour guides can be benefitted as smart tour guide can increase the tourist satisfaction which will lead to the increase of tourist and as a result of this more employment opportunities would be created. Similarly, the tourists might also be benefitted as they would avail more smart and enriched services compare to the traditional services from the tour guides.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, this experiment requires a certain number of iterations. As the AccLab has a smart tour guide plan to provide 7+ different smart tour guide treatments to more than 500+ participants at 12 different locations in Bangladesh. The reason behind these initiatives is to ensure decent behaviour and smart tourist services so that it can increase tourist satisfaction at the expected level which will help to raise the number of tourists at the respective tourist spots which has ultimate effect on informal employment and increase income of tour guides in the interior locations where poverty rate is above 50%.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Before initiating or replicating the experimental activity, they should examine the contextual background whether they need this kind of experimental activities or not. At the same time, cross checking with other country contexts, identifying the actual participants, ensuring efficient and expert trainers, providing necessary tools etc. are also needed to be considered while replicating this activity.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, Informality, Blue Tourism, Behavioral Insights, Youth Connection. SDG 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 17

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The whole smart tour guide experiment depended fully on sensemaking and exploration activities; Solution Mapper and Explorer were closely involved in the entire process of this experiment.

> What surprised you?

Surprisingly, all the relevant stakeholders including Tour Guide Associations, Tour Operators' Associations, Bangladesh Tourism Board, Bangladesh Tourist Police, public and private sector as well as tourists welcomed the experiment wholeheartedly and showed their keen interest to further working with the Accelerator Lab on this experiment.
