Creating personal bonds between green public spaces and citizens

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

On one of our daily walks with my gf, we noticed that our favorite street in the city, has 'name tags' on the trees crown with names from what appeared to be people from the city. We both thought it was a very cute initiative and began talking about the intended effects from it. We latter learned that there are several initiatives like this one, spearheaded by the administration of the city of Skopje. Bellow is a photo illustration from one of those initiatives.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The official interpretation for this action [as suggested by the administration of the city of Skopje] is that it creates bonds between the citizens and the green spaces in the city. Moreover, the City of Skopje in the past 10 years has seen massive deforestation of the city’s green areas  due to building activities. The rates are astonishing and if Skopje in the turn of the new millennium was considered a green city with 75.649 m2 green areas that have decreased today to only 18.680 m2 green areas. Today the city of Skopje has 40% less trees per capita than the EU average.  

In addition to that, our team’s interpretation is that: for a city where ‘green spaces’ are a scarcity this tool can also serve as a public awareness campaign about the importance of green public spaces for the sustainability of cities.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

From this observation we can learn that in order for some initiatives to work you have to have the people/public’s buy-in, or sense of belonging in the initiative/or project.
