> Brief description of the innovation

The idea of this project started way back in 2018 after completing my studies in Agricultural Processing and this is when i visited my home town mpika and noticed that the prices of cooking oil in the area is extremely expensive despite the area been polluted by groundnuts farmers who dont have market for their products which results in selling it at a very cheaper prices and most of it wasted due to poor storage facilities by local farmers. And this triggered the inception of my project.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

According to my research the project will easily penetrate the market by producing the affordable(cheaper) cooking oil because in my target Area of Shiwan'andu, mpika, Chinsali, kasama and isoka their is no cooking oil industries as we rely on imported oil from neighbouring Tanzania therefore  import duties and transportation costs will be cut off from my oil and theirby reducing the price.
And the project will also engage farmers as outgrowers to ensure sustainability of raw materials whilst at the same same time generating income to local farmers in the area.

> Technical Feasibility

Groundnut is chosen because it has the highest oil content among oil seeds and the variety to be given to outgrower farmers will be with the highest oil content to maximize oil production.
I will be glad to share a full project plan where step by step production is explained.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will highly improve economic status of the area as it will employ the local people both directly and indirectly as outgrower and at the same time create market to their products and this improve the living standard of local people in the area.
