Called Pressure-type kerosene stove, it is an improved version of the conventional one. The thermal efficiency, cooking power, color of the flame, soot on the vessel etc. have been adequately taken care of. Even the sound, while using the stove, has been reduced. Pressure type kerosene stove: The severe shortage of petrol based liquid fuels is no new in India. It is found that domestic and commercial stoves are run only on kerosene. There are two types of kerosene stoves - the wick & pressure or pump types. The former one is low in power and slow to cook & the latter one gives loud noise in operation. It is evident that to enhance efficiency of domestic stoves, efforts should be concentrated to minimize the two major losses - plus gas and radiation/convection. From test results it is estimated that such a simple, yet effective, measure can reduce oil-consumption. This is the basis of designing the improved version of pressure-stove in the proposed industrial unit. The conceptual diagram of the product newly conceived is shown in appendix III. For ease of understanding, the figure is shown with the oil tank removed, so that the concept of furnace cover can be fully demonstrated. Due to cost considerations ultimately the inner surface of the covers was not made shiny. Arranging to rivet the two plates together and then drilling could fabricate the covers. This pressure type kerosene stove widely used in India and consuming 10 million tones of oil annually on a conservative estimate. The market for Pressure Stove could be greatly increased by developing a safety type unit and also units employing non - pressure type of mechanism. This entrepreneurial - innovative project has effected potential saving of 50% or more, i.e. 5 million tones of kerosene annually, but is yet to take off due to financial constraints & other entrepreneurial stumbling blocks prevalent in the country.
