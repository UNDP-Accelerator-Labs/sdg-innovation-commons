The greens are nurtured indoors in a highly-controlled environment, based on the principles of hydroponic with filtered water. The system is supported by AI platforms, enabling the growers to continuously gather data and improve the system. 

The system uses patent pending Machine Farms and Tower Farms technology to grow in a modular system with a diversity of cultivars. The flexibility to scale up is based on demand from the local communities. The system is/has: 

1. Space efficient and scalable: the modular racking system allows planting of variety of greens, with the option of scaling up according to demand. 
2. 95% less land used: the modular stacking system saves space. By stacking the trays with zero compromise on taste and nutrition, valuable real estate space is saved. 
3. 95% less water used: the farms use far less water than traditional farming. Nutrient-enhanced filtered water are placed in direct contact with the roots, reducing water wastage and enhancing efficiency. 
4. A year-round harvest: the climate-controlled facility enables shorter plant cycles, lower yield loss and year round harvest. 
5. Controlled lighting: controlled and customised LEDs ensure optimal and balanced growing conditions. The lighting spectrum for each produce is carefully managed for better yield and energy-efficiency. 
6. Continuous improvement: the cloud-connected IoT farms collect multiple data points to help the farms grow healthier, tastier greens. The farms also have a live data feed and an analytics system to guide crop cycles for optimum harvest.
