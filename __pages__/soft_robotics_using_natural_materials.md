Soft-robotics are based in Bio-inspired design or biomimicry and have applications in wearables, rehabilitation prosthetics, surgical robots, rescuing and others. I focused on the fabrication of soft actuators, sensors and grippers using novel materials, artificial muscles and performative locomotion design.

The Highlight of this week was experimenting on bio exploration drafting my own Bio silicone - embedding food waste from olives (usually thrown in the garbage at the end process of extracting Olive Oil) so instead of throwing this garbage here I am making soft-robotics out of them and ill explain below how I did it
