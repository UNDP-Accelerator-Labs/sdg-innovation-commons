## SMS Jovem/U-Report is a free and anonymous service designed for adolescents and young people, operating on any mobile phone. It focuses on gathering opinions and information on topics such as employment, discrimination, and sexual and reproductive health. U-Reporters actively participate by responding to polls, reporting issues, and supporting youth rights.

The system comprises three modules:

1- SMS or WhatsApp requests: Users can send questions via SMS to U-Reporters, who respond with menu-based or personal messages.

2- Real-time polling/monitoring: This module gauges youth opinions on issues related to demand, access, prevention, care interventions, and behavioral changes.

3 - Campaigns: Mobilizing young people for positive community contributions, this module gathers valuable information to enhance their lives.

U-Report's primary goal is to address social norms and enhance understanding of knowledge, attitudes, and practices among youth. It plays a crucial role in promoting positive social and behavioral change, well-being, and health-seeking behaviors. Counselors provide anonymous support on various themes, including HIV prevention, family planning, early pregnancy, menstrual health, mental health, COVID-19, and employment.

In Angola, SMS Jovem/U-Report boasts over 95,000 enrolled adolescents and young people. Any Angolan with a cellphone can join the service by simply sending a message to 140, and it's free for UNITEL users.
