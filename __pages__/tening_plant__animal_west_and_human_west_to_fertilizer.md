> Title of the innovation

Tening plant, animal west and human west to fertilizer

> Brief description of the innovation

Plant,animal and human West's  are important resources in fertilizing new plants. It is for this reason that composting West's have been allowed by first world health organization and the process is welcome or silent in other countries. 
My  innovations will introduce crashing plant West's from market and cities then combine them with human fecal matters and compost them together for a period of  28 days 
This process of composting will kill all the harmful viruses and bacterias hence making it safe for use in farms.
This system of fertilizing plants is more sustainable than using chemical fertilizer which are more expensive and slowly destroys soil structure as well as making the land Buren.
The fertilizer produced from the combination of plants west and human manure has the ability to improve soil capilality and  soil texture as well as controlling or maintaining the required level of acidity in the soil.
The composted fertilizer has no health effects such as the ones caused by chemical fertilizer.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The cost of fertilizer especially urea will be reduced and the cost of agriculture products will be lowered
Fertilizer  in Zambia has a huge market and it is always on high demand as well as not enough for the farmers in the country. 
This will mean that I am sure  of market of my commodity.
Using the produced fertilizer in my farm is another way of fundraising for me.
My target market include cooperatives across the country, Zambian government and republic of Congo.
Small scale farmers and large scale will find it easy to buy fertilizer at a lower cost than buying unhealthy plant fertilizer at a higher cost. It will also give them chance to make more profit than when they use chemical fertilizer.
On the environment, human fertilizer has the capacity to reduce acidity in the soil and helps to maintain good soil texture. It will also reduce chronical diseases coursed by food.

> Technical Feasibility

My plan begins with exposing my self to companies which are turning human manure into commercial fertilizer and  renewable energy. Companies such as safe life and sanagy in Kenya and India.
After exposure I intend to build composters and make rented toilets around the cities women and youths will be in charge of. Receiving toilet fees so that they can have a source of income but they have to pay rent to my company. My Frontline staff will be collecting human west from the toilets and  plant West's from markets to the site. 
The plant West's will first be crashed for easy composting.
After 21 days of composting, the sample will be taken to the laboratory for  measuring the amount of plant nutrients available before packing.
The first year will be characterised by mass advantisement in demo gardens and open 
maize fields to convince  customers that the fertilizer is the best on the market.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will reduce cost of production for their farming business hence enabling them to make more profit. It will help them to maintain health farms in terms of acidity reduction and and good soil texture. It will reduce diseases caused by contaminations in market places  and ground water when supoted at a political level.
