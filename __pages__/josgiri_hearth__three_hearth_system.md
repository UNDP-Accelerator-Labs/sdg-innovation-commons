Profile: The innovator is from Idukki district of Kerala. 

Purpose: The Josgiri hearth is an affordable hearth system developed by the innovator. Severe firewood scarcity in the region made him think of innovation like this and hence he named it as Josgiri hearth. The heat generated by burning firewood in a single hearth is utilized for cooking in three hearths. 

Technical details: According to the innovator, the first hearth beneath which the firewood is burned can be used for boiling the food. The second hearth for cooking without spilling over and the third one for drying water and keeping the food warm. The hearth is made up of cast iron, bricks and tiles. Grill and air are provided beneath the main hearth and a smoke pipe is attached to the third hearth. The three hearths interconnected with a passage for transmitting the heat/fire. 

Benefits: The hearth consumes only half the firewood compared to conventional hearths and cooks faster than the gas stove. He also claims that the utensils used for cooking or the kitchen is not stained and as heat is not transferred to the front end of the hearth and the sickness caused due to heat and smoke are completely avoided.
