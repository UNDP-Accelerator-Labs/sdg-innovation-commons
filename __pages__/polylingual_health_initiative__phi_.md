> Title of the innovation

Polylingual Health Initiative (PHI)

> Brief description of the innovation

From time immemorial, Africans have learnt health courses and presented health talk matters to the community mostly in the country's official language to serve the people and the communities who often don't even fully understand that official language. Access to healthcare services and health information is scanty to millions of people who desperately need it owing to "linguistic barriers."

Today, "research has shown that patients with linguistics barriers are likely to avoid health providers." But, if healthcare providers would make a language shift as suggested by PHI where they will need to communicate and sensitize the public all vital health matters through local languages by various outreach programs, radios, television, social media, etc, I believe people would be more healthier and empowered by the health message more than ever before as such an initiative eliminates linguistics barriers.

Interestingly, this initiative can be easily be applied to all countries provided resources permits.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will be donor dependent. It's social impact can be extremely overwhelming provided funding is adequate.
This innovation can have an indirectly profound impact on the environment. When people are empowered with health information, we will have health communities, who will be health enough to add value to the environment through many ways such as but not limited to productivity and key stakeholders to achieve various SDGs.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is being designed in such a manner that it allows transmission of multiple health languages and requires people of various professions to come on board. PHI's impregnation plan is still being crafted by experts and it will be user friendly and easier to be implemented in any country.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Definitely, Polylingual Health Initiative (PHI) will greatly improve and change the lives of thousands of people across the globe by making useful health information widely available in a language that is easily understood by nearly everyone. It has been said that "a competent team with incompetent communication skills makes an incompetent team."

For a long time, we as health care providers thought we were competent enough by acquiring the high level health education meanwhile the use of multiple languages to instill the knowledge that we have to the public was neglected. The PHI innovation can potentially bring a new light of health to every corner of the world if only it is supported by all stakeholders. 

Not only will PHI initiative change people's lives healthwise, it will also provide jobs thousands of people who have the skills but have no one to serve and, if jobs are provided, they will earn a livelihood that will eventually help them provide for their families' basic needs through it.
