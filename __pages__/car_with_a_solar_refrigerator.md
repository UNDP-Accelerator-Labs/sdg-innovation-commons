Nowadays, the cultivation of berry gardens (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries) is very popular in Georgia. Berries are mostly harvested in the hot season, and due to high temperatures, they quickly develop and begin to rot if cooling measures are not taken very quickly. In Georgia, the cold chain is not developed in such a way that the picked berries can be delivered to the quick cooling refrigerator in the desired time. By introducing the refrigerator cars developed using our concept for the berry gardens, our project offers a solution to this issue. In our hybrid concept, the required energy for cooling is obtained from solar panels mounted on the vehicle. The system also has accumulators that can be charged from the network. Using our system, farmers will solve the following problems: - The harvested berry immediately enters the cold room, and no time is wasted - We can bring the product directly to the markets by car, and it no longer needs to be transferred to another transport;  - The lack of electricity in the garden is not a challenge anymore, the cooling system works on solar energy; - Service costs are getting cheaper  - During the night, it is possible to have it connected to the normal electricity grid and use it as a refrigerator-storage.
