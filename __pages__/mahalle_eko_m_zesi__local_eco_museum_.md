This project proposes to build an Eco-Museum in a historical and cultural setting by residents of the neighborhood, including different people (age and gender), to understand and support cultural values. This concept is not limited to a building as a classical museum, but consists of a plan associated with all the cultural and historical values of that neighborhood and the people. The main purpose of the Eco-Museum is to connect heritage, nature and the people and visitors of the neighborhood.
