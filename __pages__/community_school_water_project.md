For the first time, villagers of Kade on Koro islands now have access to clean and safe drinking water. This was all thanks to the funding donated by the EU, Rotary Pacific Water for Life Foundation, and co-financing by the Rural Maritime Development Ministry, VaiWai Natural Artesian Waters, and Latter-day Saints Charities.

Prior to the project, the villagers used sea and rain water for their washing, cooking, drinking and bathing.
