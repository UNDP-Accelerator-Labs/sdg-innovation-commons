##  Smart showers that help reduce water consumption

Students Jair García, Martín Terrazas Ortiz and Carlos Andrés Torres,  from the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) in collaboration with Código IoT, developed a prototype of a smart shower that aims to reduce water consumption. The students aim to change habits and encourage quick actions to be optimal. In this way, their project was born to analyze the interactions between individuals and non-renewable resources. In this sense, the smart shower was created. Its functions are to measure the flow of water and through the internet, the brightness of the bathroom lighting changes every 15L. In addition to that, it also has a temperature sensor that interacts with the type of light, either warm or cold, to indicate whether the temperature is harmful to the skin, and it also collects data with the intention of instantly know their consumption.
