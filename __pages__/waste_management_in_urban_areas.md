Waste Management Systems in urban areas 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that management of solid waste in urban areas is currently deficient, resulting in critical sanitation and health hazards for the affected communities. This is particularly true in host and resettlement areas in the city of Pemba, where a recent sudden population growth has occurred due to conflict and climate crisis derived migration.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The northern provinces of Mozambique, with a particular focus on Cabo Delgado, have over the last two yeara been subject to extreme populational geographic shifts, as a result of conflict and climate change driven migration. In and around the provincial capital Pemba, this has meant the sudden development of settlement villages and growth of host neighborhoods to accommodate the more than 600 000 internally displaced people. This has severely impacted an already deficient waste management and sanitation plan. The increase in the number of residents, combined with the lack of waste management capacity and education, have resulted in solid waste being consistently disposed of in public areas and in neighborhood rainwater drainage networks. While the Municipality at times, and with the support of development agencies, implements cleaning campaigns in the affected neighborhoods, these are often palliative solutions that lack long term sustainability. Similarly, while the local Municipality and Academia have recognized that the 3R for Reduction, Reuse, and Recycling have environmental, economic, and social advantages, they have to date been unable to design and implement a sustainable waste management strategy around these 3 pillars.

This combination of factors results in urban neighborhoods and resettlement villages were sanitation and health issues are abundant and recurrent. In addition, the structural integrity of theses areas is also compromised with flooding, compromised accessibility, erosion and infrastructural damage due to accumulation of waste also becoming common features.

During a recent visit to Paquitequete, one of the largest and most densified neighborhoods in the city of Pemba, we were able to observe:

· how central public spaces have been taken over by open air waste disposal sites.

· how water drainage channels have been blocked by solid waste, leading to localized flooding.

· how the growing local community has resorted to using open public spaces as ablutions facilities.

· how following global trends, small pockets of recycling groups are beginning to appear within the city but are currently without access to larger recycling and upcycling infrastructures.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab was able to ascertain that while the impacted areas have seen many ‘Cleaning Initiatives’ over the years, they have always failed to drive any long lasting impact. In conversations with local authorities, lack of community ownership and participation was identified as a key reason for this. The accelerator lab proposes that a blended methodology should be adopted, using ethnographic techniques to better observe the patterns of behavior, values, and areas of potential change ​​present in this community. This would lead to co-creation of solutions, including survey of solutions with community input and design, which will ultimately allow us to ground and drive community ownership of any proposed strategies.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Accelerator Lab aims to explore ways of creating an efficient waste management system in urban areas.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can solid waste management processes be improved in urban host and resettlement communities originated from conflict and climate crisis situations?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

· Community asset mapping: mapping the actors in the waste recycling value chain, from waste collectors, to resellers, buyers, recyclers and exporters

· Behavioral insight: through structured tracking and interview processes with the goal of understanding the environment and observe contextual details that can influence a person’s behavior and motivations. 

· Participatory design: with the goal of doing a more interactive and dynamic situation analysis using geo-referencing tools, the dream map is used in planning and social transformation being based on participatory action research and local development

· Solutions Mapping: bringing together a group of people from the community to the same level of awareness related to the existent problems and the relevant solutions, in order to ascertain if solutions and existing ecosystem align.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

They will give us behavioral insights which should allow us to design economically and socially sustainable solutions, with strong community ownership and participation.  This is directly opposed to waste management strategies used to date, which are top down, and often do not account for the impact of human behavior.
## Learning questions
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The issue of waste management affects both established and new neighborhoods throughout the country, and as such, all local municipalities would benefit from a proven strategy to address this complex sanitation problem. In addition, the Ministry of Health would also benefit, as some of the most prolific health issues in the country are a result of poor sanitation (ie. Cholera & diarrhea).
