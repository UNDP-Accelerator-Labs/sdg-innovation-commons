## What is the challenge? 

Inadequate waste management and energy access are two major challenges in rural areas across Bangladesh. 
## What is the solution? How does the solution work?

BioShikha Biogas, developed by Waste Bangladesh, converts organic waste into clean and renewable biogas, providing affordable and sustainable cooking fuel for rural smallholders. An inclusive financing mechanism allows farmers to avail BioShikha. These digesters convert organic waste, such as livestock manure and crop residues, into biogas, a clean and renewable cooking fuel.

This addresses the environmental impact of improper waste disposal while providing an essential energy source, reducing dependence on traditional, often environmentally harmful, cooking methods. It helps foster environmental sustainability, improve rural livelihoods, and promote inclusive economic development in communities that face challenges related to waste, energy, and economic resources.

BioShikha Biogas uses unique, easily installable and low-maintenance digesters compared to traditional brick-and-mortar options.

Inclusive financing: Microloans and pay-as-you-go schemes make biogas solutions accessible to low-income families, unlike typical financing options.

Community focus: BioShikha Biogas empowers communities through training and support, fostering ownership and long-term success beyond simply installing digesters.
