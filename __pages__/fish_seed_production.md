> Title of the innovation

Fish seed production

> Brief description of the innovation

The focus is on providing sex reversed fish seed  of tilapia for grow-out enterprise.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It is viable in that Zambia currently imports 127,000 tons of fishery products of its total demand of 140,000 tons. The deficit has been attributed to a number of factors but among them is quantifiable quality fish. The viability of the also depends on the increase in growth rate of 3.3%. 
The main target group shall be the cooperatives, who shall trained, provided with extension services and to be out-grower thus increasing on both capacity building and revenue generation.
This innovation will aid high level of engagement in aquaculture practices including supply chain which reduce the burden on fisheries resources overexploitation thus allowing for build up of natural resources. Secondly, integration of water resources with other agro-production sectors such as horticulture shall be practiced thus ensuring water conservation.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation design is such that, it shall constitute mostly of pond infrastructure for purpose of parent stock conditioning, breeding, egg collection and hatching, postnatal treatment of fry, fingerling raising and conditioning and lastly supply. The is no prototype yet as the project is under construction.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Job creation is assured through direct employment for fingerling producers and indirect through capacity building on out-grower scheme of cooperatives thus empowering a community. 
The innovation with regard to market focuses on food security with the production of a cheaper quality protein which is easily highly marketable in the food supply chain.
