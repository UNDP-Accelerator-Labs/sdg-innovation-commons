In Ecuador, as in other parts of the world, once the harvest is done, the rice straw is left in the field and weeks later, when it is dry, it is burned, causing high CO2 emissions. It is a problem for the farmers, neighbors when the burning is carried out, for the environment and society. Rice staw is a good insulating and Yes Innovation explored the fibers for bioconstruction, creating panels for construction. Like all natural fibers, they have a positive behavior against humidity, they receive it and evacuate it easily, which glass wool does not support. Also, this biomaterial is resistant to fungi and small animals, because it is a fiber that has a lot of silicon, it is very hard, so it is not very pleasant for small mice or for fungi. In addition to this, compaction means that it does not catch fire quickly. It is like wood, which takes a long time to burn, and finally, it is recycable.

They ranked 21st among the 500 best in the Green Latin America Awards 2019 and, in addition, the Roi Baudouin Foundation of Belgium agreed to support the project and will finance a good part of the development. Also, they won the environmental distinction of the municipality of Quito last year.
