## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Addressing economic drivers of insecurity and conflict in Benue through interventions in the agriculture value chain.  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that actionable insights are required to address economic drivers of insecurity and conflict in Benue. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Integrated Peacebuilding and Stabilisation Nigeria team is working in Benue, where sporadic conflict between farming and herding communities has escalated in the last decade. This is a multi-dimensional issue with many drivers, where the conflict is over access to and control of grazing land. The herders are typically nomadic persons of Fulani extraction, while the landed communities are of varied indigenous Benue tribes. In 2017 the State Government promulgated an Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranching Law in response to the situation. Similar laws have been passed by other State Governors as well, as these conflict cuts across several states in the country. Benue State is also know as the 'Food Basket' of the country. The conflict has significantly impacted local food production systems, disrupting livelihoods, causing loss of lives and displacing entire communities. Herding communities cannot graze openly in the State and fines are now imposed for persons who do not abide by the 2017 Law. These disruptions have also impacted food security in the country and supply chains within the region. The impacts of these are keenly felt due to rising inflation and worsening economic conditions in the rest of the country.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab will use its service lines to surface insights from affected communities, which will inform program and policy interventions. We will engage in value chain and solutions mapping within affected communities to identify working local solutions that can be scaled up. The Lab services lines are being deployed to support a Program team that is working in this space and give fast feedback for additional interventions. It is worth investing resources to this challenges to contribute to alleviating the hardships caused by the conflict and look into solutions that can engage farmer and herder communities and promote peaceful co-existence between them.
