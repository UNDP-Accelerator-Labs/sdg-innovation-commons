South Farmers Company Ltd, is an industrial scale hatchery. During the war his chicken farms were destroyed so he developed an innovative scheme where he sells chicks to his clients and utilizes his wide network of customers for ready chicken to offer a guaranteed buyback scheme at a price which guarantees a decent profit for the rarer as well as for his business.
