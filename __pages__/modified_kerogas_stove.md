Profile  Innovator Mr  Sarfudiin Amanudiin Kazi is from Jalgaon district of Maharastra. Purpose   Mr Kazi lives in a remote area where people use the stove for their cooking purposes. To make the use of stove  easier he has developed a modified stove.  Technical details  It comprises a tank for kerosene oil and a burner. The tank is connected to the burner of the stove through a transmission pipe being passed over the burner. A pump is provided with tank for creating air pressure into the tank. The stove has to be pumped to produce the appropriate pressure such that appropriate pressure is generated and the fuel from the tank is transferred to the transmission pipe. Simultaneously, the fuel transmission pipe is heated with an external source which converts the forced fuel into gas. Once the fuel is converted into gas, the external heating element is taken away and gas is ignited.  Performance Innovator claims, the stove can produce the flame for 8 hours with the help of kerosene. Benefits It is smokeless and noiseless.
