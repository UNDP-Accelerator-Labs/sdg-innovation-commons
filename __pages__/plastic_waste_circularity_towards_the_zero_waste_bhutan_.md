## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Plastic waste circularity towards the Zero Waste Bhutan. 


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.

How to bring circularity to the plastic waste by scaling up effort through private sector partnership. 

Making use of the waste segregation behavior experimentation report of the Accelerator lab. 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Coca Cola Foundation based in India reached out to Accelerator Lab to explore partnership in the PET waste circularity in 2022. Learning from the other COs particularly Bangladesh and Maldives, senior management tested a partnership drive together with accelerator lab to access this opportunity. Lead by accelerator lab, the private sector due diligence is under progress. we would like to bring in $250,000 for the plastic circularity efforts.
