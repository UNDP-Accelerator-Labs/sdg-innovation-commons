Throughout his 20 years of work, Mr. Abdulkadir's denial has recycled tones and tones of used oil. Mr. Abdulkadir has been creating handwashing soap using reclaimed vegetable oil. He collects the oil from Aleppo households, restaurants, and fast food shops and stores collected oil in his little workshop located on the outskirt of the city. After a sufficient amount is collected, Mr. Abdulkadir filters the oil and then mixes it with lye and some essential oils to give it a good smell.  The process of turning grease is somehow used to be considered common knowledge especially among housewives, who used to collect their used oil and turn to turn it into soap once there is a sufficient amount. However, people started to forget about this skill because for a while it was cheaper and more time-saving to buy the soap from the market than making it at home.    In addition to it is being a good source of income, turning oil to soap considered to be a very eco-friendly practice that protects drinking water from being polluted with grease as every 1 liter of oil can polluted 1000 liter of freshwater.
