> Title of the innovation

Book-It E-tutor

> Brief description of the innovation

Our system is a web-based application that provides on demand online learning and exam preparation courses and resources for improved learning and performance outcomes. The application is linked to a teaching aid system that promotes blended learning by automating classroom tasks. The system provides multiple delivery channels to send learning content and manage students remotely. 
The system enables users access courses in all subjects such as mathematics, science, English, technology and entrepreneurship. The system is structured as follows
Course &amp; course outlines: Each subject will have a detailed introduction, topics covered and learning objectives. Each topic will be presented in chapters consisting of videos, notes, explanations, examples and worksheets. Students enrol into courses they choose ranging from math, science, technology etc. and begin to learn remotely at their own pace  
Quizzes: Mandatory assignments and quizzes will be attempted after each chapter before a student progresses to the next topic. These assessments will be objective, true or false and fill in the blank format. Students will attempt tests at the end of each topic to highlight if the student has assimilated the information before they proceed.
Videos: tutorial videos for each topic presented by qualified teachers explaining each topic in detail.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our system will be access on a subscription-based model. Students will pay a fee each term to access the courses. 
Our initial target is secondary school pupils with a focus on students in exam classes. For easier implementation Book-It has engaged several schools who we intend to partner with in deploying the system. 
The partnering schools will be leading the content creation and offer the system to their students as an added service to which profits will be shared. 
The product will have free courses that will use to attract students. Our early adopters will be private school going pupils who come from families with more disposable income.  
Winning this prize will help us create more content and expand to other provinces and partner with more schools. 
Environment: Paper manufacturing is the 3rd largest user of fossil fuels worldwide. Cutting the use of paper would prevent a great amount of greenhouse gas emission and save trees. Our platform students to stay at home and learn with comfort while avoiding wear-and-tear on vehicles and local roads. In addition, students can avoid using cars which can help reduce fossil fuel use and lessen detrimental effects on the environment

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed on interoperability functionalities that will enable it to work smoothly to integrate with other systems, the security is built on secure signature certificates that will help protect the users and the system from most online cyber-attacks it can be accessed by anyone from anywhere using any device be it a laptop or mobile device very responsive and user friendly. It is a web-based application accessed on any web browser and device.
A fully functional prototype of the innovation exists that is running live on the internet for demo tests and can be configured to be accessed offline within a network. The system only has two test courses and 3 instructors on it. The system will be fully launched by December in preparation for 2022 academic calendar. 
The system will be launched in a lean and easily scalable way. We will partner with two high schools who will be the main content creators and resource providers. The courses will be uploaded on the system and the schools will offer them firstly to their students who will be our early adopters. Revenue will be shared by us and the content creators.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Access to learning material away from a learning facility is a major problem for many students. Remote learning is one significant service that our innovation will provide directly to students therefore this will ensure continued learning away from learning facilities, and in the midst of the Covid pandemic where physical classroom attendance has been interrupted and put on hold, our learning system supports continued learning which is also interactive .it gives students access to learning material and tutors anywhere at any time. 
The fact the system is accessible from anywhere and literally anytime it also gives students flexibility to participate in various personal activities. Our system is also providing a platform that can encourage tutors and learning content providers to grow their business by using our system to provide tutorials to their student or members. 
The other significant contribution that our system is making to our society is enabling young girls, women and youth who have stopped going to school because of teenage pregnancy, motherhood(housewives) and lack of adequate finance to complete their education respectively to continue leaning through this platform that has an affordable learning services and also have access to relevant learning content and support from various tutors. Since our system is provides access to virtual learning it also helps reduce the spread of the covid-19 virus because learning will be done virtually and requires non-physical human to human interaction and crowding which puts students and their families at risk.
