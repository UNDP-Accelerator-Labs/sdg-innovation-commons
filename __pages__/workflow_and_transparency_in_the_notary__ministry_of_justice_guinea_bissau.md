## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We would like to know how a package of co-created solutions can improve workflow, accessibility and quality of service delivery in the Notary, Ministry of Justice. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF... a co-created package of solutions that address the needs of staff and users is implemented, THEN... the accessibility, workflow and quality of service delivery will improve. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test this hypothesis, the following methodology will be used:  

1. Baseline assessment:  

a) the time required to process documents (perception survey) 

b) the level of staff satisfaction with the workflow process (perception survey) 

c) the level of users satisfaction with the workflow process (perception survey) 

d) Number of documents processed per day  

e) User navigation in the building (observation)  

 

2. Identify bottlenecks 

During the baseline assessment of the current workflow processes at the Notary a perception survey was carried out with staff and users. Following bottlenecks and areas for improvement were discovered: 

a) Service journey

-The Notary is a simple service, but access is difficult

-There is a clear need for guidance and orientation.

 

b) Training & Capacity 

 - Many staff don’t have the right education and cannot pass clear information, there is a need for capacity building and basic training with a focus on the Notary and its objectives. 

 

c) Informal Structures 

 - The youth (“ Assinantes”) and the security guards have a small role with a big impact, they are the first encounter of the users when arriving at the Ministry. It is difficult for the youth and security to pass information as they don´t have the right education or training. Additionally, the youth work together with the guards to create a VIP line. Users happily pay the youth 1000 XOF to leave the process with the youth, go on with their life and pick up the document at the end of the day. The problem is that the youth sometimes provide false documents. 

 

 

3. Develop a new workflow process: Based on the findings from the baseline assessment, a new workflow has been designed and solutions co-created together with staff and users of the Ministry, to optimize and reduce the time required for each step in the process: 

 

4. Test the new workflow process: The next step will be to test the new workflow process during four weeks with users and staff members at the Notary, Ministry of Justice. Feedback will be gathered from the General Director and staff during the test to refine the solutions. 

 

5. Endline survey: The final step is to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the new workflow process by comparing: 

 

a) the time required to process documents (perception survey) 

b) the level of staff satisfaction with the workflow process (perception survey) 

c) the level of user satisfaction with the workflow process (perception survey) 

d) Number of documents processed per day 

e) User navigation in the building (observation) 

 *Any necessary adjustments should be made based on the findings from the evaluation.  

 

Assumptions: 

Co-creating solutions with Notary staff, users, and other stakeholders will ensure that the solutions are relevant and responsive to the needs of all parties, leading to greater buy-in and sustainability. 

Implementing the co-created solutions in the respective categories, including the service journey, training & capacity, and physical space, will create a more efficient and effective Notary system that provides high-quality service delivery. 

The co-created solutions will lead to reduced waiting times, clearer guidance and orientation for users, and increased capacity and professionalism among Notary staff. 

Providing a more comfortable physical space with basic amenities will create a more conducive environment for staff and users, leading to increased productivity and satisfaction. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1. Individual perception of users and staff in the Notary, Ministry of Justice

2. Observation of User navigation

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time Allocation from team: 6 months 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The hypothesis was proven. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The number of survey participants were very low creating limitations in our study. I would have liked to have reached at least 40 samples from the pre/post survey with users to make the study statistically valuable.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

9.676.800 XOF = 16.060 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We hope to scale this activity nationwide as the General Director of the Civil Registry has shown interest in continuing the collaboration.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We hope to scale this activity nationwide as the General Director of the Civil Registry has shown interest in continuing the collaboration with the same partners. There has recently been a shift in the Government with a new Minister of Justice, we are waiting to pitch the results to see if we can get the formal approval to take the experiment to scale.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

• There is a need to invest more in anti-corruption as informal structures are in place.

• There is a continuous need for staff trainings and capacity building to ensure a quality service delivery. The trainings provided made the staff feel valued.

• Co-creating solutions with staff, users, and other stakeholders can ensure that the solutions are relevant and responsive to the needs of all parties, leading to greater buy-in and sustainability.

• Implementing co-created solutions in the respective categories, created a more efficient and effective Notary system that provides higher-quality service delivery.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Time constraints: Legeslative elections slowed down the process and it is still not clear if the same team will stay in the Ministry of Justice.Difficulties in operating UN proceedures ex form of contract of our partners and data collection team, delays in payments.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Governance Cluster as the results are connects to their mandate and current portfolio.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Ministry of Justice as is the results aligns with their ongoing work and objectives.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We adjusted the length of the experiments from 2 weeks to 6 weeks. We also iterate the design of the logo/ branding developed for the Ministry as well as the size of the building signage. Aditionnally we added a round of data collection as we discovered that the questions were not fully understood by the interviewer nor the interviewees.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Take time to design the way the data collection will be done to make sure you get the data needed for a strong result, and invest time in the data collection team to make sure they fully understand the survey questions.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Co-creating solutions and validate their efficiency could easily be replicated in ex. SDG3 Good Health and Wellbeing

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

As always the sense and explore phase highly influenced this experiments, the test was based on the findings from previous phases. I would have liked to have worked closer to my colleagues if time allowed us, unfortunatley we split 

> What surprised you?

The openness and engagement of the partners, especially the Ministry of Justice
