Fuel Supply Solution

> Brief description of the innovation

Supply of fuel in Zambia a mix of the refinery 45% and 55% finished product procured via government tender. With a number of oil marketing companies operating in the country, Zambia has an opportunity to make the fuel supply chain , efficient,  cost reflective and reactive to market conditions.  Briefly the following points can be considered 
1. Energy regulation board must set pump prices based on international market parameters i.e. exchange rate and international cost of product . 
2. Oil marketing companies to import fuel for there inventory and sale at ERB set prices. Any additional profits made by the OMC to be shared with ERB as part of strategic reserve funds. 
3. Price reviews to be done every 30days if need be , this will ensure the international cost of product is reflected locally in real time
4 . TAZAMA depots to operate on hospitality basis as well as strategic storage for government.  Supply margins declared by the OMC'S to be used to build stock for the government.  
5. INDENI refinery to be upgraded to enable it process raw crude oil. The upgrade is a huge capital outlay and therefore,  focusing on HFO, Diesel and LPG which the refinery would sell for a profit would enable them build the required capital or indeed find a financing partner 
6. Transportation of petroleum products to be.done by OMC's themselves who will contract 50% Zambia transporters and not unions. We do not have many trucks in Zambia and maybe some investors can come.into the sector
