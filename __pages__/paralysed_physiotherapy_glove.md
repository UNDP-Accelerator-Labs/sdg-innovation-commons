Paralysed Physiotherapy glove is a glove designed to help paralysed patients to conduct physiotherapy activities in a more organised manner. The glove is capable of performing ball-grasping movement, via training of nerve movement through controlled action using a remote control button that is placed on the glove. 
Patients can also choose to do physiotherapy on one or all of the fingers of choice.
