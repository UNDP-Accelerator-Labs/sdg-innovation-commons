Local entrepreneur has partnered with greenscience.ca to use worms (vermiculture) to convert food waste and biodegradable industrial waste such as cardboard and paper into fertilizer. The fertilizer consists of worm waste excreted as the worms eat through the compost. This will be sold locally as an alternative to imported fertilizer which can help to regenerate soil. The waste will be brought to a central location in Tortola for processing and will start with hotel and restaurant food waste and then scale up to include household and yard waste.
