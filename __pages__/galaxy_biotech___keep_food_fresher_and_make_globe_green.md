Plastic Pollution Challenge: Viet Nam is one of the largest fresh fruit and vegetable exporters in the world. However, agricultural products have low value due to a lack of effective post-harvest preservation, leading to 50% product loss. At the same time, the popular usage of plastic bags in the preservation process in transportation contributes to the problem of plastic pollution.

Solution: In July, 2020, GALAXY BIOTECH launched the BREATHABLE BIOBAG, a starch-based bag made from industrial cassava (tapioca) starch – a popular local species that grows well in harsh soil in the Highland and South-East regions of Viet Nam. The bag provides a solution for food preservation, while being biodegradable.

Innovation: The BREATHABLE BIOBAG tackles two urgent issues, including plastic pollution and food waste. Moreover, our solution also helps increase Viet Nam’s agricultural product  – which is cassava, thus adding incomes for poor farmers. We have applied both biotechnology and nanotechnology to develop 4 types of eco-friendly food preserver bags, targeting the bio-packaging industry. We are innovating with bags that can keep vegetables, fruits, meat and fish fresher and protect them from bacteria and viruses. We have also developed a methodology to calculate the CO2 emissions  to find ways to minimize pollution. Awards include:
