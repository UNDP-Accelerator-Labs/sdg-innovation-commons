## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

-In the War exposed district that we explored for the data recovery, no data regulation and protection protocols had been in place.
-Data acquisation relied on hard copy records, therefore data need to be managed on electronic copies and scanning devices
-Simple microsoft based data recording in a district level central database could have saved the physically damaged, burnt, and lost documentations in hard copies.
-ICT trained focal person is required in different sections of the districts administration





> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The learning insights and findings, and recomendations of the exploratory research has been handed over to the UNDP's livelihood recovery project, therefore it will be used for the project planning as part of the peace support program of the uNDP

> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

On the major data loss, the district
administrators have been the key sources of information, the entire work also
requires physical observation, therefore, to understand the extent of data loss. Experts have also been interviewed to assess their capacity and understanding of data management. Therefore, the data acquisition approaches have been useful
in understanding what has been lost, why the data have been lost, are there
possibilities for data recovery.
## Partners

> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

The mentioned government office is collaborating
with the UNDP for the livelihood recovery project in the Northern Ethiopia war
affected areas. The data element has been missing among the other in-kind and
financial supports offered by the UNDP, while data is key source of the government
business continuity. Therefore, the accelerator lab has filled this gap by
exploring the extent, and types of data losses and possible recommendations for
a resilient data management system.
