## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Ramiz Uddin

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

5 January 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

How to utilise Digitalization and accessible Data Innovation for transforming the informal economy by creating informal employment in Bangladesh.

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Unemployment and Informal Economy

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

LQ1: How digitalization and data intelligence can contribute to data for decision making in informal business?
LQ2: How informal workers can be benefitted from digitalization of informal business?
LQ3: How to map good practices of digitalization and data innovation in the informal sector?
LQ4: How data innovation on informality can attract the attention of policy makers to contribute to the vulnerabilities of informal sectors and employment based on data intelligence?
LQ5: What is the trend of digitization, digitalization, data innovations and e-Commerce in Bangladesh in the informal business?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector
- Private Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

1. Ministry of Labour and Employment; 2. National NGO; 3. Local Associations; 4. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics; 5. ILO; 6. National Data Center; 7. Transport Owners' Association; 8. Bangladesh National University. 9. Bangladesh Tourism Board; 10. a2i Programme of Bangladesh Government. 11. Industry Members; 12. Business Associations
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning intents of the activity are to know: 1. What is the understanding among different stakeholders about the situation of informality in Bangladesh? 2. How informal workers can be benefitted from digitalization of informal business? 3. How a scale-up program would gradually benefit the existing system by adjusting the digital data tools and innovation based on learning experiences in the informal economy?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF digitalization and data intelligence can be scaled up, THEN the informal workers will be financially benefited through using digital financial tools; H2: IF good practices of digitalization and data innovation can be mapped and implemented, THEN it will create more income opportunities as well as increase the income of the informal workers; H3: IF data innovation on informality can be utilised based on data intelligence, THEN it will attract the attention of policy makers to contribute to the vulnerabilities of informal sectors and employment; H4: IF Digitalization and the use of data innovation and data intelligence can be properly managed, THEN it will meet the needs of the sectoral employment-including digital sensemaking, online job creation, online service delivery etc.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely
- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Run full package of experimentation, data collection, monitoring and Evaluation of the indicators and conduction of research.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1. Collective group of informal business owners and informal workers at different location in Bangladesh; 2. Recommendations on actions and processes from stakeholders; 3. Different module and products of data innovation in Informality for policy.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Simple random sampling for pilot survey using KoboToolbox by physical or online one-to-one interview. For nation-wide survey, cluster random sampling might be applied.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

January to December 2022

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
