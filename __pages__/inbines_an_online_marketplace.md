Inbines is an online marketplace. Meaning seller's or people selling products can open an online store (inbines.com/storename). After which, customers can purchase products at the comfort of there home.the website is currently only available in Zambia this means only Zambian stores can sign up for now.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In contrast, with income we will only get 10% of the profit for each product sold by a business/person.
As a marketplace inbines, will give businesspeople an opportunity to expand there businesses. Because, not only will they be limited to a specific location where the physical store is found but will even gain online presence. Meaning people who can't afford to access the physical store can do it online this means more customers for the business. 
Therefore, our target market is businesses that offer products ranging from electronics, clothes, furniture, groceries etc. We will also provide more opportunity to businesses that offer delivery because the products being purchased on the site will have to be delivered.
In addition, concerns about the environment will only benefit people in reduced gathering therefore, reducing our current situation the Covid-19. Because, people will be able to shop from there favourite stores online reducing people in stores and communities.

> Technical Feasibility

Inbines is designed to offer people(business es) more accessibility to there market by having online presence. 
Many businesses use social media platforms to offer "online shopping", but social media is a place for socialization (fun) people will rarely use those platforms for business. Furthermore, most people get distractions when using social media, this is just not bad for business but also the person leading the business. How many times will the business owner reply to massages, how many massages are they missing, all these different factors. 
Our services will eliminate all those problems first of all it will provide businesses a centre of attention, if someone wants to buy something they will visit the online store and buy products without facing distractions. Thereafter, the business will receive a mail and will deliver the product. The only difficult we will face is having a to find a reliable delivery service and advertising to business.
To implement our services, we plan on reaching out to businesses that are starting to help them grow because, of all the advantages that come with using an online store are a lot. Then after we move on to large businesses because we will have gotten some recognition.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Inbines can help businesses expand. the business can even further expand if we start to go outside Zambia. For the lives of people it means less movement. products can be purchased from home. Many people who looked for a chance to start a business can start one because with an online store you don't have to have a physical store, only the products. 
With our current market inbines can be very helpful because, business have lost sales due to the pandemic. But if they can start selling online people can still buy from them even during this period of time. Businesses can still make money and customers can stay safe from the virus being passed to them. Our economy can still grow.
