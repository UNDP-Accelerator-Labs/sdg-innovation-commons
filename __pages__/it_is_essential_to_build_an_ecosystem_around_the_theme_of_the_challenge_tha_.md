## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1- Was essential to build an ecosystem around agriculture and climate change  2- The Sense phase was the first step to defining opportunities of our challenges and also to identify all the preview context around it 3-  The use of unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( Drones)is a solution that allow us to act quickly, timely and efficiently on reforestation and climate change 4-  This solution allows to have a better management of human and material resources, which are often scarce or consume a lot of time gathering all the necessary and indispensable in a timely manner 5- 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

It was reaally difficult to introduce the learns from the sense cycle into the procurement process of acquisition

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

They are the basic strategy for selecting the best data type is to select the smallest data type that matches the kind of data you have and that allows for all the feasible values of your data.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Allows to act quickly, timely and efficiently; allows us to have a better management of human and material resources, which are often scarce or consume a lot of time gathering all the necessary and indispensable in a timely manner.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In addition to the use of drones, the production of seed balls was  an innovation by local women from the community of Serra Malagueta. The production was supported by the Tarrafal Women's Ceramics Cooperative; there was also previous work mapping the localities that would be covered by the innovative initiative. There was a whole preparation and choice of soil where the seeds would be released, with the communities support.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The young innovator Erico Pinheiro who created the  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Drones) as a agriculture and reforestation solution is a university teacher from UNICV, and also coordinator of " Casa da Ciência" "Science House" from MINDELO, Cabo Verde.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked we PrimeBotics, Lda. They produced the Drones.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Green Islands project, is in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment's REFLOR-CV project. They provide the forage seeds; and made the contact with the local communities to produce the seed balls, and the preparation and choice of soil where the seeds was release,  

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The young innovator, who brought all the design and the technological solution.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

 The FAO who funded the REFLOR/project, our main partner.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

All the innovation methods and so on  allows to act quickly, timely and efficiently, also to have a better management of human and material resources, which are often scarce or consume a lot of time gathering all the necessary and indispensable in a timely manner.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
