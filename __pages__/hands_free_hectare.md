> Description of the solution

Harper Adams University engineering staff, along with precision farming specialist Precision Decisions Ltd, set up a‚Äãutomated machines growing the first arable crop remotely, without operators in the driving seats or agronomists on the ground. ‚ÄòHands Free Hectare‚Äô (HFHa) created autonomous machines out of agricultural vehicles bought off the general market and fitting them with an autopilot system intended for flying drones before programming them with open source software. The budget of less that ¬£200,000 was funded by Precision Decisions and Innovate UK.
