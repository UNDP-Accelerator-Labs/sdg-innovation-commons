The key insights generated from this learning challenge are listed below:
1. Collaboration and partnership between local government and private sector is crucial to explore, test and scale the interventions on waste management.
2. Transformative change on the perspective of waste requires investment and enabling environment for the waste enterprises to foster.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



The intervention and idea has been kept as an open source. A total of 12 upcycled benches were handed over to the ward 1 office of Lalitpur Metropolitan City office. The intervention was taken positively and hence was later expanded to two more municipalities (4 upcycled benches at Kathmandu Metropolitan City and 5 at Chandragiri Municipality) after the coordination with the respective municipalities.
