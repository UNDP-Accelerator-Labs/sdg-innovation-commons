Recycled metal used to build a wood chipper and sifter (only the engine and blade were purchased).  Currently being used to shred and sift wood debris from the farm. Wood chippings are used for mulch and added to existing composting piles. The mulch helps with weed suppression and soil moisture retention and the compost is used as fertilizer eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers facilitating organic farming and increasing yields.
