> Description

We are an enterprise that produces, markets and promotes the proper use of seasonal fruits and medicinal plants that are abundant in our land. We make artisanal, natural ice cream based on fruits and medicinal plants, sweetened with honey and ka'a he'e, this combination makes it rich, nutritious, natural and economical and can be purchased by all people who want to consume healthy food. , we buy our ingredients from small producers in the area, both fruits, plants and honey are supplied from the area, thus promoting better economic circulation, we work with enterprising women who make jams, and we give consignment to those who want to undertake selling the products with a profit without initial investment.
