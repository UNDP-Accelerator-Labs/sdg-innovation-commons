## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Citizen Platform

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

23/10/202

> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The initiative fosters community engagement by providing tools for citizens to actively participate in the decision-making processes that affect their neighborhoods. This is directly related to Action Learning Plans that emphasize the importance of local ownership, ensuring that development initiatives are rooted in the needs and perspectives of those living in the community.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Understand how digital tools and participatory processes can improve citizen engagement in local governance.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF citizens are empowered through digital tools, THEN they will actively participate in local governance, leading to better decision-making, more inclusive policies and sustainable development outcomes. in their neighborhoods.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Before-and-after measurements: Tracking changes in citizen engagement, service delivery, and policy effectiveness before and after the implementation of the digital tools.
Inter-neighborhood comparisons: Examining differences between neighborhoods based on their level of engagement or data contributions to the platform, even if all are technically part of the experiment.
This approach ensures that the entire community benefits, aligning with the goal of inclusivity and no neighborhood left behind.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The original hypothesis, which suggested that IF citizens are empowered through the “Mi Barrio” platform, THEN they will actively participate in local governance, IS supported based on the current results. The platform has become the main tool of the municipality, with the participation of more than 15 neighborhoods and 4 submunicipalities. This indicates that citizens are using the platform to participate and the municipality is adopting it for governance, showing positive movement towards the intended goals of greater participation and better governance.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

Most Important Learning Outcomes:

Empowerment through Digital Tools: The platform successfully enabled citizens from more than 15 neighborhoods to engage with local governance, proving that digital tools can foster participation in the Bolivian context.

Community-Led Decision-Making: The experiment demonstrated that citizen data and feedback can shape municipal policies effectively, creating a closer relationship between residents and local government.

Scalability Potential: The success in multiple neighborhoods shows potential for expanding the platform to more areas.

Recommended Changes:

Expand Access: In a Bolivian context, ensuring wider internet access and digital literacy would help engage more citizens, especially in rural or underserved areas.

Localize Content Further: Tailoring content to specific regional languages or dialects could increase participation from diverse communities.

Enhanced Civic Training: Providing more robust training and support on how to use the platform could increase the depth of engagement and data quality.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Main Obstacles and Challenges:

1. Digital Divide: Limited internet access and digital literacy in some neighborhoods made it challenging to ensure widespread participation.

2. Initial Citizen Engagement: Encouraging residents to actively use the platform required significant awareness campaigns and training.

3. Technical and Resource Constraints: The development and maintenance of the platform demanded technical expertise and continuous support.

Advice for Colleagues:

1. Invest in Digital Literacy and Access: Ensure that communities have the necessary tools and training to engage with the platform.

2. Build Strong Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and leaders to foster trust and drive participation.

3. Start Small and Scale Gradually: Begin with a few neighborhoods to refine the process before expanding.
