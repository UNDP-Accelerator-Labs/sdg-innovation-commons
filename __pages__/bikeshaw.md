Bikeshaw: A new neighbourhood transport for Yangon

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

To introduce you to this innovation, I have to gave you a bit of background information.

Trishaw is a common neighbourhood transportation in Yangon, Myanmar. When you want to go to the market and carry a load of groceries, trishaw is always a first option for the city dwellers. And, Yangon never allowed motorbikes due to a controversial policy under the military regime, which has not changed under two terms of civilian government. However, under the difficult circumstances of Covid-19 restricitions, motorbikes came into picture with new form, bikeshaw!

A traditional trishaw is a tricycle, a bicycle with a carriage attached to it, but this new motorbike trishaw (which I named as bikeshaw :D ) attached a carriage to a motorbike. Those of you who know tuk tuk would wonder, what's the difference? Then, I would have to say this is Yangon's new interpretation of tuk tuk. :)

Check out the comparison of traditional trishaw and the modified bikeshaw in the below picture.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

These bikeshaws mostly serve as mobile shops during Covid 19. When people are reluctant to go out to buy their daily needs, these bikeshaws fulfil these needs by transporting the local vendors in front of your house. Instead of tedious peddling of trishaw, the bikeshaw drivers easily carry the goods and sell around or carry both a street vendor and the goods on their bikeshaws. My mornings would start with the recorded voices of these local vendors playing from their bikeshaws selling raw meat and fishes to fresh coconuts. The convenience of these bikeshaws expand the coverage of the local vendors who would usually use trishaws or carts. In return, it increases their sales and empowering them their businesses running during this difficult time of Covid-19.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Need is one of the main driver for innovation.

These bikeshaws are still in question for legality, but these serve the purpose for the people already and it would be difficult for the government to neglect it. I believe that these bikeshaws would change the policy on bikes by the local government of Yangon. Sometimes, needs prevail the rules.

While the potentials of these bikeshaws such as in the delivery services limited by utilising bicycles because motorbikes are illegals, and in solving traffic congestion, we also need to foresee the potentials of third order negative consequences.
