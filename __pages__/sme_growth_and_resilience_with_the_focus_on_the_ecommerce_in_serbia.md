SME Growth and Resilience with the focus on the eCommerce in Serbia 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in times of uncertainty and pandemic shocks, we see that the Serbian economy and society need a future-proof and resilient SMEs sector for further sustainable human and economic development in Serbia. eCommerce appears to be one of the potential solutions that can support the resilience of Serbian SMEs. We want to help Serbian businesses continue to grow and scale up by securing a legal framework for further growth in the area of eCommerce. With already established many players and stakeholders in the field of SMEs, we want to explore potential approaches, solutions, partnerships and insights that can inform SMEs portfolio design and help position UNDP in this field.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

To prepare for emerging trends in the future of work, climate change, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Serbia requires robust structural reforms and innovation. This includes fostering a reskilled and more fluid labor market, improving access to finance and the ease of doing business, and encouraging private sector-led export growth beyond domestic consumption.​​In addition, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which account for four percent of businesses but 35 percent of national employment and gross value added, should be at the forefront of such efforts. Trends like this one show us where weak points could be found, but also, give us signals where opportunities for SMEs resilience and further growth might be - eCommerce as a potential solution for business and market expansion as well as generators of additional business streams. To date, the Accelerator Lab has engaged with Deloitte and a CO team on the overall SME resilience portfolio design, as well as leading a stream of work around e-commerce as an element in the SME resilience space that has become particularly relevant with the Covid-19 crisis. Following a study on e-commerce in Serbia in the post-COVID context, the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications, requested the Lab to provide support in drafting the national strategy in this domain. Within this engagement, the Lab has produced a draft national strategy document, but also 5 concept notes describing the potential engagement of UNDP with a wider e-commerce landscape.

Lab commissioned comprehensive research on e-commerce in Serbia, related to post-COVID economic recovery, with the intention to inform programming and potential future support to the resilience of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). In exploring the post-COVID e-commerce landscape in Serbia, we used quantitative data from the official sources (e.g. National Bank of Serbia), industry (e.g. Serbian Chamber of Commerce), existing studies on e-commerce (e.g. USAID survey of 1000 Serbian companies), but also conducted a survey of around 400 Serbian e-commerce entities. A summary can be found in the published study: https://www.rs.undp.org/content/serbia/en/home/library/e-commerce-serbia-post-covid-context.html  Also, each of the concept notes for a potential UNDP engagement in the e-commerce arena, that were subsequently developed within the process of drafting the national e-commerce strategy, contain a summary of relevant quantitative data illustrating the gap/justifying the proposed intervention (available upon request, only in Serbian). We also didn’t rely only on quantitative data and desk research, but also took into account different views of the companies (obtained through quantitative research) and e-commerce users (obtained through focus groups). Finally, we explored certain issues in more detail through deep-dive conversations with selected representatives of companies. In the process of conducting research on e-commerce in the post-COVID context, we engaged 16 individuals (e-commerce users) and 21 business owners. In the process of developing the national strategy and concept notes, we engaged around 120 different stakeholders from all major groups (government, private sector, academia, civil society, international/development organizations).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Following the request from the Ministry of Trade, Tourism, and Telecommunications, we were tasked with developing the National E-commerce Strategy 2022-2024, which provided us with the opportunity to distinguish UNDP Serbia as a key player in policy development while also identifying areas of intervention in which UNDP CO and the Accelerator Lab would play a leading role. The added value of the Accelerator Lab is using systemic approaches and avoiding single-point solutions.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation - Using a collaborative approach, we want to draft the key part of the strategy in collaboration with many e-commerce stakeholders and with their feedback.  Positive deviance -  The goal of positive deviance is to identify individuals and organizations who have a different perspective on eCommerce in Serbia and abroad, and to solicit their input on our work on strategy (such as Serbian Gaming Association, Serbian Blockchain Initiative, etc.)

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Our objective is to conduct over 100 in-depth interviews with individuals and representatives of Serbia's most prominent organizations in the field of eCommerce.  Most of the existing data is based on official statistics or other quantitative sources such as reports on financial transactions by commercial banks, credit card issuers or the Central Bank. Through more in-depth research we aim to paint a much more nuanced picture of the ecosystem and its pressing issues.
