> Title of the innovation

Mixed rotation farming and rearing

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation will involve farming of different types of plants and crops and all greens and also animals such as goats, at the same farm land, in almost one to three years, there will be a rotation of crops where, each crop is grown at a different area, this will enable less demand of nutrients in the soil.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will address the economy in that people want different things to eat and rely on, it's because of this difference that people wont require to move from one place to another seeking for that kind of a product, but they will find it in there locality, growing different types of things at the same farm, enables the economy not to grow only in one area but increase diversity of the diet, and reduce the demand of people congesting the same area because of buying the staff they need which is found only in one area, rather they will find what they need in there locality, this will reduce the impact of nutrient demand in the environment and green gas emissions which results mostly from the degrading of nutrients and demand for nutrients by plants. The market are the marketeers and individuals, with export to other countries

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation will be implemented in such a way that, there will be growing of much plants at the same area to reduce on the impact of degrading the soil in a huge massive way which may contribute to climate change, we will use drones to capture the area and be able to see where our plant may be infested and where there is stress in plants hence increasing the yield per year, and the rotation of plants will enable us to reduce on the use of fertilizer which contribute to green gas emissions, and also keeping of animals such as goats and others, that will be fed by using a specific ground for them, hence also reducing degrading.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This proposal will enable the market not to rely just on a same type of a plant or crop rather this proposal promotes diversity of use of plants, people will not need to move from the place where It will be located, hence reducing transport cost, and they will find it easy to buy almost everything they need in there comfort zone.The market needs diversity of plants to survive and diet, today we have lot of people lacking some nutritional values in there lives because we rely on importing some things and growing same things at a huge area, of which if they were to be grown in zambia they would save a better purpose...
