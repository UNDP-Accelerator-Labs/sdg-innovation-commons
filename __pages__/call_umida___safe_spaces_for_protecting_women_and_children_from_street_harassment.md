## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

UNDP and other neutral organizations can play a vital role in being a kindle in mobilizing partners and community – sometimes an icebreaker and integrator is needed to mobilize the existing willingness and resources.




The monitoring of Call Umida response mechanisms generated insights on the revision training content and mechanisms (e.g., efficiency of visualized content).




The initiative would benefit from&nbsp;a dedicated communication channel and a team in charge of outreach and raising awareness.




The campaign’s inclusivity needs further improvement to be more accessible for the people with disabilities.




Call Umida initiative identified and raised other burning issues of gender-based violence in society and importance to address them.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The main problem we have faced working on the challenge was lack of competent NGOs working on the issues of gender-based violence in the country. This adds difficulties in outsourcing related local expertise and think about further phase-out of UNDP continuation and growing of the initiative.&nbsp;

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Engagement with local youth - exploring the social and individual aspects of the issue deeper

&nbsp;

Experiments - devising mechanisms and models for solutions, gathering feedback on what works and what doesn’t

&nbsp;

Social network/social media data - extended reach, demographic targeting, and privacy to gather personal experiences and stories

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Human-Centered Design - designed better partnership models and “customer experience” for the initiative

&nbsp;

Pilots - tested the ideas in a test mode to gather insights and improve

&nbsp;

Social Media Analysis - gathered insights (both scale and depth) about the issue

&nbsp;

Solutions Mapping - mapped various possible solutions and incorporate them in further iterations and expanding the initiative
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Nemolchi.uz/SukutSaqlama - Provided us with media support through their popular social media accounts. They also provided an expert support and helped in mobilizing volunteers.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

TEAM University – the university is one of our founding alliance members and participated in the program by providing safe spaces for women in girls from street harassment, as well as helped us in awareness raising

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have formal cooperation agreements with 19 partners including (preliminary interest from 60+ companies)

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the biggest groceries chains in the Country (Korzinka)

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee shops

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Universities

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pharmacy chain

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning/Coworking Centers

-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

They created 260+ safe spaces for women and girls from street harassment across the Tashkent city and other cities.

AccLab developed short questionaries for the private sector staff for self-testing after they complete the video training/guidance

AccLab developed video guidance for the private sector staff to react properly when victim of harassment come and ask for help.

Several private partners started including this guidance as their mandatory courses when they hire staff.

We conduct regular joint monitoring and “drills” to test and assess the work of the safe spaces.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Tashkent City Municipality – we are partnering with then on creating a series of murals raising awareness of gender-based violence and harassment in crowded locations of the city.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

This is the first time when UNDP Uzbekistan had engaged such a big community of different private companies, signed letters of intents and MoUs for the partnership. In fact, UNDP has acted as a locomotive of a social partnership and movement against street harassment, which even brought up the “hidden” issue into the light of social discussion and action.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

A factor of success in this initiative might have been the overlap of expertise, resources, and political positioning that each of the implementing partners brought in. Diversity and unique role of each partnership group allowed to create and functioning and viable cooperation model.&nbsp;
