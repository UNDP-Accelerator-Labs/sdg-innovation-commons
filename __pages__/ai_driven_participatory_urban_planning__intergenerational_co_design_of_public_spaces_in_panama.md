## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To understand how AI tools can enhance participatory urban planning processes, particularly in fostering increased social cohesion and generating innovative urban design solutions from diverse generational perspectives.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we use AI tools to facilitate participatory urban planning workshops, then participants from different generations will engage more effectively in the planning process, increasing social cohesion and contributing diverse and valuable insights that lead to more inclusive and innovative urban design solutions.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Conduct Intergenerational Workshops: Organize a series of workshops involving participants from different age groups, including students from the Technological University of Panama and seniors citizens from the Betania community.

Utilize AI Tools: Use AI tools, such as UrbanistAI, to render participants' urban design ideas in real-time. This will facilitate visual understanding and help bridge generational communication gaps.

Facilitate Collaborative Design Sessions: Encourage participants to co-create urban space designs, using the AI-generated visuals as a common reference point. Facilitate discussions around these designs to capture diverse perspectives and ideas.

Collect Feedback and Observations: Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback from participants about their experiences using AI in the planning process. Observe interactions to assess levels of engagement and collaboration.

Analyze Social Cohesion Indicators: Assess indicators of social cohesion, such as mutual understanding, willingness to compromise, and shared goals, before and after the workshops.

Evaluate Urban Design Solutions: Analyze the quality and inclusivity of the urban design solutions generated, considering how well they reflect the input from all age groups.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

There are some limitations regarding the extend of the capacity of the AI to adequately render local contextual elements into the renders of the public spaces, a clear expression of that was that the AI used plants that usually don't grow in Panama´s weather

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Around 2.5K which was to pay for the server capacity of UrbanistAI to render the images for the 4 workshops

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, we going to present the results of the design of the public spaces to the local government next month, for them to consider the elements into their urban planning

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

This has been brought up to the regional HDR team who has shown interest in publishing this experience into the regional Latam Human Development Report

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The experiment demonstrated that integrating AI tools into participatory urban planning can significantly enhance engagement and inclusivity across generations. We learned that AI tools like UrbanistAI not only provide immediate visual feedback, which facilitates creative discussions, but also help bridge communication gaps between younger and older participants by offering a common, tangible reference point.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacles we encountered was using the AI platform, at some moment during the workshop the rendering of images would not be timely, and also sometimes the images would come out distorted. This shows that some challenges persist when using emerging technologies. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The results of this experimental activity are valuable for multiple UNDP teams, including the national and regional Human Development Report teams, as they provide practical insights into fostering social cohesion and inclusivity through participatory urban planning. The regional Human Development Report team has already recognized the significance of this experiment, indicating that it will be included in the upcoming regional report. Additionally, teams working on governance, digital transformation, and urban development can adapt these findings to enhance participatory processes and address community-level challenges, particularly in fostering trust and collaboration across generations. The governance team has also shown interest in using it in one of their programmes. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?


Outside UNDP, several stakeholders have directly benefited from this experiment. The Technological University of Panama, our key partner, gained valuable insights and practical experience from collaborating on this initiative, which they have integrated into one of their flagship programs aimed at bridging generational gaps through knowledge sharing. Additionally, the local government of Betania benefited from the final public space designs, which incorporated the perspectives of both elderly and young residents, providing them with actionable, community-driven solutions for urban improvement. These outcomes demonstrate the experiment’s potential to foster inclusive collaboration and generate sustainable development impacts beyond UNDP.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, we did 4 workshops in total.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Test the tool first. Previous upload of pictures into the platform is recommended for faster editing process (it uses less server capacity this way).

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this experiment can be replicated in other thematic areas and SDGs, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action) for community-driven climate resilience planning or SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) for designing inclusive health infrastructure. Key considerations include adapting the methodology to the specific context, ensuring stakeholder engagement in the targeted area, providing support for technological literacy, and allocating resources for facilitation and follow-up to maintain inclusivity and effectiveness.

> What surprised you?

How much the use of technology can influence the level of engagement of youth.
