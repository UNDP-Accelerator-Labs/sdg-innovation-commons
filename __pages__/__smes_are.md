## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- mSMEs are ready to transform to digital but don't have enough resources for this; - there is a lack of coordinated strategy on the process of transformation; - there are lots of experts on digital transformation in Azerbaijan but no clear channels to communicate this knowledge effectively; - to ensure effective transformation we need more actors to be involved into the process (ecosystem players); - currently existing tools are not enough for the effective transition (lack of online payment options, access for the extra funding).

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
