> TITLE: Please provide a title for the solution you observed.

Unemployed artists take their music to the streets

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

During the pandemic it has been possible to observe bands playing music in the streets of affluent neighborhoods, given that their livelihood was severely affected due to the closure (both temporary and permanent) of the businesses who hired their services. 

> NEED: What need does this answer?

This solution answers the need for a livelihood based on the arts that can be sustained throughout crises.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Cultural activities are some of the most affected by the restrictions imposed to control COVID-19, but artists and musicians are finding ways to update their craft in response to the new conditions and people's need for connection in a time of isolation.
