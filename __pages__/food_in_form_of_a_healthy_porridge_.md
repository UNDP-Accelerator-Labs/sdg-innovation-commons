> Title of the innovation

Food in form of a healthy porridge.

> Brief description of the innovation

Bulyo porridge is a healthy porridge that is made from carefully selected ingredients such as; Rice, Soya, groundnuts and papitas seeds. The porridge is very Delicious which is more reason most people have failed to resist it. The porridge is an innovation that came up as a result of a solution to manultrion levels here in Zambia. Nationally, about 40% of children under 5 years in Zambia are stunted and that constitutes about One Million of the population according to the USAID nutritional file. Be as it may, at least 1 in 22 children die of manultrion. My innovation is a good solution in a place like Zambia and Africa at large has most people can't afford proper meals which makes this innovation a better option as it is Solid,rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber and energy.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As a company Mizhu Zhatu enterprise limited we intend to provide Jobs for the smooth running of the company through a proper structure. Though at present we have people helping on probonal basis, we would like to employ a permanent team.
We will supply our product to Super Markets such as Melissa, pick and pay Shoprite Pharmacy outlets etc. We have already secured a spot with Melissa super market to supply. 
There is  about 1 Million market size in Zambia i.e urban and rural area. Our product is likely to sell in the urban area where we are located with a market size of about 400,000. Our target market is about 15% which is 60,000.
The bulyo package with everything factored in is K45 ($2.8) per 500g. We estimate to sell 60,000 packages in our first year which will give us $168,000 minus cost of production $98,000 which will give us a net profit of $70,000 per annum.
Our major company needs are as follows;
-Machinery
- Operating space
- Raw Materals to meet the demand
- Vehicle
The machines required for operations are non pollutant and our packaging in Eco friendly.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is a healthy porridge that can be eaten by all age groups. The product has been on the market for two months and we have been supplying to family and friends who have about 95% given us positive reviews. This has assisted us with having a genuine taste of the market and genuine criticism from our customers. 
We plan on introducing more healthy flavours such as wild fruit flavor where we will add baobab fruit known for immune boosting and cinnamon flavor for adults and recovering patients.  We have the potential of supplying 5000 packages per month to local markets. We also plan to start exporting our product in the second year of our operations thats after we acquire the international trade certificate.
We are currently setting up social media handles for purposes of advertisement and interaction with our customers. We will also use famous bloggers to advertise our product before we start using television and radio notices. For disconnected methods, we will utilize announcements on personal pages and brand our company vehecles.

This innovation of a healthy blend porridge will improve nutritional levels in all age groups. The healthy porridge is loaded with healthy benefits that have been tested by Zambia bureau of standards. It is very relevant to the market as because the porridge is quite satisfying being a solid porridge and there is no need of in between meals for children as most families can't even afford. This is certainly a product that has been missing on the market. To the people we have sold to so far, the results of children putting on weight are vivid due to the nutrients being acquired in the porridge.
