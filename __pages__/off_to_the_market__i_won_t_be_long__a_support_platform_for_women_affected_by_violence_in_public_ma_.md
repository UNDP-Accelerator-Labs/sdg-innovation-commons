> Description

The initiative seeks to transform the San Antonio market in Sucre into a safe space for women who have experienced violence by creating a support platform among “caseras” (female vendors), sustained through economic ventures that leverage the market’s own potential. The program aims to reclaim the culturally female-dominated space of markets, using forums with legal and psychological specialists from feminist collectives to raise awareness on gender violence among the vendors. These forums also create a space for them to share their own experiences and build connections. The forums run alongside practical skills workshops, like embroidery and composting, inspired by the concept of 'learning by doing' from embroidery circles. The goal is for economic ventures to sustain the platform itself while supporting participants' economic independence.


The project has supported 24 vendors from the San Antonio market, who participated in gender discussions, unlearning violence, and learning the critical steps for supporting women affected by violence, all held within embroidery circles. The participating 'caseras' applied this knowledge by creating clothing for the Virgen de Guadalupe festival and the university parade, while also sharing their personal experiences with violence and their skepticism toward authorities.

In the second phase, the goal was to formalize the platform by strengthening the women’s leadership skills and establishing partnerships with feminist collectives to ensure continuous training and a referral network for legal and psychological support. This phase also included an environmental component, offering composting workshops to utilize organic waste from the market, with an eye toward generating resources to sustain the platform and support the vendors through composting modules within the market.

Immediate outcomes include increased awareness among participating 'caseras' on gender violence prevention, and their appropriation of the support platform within the market. Intermediate outcomes aim for the platform to formalize alliances with feminist collectives to continue training processes and offer specialized legal and psychological support. Ultimately, the platform is expected to generate resources for its sustainability, providing economic benefits to participants and creating a model that can be extended to other markets.
