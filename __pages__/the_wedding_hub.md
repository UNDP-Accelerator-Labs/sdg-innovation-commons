THE WEDDING HUB

> Brief description of the innovation

The Wedding Hub is an online market place for vendors in event management. Often times when people hold events, such as weddings, parties etc they struggle with getting the information they need from service providers because they can't find it in one place and when they do find it, it is inaccurate and unreliable. What if all you had to do is walk into "one store" and pick all the vendors you need for your event and walk to the check out? That's the experience we have created for you on the WEDDING HUB and the beauty is IT'S ALL ONLINE. At the click of the button you will have all the information you need to make that informed  decision in a cost effective and stress-free manner. You will also receive notifications on offers and promotions from your favorite vendors.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will generate income for us and other vendors as it will help vendors attract their clients and would-be clients to one place but also help them gain and make referrals to other businesses in their networks. 
Operations of of existing businesses will be enhanced in that most will not need to hire extra staff to get their messaging out and handle such simple things as issuing quotations much more easily. The target market is the pool of existing vendors in Zambia and beyond. What the prize money will do is that it will help us scale up and acquire more proficient business intelligence tools to help us make life and business easier for other.

> Technical Feasibility

Vendors will be able to create and list their business profiles on our site, making their information accessible to our large pool of potential clients across our social media pages. 
The proposed implementation plan is on-going. This tool will be alive on the internet for as long as the internet exists. Those who create their accounts earlier will have the 'early bird' advantage that allows them to grow their numbers and maximise on them.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will help people still have access to information for their events without having to physically walk to a store, thereby reducing their risk of contracting viral diseases on making operational expenses that can be avoided.
