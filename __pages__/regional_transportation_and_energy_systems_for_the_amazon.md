> What is the estimated total cost to reproduce this solution?

The cost for replicating the regional transportation and energy systems proposed by Kara Solar is $250,000.

> What components/materials are needed to reproduce this solution?

The solution has 4 basic elements or building blocks. Among those components, there are small and large solar-powered boats, a charging station, and the production of batteries needed for all the components.

> Are these components/materials easily accessible locally or do they need to be imported?

Kara Solar aims to maximize the use of local materials in the different sites of implementation, but certain components are not available in the local market and need to be outsourced.

> Are there technical prerequisites, tools or infrastructure to implement this solution? (For example, is access to a power source or the Internet required?)

There are technical know-hows that form part of the training program provided by Kara Solar to new technicians. Some of those materials are available online.

> Is replicating this solution a task suited to a single person or does it require a group or team effort?

To replicate the regional transportation and energy system it is necessary to have a group of 3 to 4 people that complete the training program to become technicians. That way they become the core team to sustain the solution in their community.

> Is there documentation available, such as written guides, videos, or other forms, illustrating the process of assembling the solution and performing routine maintenance?

First training module is available on the following link: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz8DgrVggPbJsKcT17AiU411-FEcD6T0C&amp;feature=shared

> Please acknowledge: The collaboration between the Solution Holder and the UNDP Accelerator Lab does not imply any financial commitment or offer from UNDP. Furthermore, UNDP assumes no legal or financial liability which may or may not arise from the pre-project design work in relation to the expansion of the energy solution. The selection of energy solutions is based on their open source nature and lack of intellectual property protection, depending on the solution owner. The Solution Owner represents to UNDP Accelerator Lab that all information provided is accurate to the best of its knowledge and belief. The Solution Owner acknowledges its responsibility for the Solution and undertakes not to hold UNDP liable for any potential collective claims, whether monetary or non-monetary, that may arise from its sharing and use with third parties. The solution owner also expressly confirms that the solution in question is open source and does not violate any existing intellectual property rights. UNDP and its partners reserve the right to involve relevant national organizations/institutions to validate the open source nature of the solution in question. The Solution Holder expressly commits to sharing their solution globally as a contribution to the UNDP Accelerator Labs “Discover and Deploy” energy campaign and open source innovation commons.
