## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiment seeks to establish whether the financing of all the expenses that the entrepreneur has to incur at the time of formalization will encourage formalization among the ventures that have these costs as a barrier and if, once formalized, their survival is maintained over time.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we finance the entire formalization process for entrepreneurs, then they will be much more motivated to complete the process.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Pay for the formalization process in all the stages to the experimental group of the experiment.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Entrepreneurs that are going through their formalization process 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data will come from the number of the entrepreneurs that completed their formalization process vs the ones who didn't 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Alliances, time allocation from team, planning.
