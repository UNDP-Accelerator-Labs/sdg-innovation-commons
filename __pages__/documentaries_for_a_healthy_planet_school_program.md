The initiative Escuela Planeta makes environmental films available to teachers from all over the country through a platform with films and pedagogical guides to integrate environmental education as a key element in middleschool and highschool.



The project considers three key elements: the cinematographic language,  the didactic guides designed along with the University of Guadalajara and on the tools that the teachers can contribute in each of their groups.



These guides have been developed with a model of constructivist education in which each young person builds their knowledge in an active and protagonist way. They provide didactic elements that allow teachers to create learning situations from Natural Sciences and Social Sciences subjects.



In addition, based on concepts such as eco-citizenship and environmental affectivity, it seeks to create a new relationship with nature, change the utilitarian lens for one of responsibility and emotion whose objective is to trigger concrete actions that affect their school space, as well as as its environmental and social environment.



Any teacher or student can access the program online, but the organization also does workshops on different locations.
