Piloting Remote Remand in Eswatini Courts
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the non-digitization judicial systems that lead limits access to justice particularly for the vulnerable. Governance is one of Eswatini’s pillars of the CPD from the point of the view is strengthening governance systems particularly within the judiciary. As part of the process, government duty bearers are capacitated to better provide efficient services that improves access to justice. Digitalization has been identified as a catalyst or an enabler and as such, the governance portfolio has identified the establishment if an Electronic Case Management System (ECMS) as central to the improvement of access to justice. The system has a multifunctionality that cuts across all departments of the Judiciary, including courts. COVID has not only exacerbated the vulnerabilities of health systems, but the justice system has been hit hard as well. Many judicial officers have been lost to the virus. During the lockdown, courts had to grind to a halt and while Eswatini was dealing with that, the country was hard hit by unprecedented civil unrest that led to the mass shooting of civilians because of riots and arson attacks on private property. The consequence of this this was a mass incarceration of offenders without trial including minors.   

The need for electronic systems to speed up the trials of alleged offenders became apparent that ever before, and all this happened at a time when courts were closed due to the rampant pandemic. Eswatini courts are still using ‘traditional’ and manual methods of managing cases including remanding. Defendant is expected to appear before presiding officers person during  trial and held offenders are also remanded in person.. The appearance in before the judge is to be maintained by the defendant through the period of pre-trial and through the remand phase. This requires physical transportation of held person throughout the process for a session that can can last approximately only 5 to 15 minutes on a weekly to for remand appearances. . The nature of remote remanding   allows for the efficient appearance of held persons remotely, a cost saving measure and also helps to observe COVID 19 regulations.

This is very much in line with the UNDP Eswatini 2021 – 2025 CPD where UNDP aims to ‘support the deployment of innovative digital solutions to specific areas of fiscal management, aid coordination, regional integration and strengthening of regulatory functions’.  To enhance government efficiencies, UNDP will support the deployment of innovative digital solutions to specific areas of fiscal management, aid coordination, regional integration and strengthening of regulatory functions. Through the Accelerator Lab, UNDP will support and promote the use of innovative digital solutions to enhance efficiencies.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Government in 2012 initiated the installation of a digital systems in magistrate courts, however, the system did not work because installation was never completed and there was legal framework that supported digital courts, including remote remand. It is only in 2018 that such a law was passed/enacted but the roll out of remote remand could not be implemented due to obsolete or dysfunctional equipment. The absence of law supporting the admission of virtual evidence in court coupled with elements of technophobia amongst some members of JCS resulted into the failure of the system. The emergence of the COVID 19 pandemic has significantly changed the perception of telecommuting technology and has become a driving force for digital transformation. Social distancing as a new normal has increased tremendously the general acceptance and use of ICT equipment as the backbone of doing business. There has never been a more opportune time to rump up the digitization of service delivery processes within the judiciary such as the implementation of remote remand. The general acceptance of digitalized processes in every quarter of the judiciary is high.

Given the manual nature of judicial processes in Eswatini and the lack of digital recording keeping systems, it is hard to estimate the total number of people that remanded into custody, however, the correctional services has estimated that a minimum of 60 held persons are remanded into custody weekly and this is for the Mbabane Magistrate Court where the pilot will be implemented.  Total of eight judicial officers lost their lives to the pandemic after contracting the virus, the number of those who contracted the virus but recovered is unknown however, indications are that it is high. Data on fatalities and positive cases of COVID 19 cases amongst inmates and held persons is unknown.

In 2021 when courts were closed due to rampant pandemic, and this happened against the backdrop of a high number of incarceration of civilians who were alleged to have broken the law during the civil unrest. Remand centers were overcrowded thus exposing held persons to COVID infections. Most people were help for a long-time including minors without trial or remand. It was almost as if they were locked up and the key was thrown away. Legal representatives could not have access to their clients due to the strict COVID regulations that were further exacerbated by a very stringent curfew. There were unconfirmed reports of violation of human rights on held persons in the form of illegal torture by security forces, and this went on unabated due to the closure of courts. Magistrates could not assess the well being of held persons during remand appearances.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value that the Accelerator lab is brining to solving this challenge is that, as opposed to waiting for the mobilization of resources to implement the broader ECMS, the AccLab has identified niche opportunity to immediately respond to the pandemic by piloting the remote remand system to reduce infections. Secondly, the AccLab has identified solution that will help curb the violation of human rights on held persons in the form of torture more so because the unrest is still ongoing, and more and more people are being arrested. Using the fundamental principles of lab protocols such as testing already existing solutions through experimentation, the proposed pilot by AccLab will provide definitive data on how best such a system can be rolled out nationally, building on lessons learnt from the pilot/experiment. As part of this experiment, the AccLab will attempt to support the Judiciary put together practise directives that will help interpret some of the identified grey areas of the Remote Participation Act of 2018 and this will ensure that the system is not used to further perpetrate human rights violations of held civilians. The research and experimentation approach brought by the Lab will greatly benefit UNDP as they work towards rolling out the broader ECMS and remote remanding is a part of it Learning from the failure of the first attempt, Lab will procure services of a technology company to support and capacitate the ICT department of the Judiciary in installing and maintaining the remote system. Administratively, the lab will work with the courts teams in giving them support in developing tools to monitor the efficiency of such a system. Furthermore, the CO CPD has identified the AccLab as the protagonist of promotion of innovative digital solutions to improve public service delivery and help advance the in implementation of SDGs. Therefore, the Remote Remand experiment will serve as a precursor or a litmus test for the readiness of the various judicial arms to move fully towards the broader Electronic Case Management System that is set to digitize judicial processes. Working on the challenge will also give insights on how the use of digital solutions in judicial services to addresses health concern in the advent of the pandemic; Streamline case management through increased reliance on e-filing tools; Increase use of digital platforms to conduct court hearings means that people who previously would have had difficulties commuting to court.

> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The Ministry of Justice and constitutional Affairs plays an oversight function for all institutions affiliated with the Judiciary. The ministry plays a critical role in supporting the judiciary to execute its function.  The Judiciary Headed by the Chief Justice is the man partner. The Judiciary supervises all magistrate courts and is responsible for how the Judiciary functions. This innovation is planned for and will implemented jointly with the representatives of the Judiciary. Given that there will be an installation of an end-to-end system both the Magistrate Courts and the remand centers, His Majesty’s Correctional Services is another strategic partner. They must also support the pilot for it to work. The Human Rights Commission and the Law Society will both provide advisory support to ensure that the systems are devoid of loopholes that can be used to perpetrate human rights violations. Finally, the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) is responsible of drafting and interpreting law on behalf of government. Should there be a need for regulations or practice directives, the AGO will provide that regal support.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Does digital transformation play a role in improving efficiency in judicial processes and increase access to justice?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Improving access to to justice involves a number of stakeholders that cut includes the Judiciary, Ministry of Justice, Human Rights Commission, His Majesty's Correctional Service, the Law Society. In order to ensure that the system works with minimal challenges, it is important to harness the power of co-creation  and collective intelligence. Sense making will be used to identify the challenge related to the none operationalization of virtual courts.  Finally, given that the digitization of courts has been in government plans but was never quite operationalized, the planned intervention will provide proof of concept on whether remote remand can in fact solve the challenge question. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Digitalization of court proceedings is somewhat of a novel phenomenon. Record keeping is extremely manual and it is always hard to retrieve information or records. As such, there is great reliance on the collective intelligence ascertained from Judicial offers and those that are part of the value chain. It is very imperative to map the ecosystem to first understand who is a player and that ecosystem mapping facilitates the collective intelligence gathering. Some of the data that we are using is through physical observations, where observe remand proceeding to determine the likelihood of the digital system to work. The is also a plan to undertake in depth interview to solicit the views of held persons but more importantly, to get the views of human rights advocates so that the roll out of the system is done in a way that promotes human rights.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Ministry of justice and the magistrate courts have supported the lab team in documenting the experiment for testing the digitalized remand sessions in the past 1 and half years. Reports have shown that the digital system is fully utilized and has now replaced the need to conduct physical remote remanding sessions.  The experiment learnings and outcomes have been positive such that a new magistrate court is currently in the process of also converting to conducting remote remands digitally. We have considered this as an organic growth phase for the experiment which we have noted as a positive outcome of the work of the lab.
