> Brief description of the innovation

Since new tertiary schools are being opened they usually need stationary goods which are not adequately provided for, mobile money is the modern way of doing business but in schools they are not readily available.

> Technical Feasibility

The stationary shop should from 06:00am to 23:00pm on shift basis where some of partners or workers should be students, making sure the school can have all stationary needs within their proximity,

> Anticipated Social Impact

Those vulnerable students may find means of survival and learning at the same time, students will have most of their stationary needs within the school to improve quality education. We as implementers will have a sustainable business even when there is no employment
