> Title of the innovation

An investigation into the climatic and environmental conditions ( soil pH,soil type. soil health,wind speed, environmental temperatur, rainfall pattern and cloud cover) that favour the growth of Solwezi Red Beans in Solwezi, Kalumbila and Mwinilinga Districts as compared to other parts of Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

I will grow Solwezi Red Beans in Solwezi, Kalumbila, Chibombo and Chongwe and then try to compare the quality of the bean plant growing, quantity of beans produced per hectare, the mass of each bean seed produced, quality of the bean seeds e.t.c.
The Principal reason for this innovation is to try and research and understand the climatic and environmental conditions that are required for the growth of Solwezi Red Beans.The fields in Solwezi and Kalumbila will be used as a Control Experiment as all the required conditions required for the growth of this bean seed variety ate available here.
Comparisons will then be made for the produce  between each district.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Knowing and understanding the climatic and environmental conditions required for the growth of Solwezi Red Beans will result into commercial farmers entering into the growing of Solwezi Red Beans at a large scale.This will help create employment for the local people and also improve food security in Zambia and the SADC region.In addition, commercial farmers will also have an inmproved income flow when they sale there produce (Solwezi Red Beans).

> Technical Feasibility

It will be an experimental design in which I will grow beans in four different districts of Zambia .i.e Solwezi, Chibombo, Kalumbila and Chongwe and then compare the produce.
The fields in Solwezi and Kalumbila will be used as a Control Experiment.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve food security in Zambia and the SADC region at large.
