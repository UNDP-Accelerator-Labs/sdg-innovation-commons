Zero Challenge Think Tanks Team (Z-3T) Economic Competition Platform

> Brief description of the innovation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
ZERO CHALLENGE TEAM – ECONOMIC COMPETITION PLATFORM
In an attempt to CONTRIBUTE to the efforts of Government and its cooperating partners in tackling/solving development challenges facing our country, I founded and patented in January 2021, an initiative called the Zero Challenge Think Tanks Team (Z-3T), shortened as the Zero Challenge Team.  
This is an economic competition platform where society and industry economic entities may lodge their economic challenges (investment, operational or any other) for practical solutions, at a REWARD to the problem solving participants, with the highest reward to the participant(s) with the best or optimal workable solution.
Depending on the confidentiality, or non-confidentiality nature of the economic challenge lodged, the problem solving exercise shall be open for public participation, from which the solutions will be provided to clients on an open stage. But when/where confidentiality is required problem solving should be confined to the in-house Zero Challenge Team, with the solution provided privately to the client organization. Challenges for tackling shall be solicited and unsolicited.
This initiative/ platform emanates from the realization that:
Firstly, there should be a good number of economic entities and members of our society that have economic challenges for which they would need workable solutions for them to appropriately invest, compete, survive and grow, rather than winding down resulting into loss of jobs for businesses, or depression and death for individuals.
Secondly, Zambia has plenty of latent brains of graduates and non-graduates (nationals and foreigners), who may have no meaningful income generating activities and some who may have meaningful income generating activities, or may even be retired, but who would gladly be willing to share their skills, knowledge and experience (participate) in solving the development economic challenges of our nation, for a REWARD.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Among others, the possible benefits of the Zero Challenge platform are that;
1.	Youths will be kept busy as they await formal jobs

While the Government and its cooperating partners are working to create jobs for the youth, many young people will be kept busy on this platform solving pertinent economic challenges lodged, while at the same time raise an income for themselves, rather than wait idly for a formal job to be found.

2.	Investors spotting knowledgeable ,experienced and skilled man power 

Investors and other economic stakeholders may lodge and sponsor feasible economic challenges in order to identify on the spot desired skills, knowledge and experience.


3.	Latent brains and Ideas attracted
Latent brains and ideas of the graduates and non-graduates  (local and foreign) will be attracted to solving development challenges of the country, which should be a positive contribution towards economic growth, job creation and improved social welfare.
4.	Open platform for lodging economic challenges

The industry and members of society shall have a readily available open platform to resort to for solving their investment and operational problems.

5.	Skills and knowledge brought into the ‘spotlight’

Graduates and non-graduates who have no formal employment and are seeking jobs will have an open platform to showcase their abilities, knowledge and experience to would be employers, because participation on the Zero Challenge platform brings them into the ‘spotlight’ 
Considering that wisdom does not reside in one brain, it should be stated that this idea/initiative is open for refining. I believe that once refined and implemented, the initiative may make a worthwhile contribution to the development of the country.

> Technical Feasibility

Prototype

A Video demonstrating  of participants solving an economic problems before judges and an audience was presented to PACRA for patenting in January 2021.

Implementation Plan

Once sponsorship or funding is available, a team should be put up and solicit for economic challenges to be solved from the industry and public, as well as create awareness for public participation.
