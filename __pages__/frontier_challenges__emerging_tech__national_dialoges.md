Frontier Challenges: Emerging Tech: National Dialogues 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Challenge statement: Our challenge is that “voices” of people, experts, and decision-makers—on emerging frontier technologies such as AI are often overlooked in development and policymaking. With this intervention and thoroughly developed methodologies we want to create 4 dialogues where these voices can surface on the perceived benefits and risks related to the development and deployment of these technologies. This builds on AccLabs understanding that there is an untapped wealth of relevant knowledge and perspectives in collective intelligence that should be considered in the development and regulation of frontier technologies at the global level.
The challenge statements on the 4 dialogues are not set in stone but some early drafts are on the following topics:
1. GenAI in education in N. Macedonia / Leveraging leverage AI for innovation in education while maintaining ethical safeguards.
2. AI Developments - Governance and Tech
3. How technology affects information integrity in North Macedonia?
4. TBD




> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



As emerging technologies rapidly evolve—ranging from artificial intelligence and blockchain to digital platforms and automation—governments worldwide, including North Macedonia, face significant challenges in keeping pace. The rapid diffusion of these innovations often outstrips the ability of policymakers to regulate effectively, integrate them into governance structures, and anticipate their societal impact. This challenge is driven by a combination of factors, including limited institutional capacity, fragmented policy frameworks, and a lack of structured cross-sector dialogue between government, private sector innovators, academia, and civil society.
In North Macedonia, as in many other countries, regulatory frameworks remain reactive rather than anticipatory, creating governance gaps that hinder both responsible innovation and equitable access to emerging technologies. In addition, there are specific EU accession related transpositions of EU laws/ or approximations needed. Key challenges include a slow adaptation of legal and ethical standards, insufficient digital skills among policymakers, and underdeveloped mechanisms for citizen engagement in tech governance. As a result, technological advancements often lead to regulatory blind spots, ethical dilemmas, and unequal distribution of benefits, exacerbating digital divides and limiting the potential of emerging technologies to drive inclusive development. Addressing these issues requires forward-looking strategies, multi-stakeholder engagement, and adaptive governance models that enable policymakers to respond proactively to technological change.

Unlike previous technological and industrial revolutions where high-income countries had a significant head start, with emerging technologies of the 21st century the playing field is more leveled at least in terms of access. However, differences in infrastructure, digital literacy, data ecosystems, and regulatory environments still create disparities in how effectively countries can harness its potential. The AccLab team spearheaded the process of preparation of the Digital Readiness Assessment DRA for North Macedonia in 2023. Post DRA, the team organized two discussions with larger group of stakeholders where two key findings were elaborated. One digital literacy and two digital transformations in business, particularly for MSME. Both of these discussions and the DRA highlighted that digital transformation is lacking behind in a couple of areas such as skills, both in general and public, and administration.  There are specialized talent in the country in specific emerging tech fields such as AI, gaming, blockchain where our hypothesis is that these people can be the enablers for smoother digital transformation using Gen AI. Gen AI is expected to influence the talent, products, services etc.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Unlike the other units in our CO who are more focused on implementation of digitalization we are more focused on sensemaking on the emerging technologies and what they will mean to both development work and the future of our society . With this dialogues we will be working for the first time with some stakeholders and that is why we are branding this as a big bet.





> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



With Emerging technologies all countries start at the same line—but who wins the race depends on governance, digital readiness, and inclusivity. How can we ensure no one is left behind? #ET4Development #FrontierTech
