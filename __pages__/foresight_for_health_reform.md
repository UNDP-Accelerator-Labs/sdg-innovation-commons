## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Foresight for Health Reform
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is landing a foresight offer on health from UNDP to government in the Malaysian context. While corporations have taken up foresight methods, and the Malaysian government has a foresight institute (MyForesight), use of foresight, future methods, and anticipatory governance has not taken root.&nbsp;

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Malaysia launched the MyForesight institute in 2012, to offer foresight and futures tools to private sector and government actors. Conversations with MyForesight showed limited influence in planning in government ministries and agencies, with little to no adoption of anticipatory governance approaches.&nbsp;


In the wake of COVID-19, there has been impetus for health reform. The minister made this a central agenda advocated for future-proofing both healthcare and the health reform process, creating a potential opening for landing a foresight offer.

Malaysia's public healthcare expenditure per GDP has hovered around 2.5%, about half of the WHO recommendation. Out of pocket healthcare spending rose to 35% in 2020. Meanwhile, there has been a bottle-neck in absorbing medical housemen, nurses, pharmacists, etc., due to limited health budgets, despite the clear need for a larger medical workforce in the future, especially with a rapidly aging demographic and surge of non-communicable diseases.&nbsp;

Malaysia has experienced unprecedented protests and walk-outs by medical doctors in the public sector.&nbsp;

Private conversations with public health professionals have revealed low morale and poor hospital and clinic conditions, especially in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak).&nbsp;

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This is a high-risk, high-reward challenge. UNDP in Malaysia has not worked in health for a long time, but contains economic expertise pertinent to the challenge of health reform. If the AccLab can get the foot-in-the-door, it would open up a new are of work for UNDP, with major implications for Malaysia's development future.&nbsp;

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are future-proofing the health system.&nbsp;

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We are trying to generate buy-in for futures methods within the Ministry of Health by prototyping futures&nbsp; and systems solutions with them. The challenge of interest expressed by our partners was evaluation of a programme where dental health services are brought to local communities--but with little uptake from target beneficiaries. We need to map why these services are not getting buy-in and understand how to bridge the gap in a sustainable manner.&nbsp;

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are prototyping a horizon scanning process with partners in the Ministry of Health that demonstrate the utility of systems thinking and foresight for anticipatory governance, policy, and regulation.&nbsp;

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Demand for dental services, perceptions of rural communities toward ministry of health staff, perceptions of dental staff delivering services.&nbsp;
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are looking to deepen understanding of systems and foresight tools with key actors in the Ministry of Health, in order to generate demand for foresight offers from UNDP for the larger health reform process.&nbsp;
