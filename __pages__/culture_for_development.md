## Title

Culture for Development
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Unlock Peru’s cultural potential to accelerate the achievement of SDG.  Given the social and physical distance caused by the pandemic, strengthen cultural experiences and formats to connect with UNDP’s audiences and scientific content as well as expand our work’s impact Mobilize young changemakers awareness and action through cultural experiences. Explore/Demonstrate the impact of cultural experiences as tools for opening dialogues, nourishing creativity and social exchange.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Peru has been in a sanitary emergency characterized by quarantine and social distancing since March 2020. Cultural industries tend to be seasonal and intermittent, which meant that people in those industries were left without livelihoods and sources of income overnight and without any safety net. We have seen several attempts to self-organize given the uncertainty of the situation and the lack of government support (the Culture Ministry was one of the last ministries to provide direct support to artists in terms of cash transfers). In addition, we’re seeing a social need to reconnect and rediscover spaces where people can rebuild their relationships with each other after months of not being together, as well as a need to rebuild an identity after a very confrontational and aggressive electoral campaign in early 2021. In this context, culture as both a tool for development and an end in itself in reactivating the industry seems more relevant than ever.

Culture Ministry’s June 2020 survey: Based on 10,452 surveyed professionals dedicated to cultural industries, 162 million Peruvian soles were lost between March and June 2020 due to COVID-19. 27% of these losses correspond to education and cultural training activities. 90% of those surveyed can’t cover their fixed costs (https://www.gob.pe/institucion/cultura/informes-publicaciones/633376-informe-sobre-el-impacto-del-estado-de-emergencia-por-el-covid-19-en-el-sector-de-las-artes-museos-e-industrias-culturales-y-creativas-resultados-generales). Peru has 516 recognized cultural focal points (puntos de cultura). These are local and community-based organizations that aim to develop an empowered citizenship through cultural rights among the most vulnerable populations such as children and youth.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

No other actors within the UNDP Peru CO are currently working on using cultural solutions to address development challenges, and after months in lockdown this becomes even more relevant than ever. The volatile national political and social context requires solutions that promote dialogue, trust and diversity of opinions to counteract radicalization and violence that permeated society after the 2021 elections and might resume due to the local 2022 elections.  The Lab has a crosscutting view of the whole office and programmes, which facilitates the application of crosscutting cultural tools such as festivals, showcases or public space intervention.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We’re unlocking the power of culture to bring people back together, opening dialogues about our future, building trust and activating climate action. Everyone is invited! How will you join in?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Does culture have space within UNDP’s toolbox? Communicational campaigns are not enough to share UNDP’s knowledge with a wider audience given the landslide of information younger people receive every day. Could cultural formats help us reach a more diverse and younger crowd and in a deeper way? How can UNDP support the reactivation of cultural industries in Peru? What's the role of cultural experiences and formats in strategic “deep scaling”?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use these methods and tools to design and carry out small experiments that will hopefully show our UNDP colleagues as well as our external partners that culture formats are extremely useful to communicate relevant content (beyond traditional social media campaigns or official events). We will also test how culture can become a trust-building tool through dialogue and rediscovering spaces thought to be more rigid (eg. a bank) or too informal (eg. a land parcel cultivated by children). 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The cultural industries are largely informal and invisible to the traditional national accounts.  There have been limited attempts at using cultural tools to accelerate the SDGs within UNDP projects and we don’t have information on their potential impact.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Culture Ministry and the Municipality of Lima could become two natural champions for our work on this challenge since they could turn our findings into public policy or longer term projects.
