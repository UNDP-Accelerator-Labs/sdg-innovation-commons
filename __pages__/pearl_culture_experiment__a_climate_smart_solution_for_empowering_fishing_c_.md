Pearl Culture Experiment: A Climate-Smart Solution for Empowering Fishing Communities in Bangladesh
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that many of our small islander's specially the vulnerable community are experiencing uncertainty of lives and livelihood due to climate change and natural hazards every year. Along with this many of the coastal islanders are in threat of joblessness and stress due to the sea level rise. But this coastal community has unseen potential to cope up with the challenges and look for alternative livelihood options.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Bangladesh’s coastal regions have long been vulnerable to natural disasters due to their geographical location. The country’s 710 km coastline is frequently impacted by cyclones, storm surges, and flooding. Historical records show devastating cyclones, such as those in 1970 and 1988, 1988, which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Over the decades, the increasing frequency and intensity of these disasters have been linked to climate change, rising sea levels, and degraded natural defenses like mangrove forests. The coastal regions of Bangladesh face a persistent cycle of disasters, including cyclones (e.g., Cyclone Amphan in 2020), tidal floods, and saltwater intrusion. While disaster preparedness has improved over the years with better early warning systems and cyclone shelters, challenges remain in ensuring resilience. Many embankments are breached annually, displacing thousands. The salinization of agricultural land has reduced crop yields, while coastal erosion destroys homes and infrastructure. Data from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 says 24.1% of households in the river char areas and 26% of households in the coastal char lands earn less than Tk. 7,000 monthly, while the national figure stands at 22.6%. People of the island generally remains underprivileged as they lack alternative livelihoods and fall under extreme poverty due to sudden natural calamities

Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) showed that Between 1980 and 2020, Bangladesh experienced over 200 cyclones, with an increasing trend in both frequency and intensity. Recent examples include Cyclone Sidr (2007), which caused over 3,000 fatalities, and Cyclone Amphan (2020), which resulted in damages exceeding $13 billion (USD). Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said that over 50% of coastal land in Bangladesh is affected by saltwater intrusion, reducing agricultural productivity by 15-20% annually. and crop yields for staples like rice have declined significantly in saline-prone areas, contributing to food insecurity for millions. However, it is a common phenomenon that the char dwellers always fight with the hunger, poverty, illiteracy, less farm productivity, climatic disaster, etc. Island people are poor, illiterate and deprived of employment opportunities and health facilities. According to World Bank, nearly 12 million people live in poverty in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The existing fearful living of char dwellers and livelihood conditions, for instance, vulnerabilities arising from natural disasters such as flood, erosion, storm, cyclone, tidal surge; poverty, which is 2.7 times higher than the national average, and its consequent malnutrition; illiteracy; inadequate education, health and sanitation services; and limited rights to, if not absence of, land and livelihood resources, leave them in a never ending fight for survival. The means for improving upon them still remains ambiguous.[4]

The nation is enhanced by unparalleled natural beauty and a wildlife sanctuary amidst the little islands. However, it is surprising that these islands' potential is still hidden and that the islanders are not benefiting from it. The unprecedented environmental shock and limited opportunities for alternative livelihoods have put their lives in jeopardy. They don't have any specific business to support their family, except than farming and fishing. Usually, they barely make ends meet. Furthermore, due to their remoteness and inadequate infrastructure, the small island regions with their many issues are unable to participate in the advancement of global growth, leaving their economies in the dark. Given how serious these issues are, it is

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The AccLab has strong ties to the public and commercial sectors, as well as other UNDP initiatives that are actively working on small island sustainable development. Because of its special location, the lab can act as a link between various organizations by creating a framework for multi-layered collaboration. Nonetheless, the Lab has previously focused on informal economy and alternative livelihood projects that combine Bangladeshi coastal regions' blue tourism. We will therefore be able to use the lessons learnt in small islands thanks to the extensive experience. Supporting our cooperative strategy in tiny islands shows a dedication to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, blue-tourism promotion, capacity building, and the promotion of local ownership and responsible governance for the long-term success of the region.
