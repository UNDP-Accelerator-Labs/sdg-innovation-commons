> Title of the innovation

The company would be involved in the servicing of electric motors of large scale houses such as Mines, Power generation entities, Water &amp; Sewarage entities, Farms, Manufacturing and Processing Plants. This is a service that is currently carried out in Zambia on a small scale with a large number of electric motors to South Africa for servicing as there is no sufficient capacity or expertise in Zambia.

> Brief description of the innovation

The directors decided to focus on business in the provision of service to repair the electric motors for various industries. 

An electric motor is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. 

In normal  motoring mode, most motors operate through the interaction between an electric motor's magnetic field and winding current to generate force within the motor. 

Found in the industries are various sizes and types of motors such as industrial fans, blowers, traction motors and pumps. 

Electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources such as from batteries or alternating current (AC) sources such as from the Zesco power grid. 

Brand new electric motors have a life span of between 2 to 5 years depending on their usage and the environment in which they operate in.

Their replacement cost would usually be twice as much as the cost of servicing them; therefore, most users would prefer to service the motors to make a saving. A properly serviced motor has a working span of upto 90% of a brand new motor.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Iam a qualified Artisan with 16 years work experience in the mines coupled with entrepreneur skills. I also have certificates in General Principles of Law,Finance &amp; Accounting and Purchasing &amp; Supply Chain Management. 

Perhaps, most importantly, I have a passionate ambition to set up the workshop to repair and / or rewind various electric motors of High and Low Temsion for the market and industry such as the mines both in Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo,Manufactures,Water &amp; Sewarage Companies, Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Companies, etc,etc.

I have already spoken to Zambia  - China Economic &amp; Trade Cooperation Zone (ZCCZ) situated in Chambishi along Kitwe -Chingola Road for leasing out 1,460 Square metres of the workshop with a block of offices and necessary amenities for US$3 per square metre per month. However, the rate can come down for long lease of over 3 -5 years. 

ZCCZ Management are more than ready and excited to support the venture by allowing and influencing the consortium Companies within and outside the zone having their motors,transformers,welding machines and gensets manufactured or repaired or rewind in the workshop. 

Value additional to the environment is the reduction of disposing off worn-out or faulty motors by having them repaired for reuse in the production sites.

> Technical Feasibility

This project to kick start requires machinery, consumables (ie motor materials),skilled and semi- skilled labour and office fixtures with related needs such as utility vehicles. 

The machinery will be used for stripping and making coils and other activities in the process of repairing various sizes and types of electric motors.This innovation will earn forex apart from creating jobs and tax payments to Zambian government. 

Whitelegg company which is based in the UK is the source of these machinery and the quotation is available. 

The total amount required in British Pound is £575,897.00; at the current exchange rate will be about ZMW 16,000,000.00.

Out of this amount ZMW 14,500,000.00 will be used to purchase required machinery and the balance of ZMW 1,500,000.00 will be for initial running expenses including procuring office furniture, utility vehicles and pay salaries for the first three months. 

The proposed implementation plan is as follows;

1.Secure the loan or sponsorship to finance the project by January 2022.

2.Order placement for equipment/ machinery  by March 2022

3.Secure workshop tailored to our needs,Hire employees, Purchase utility vehicles and consumable materials  by April 2022

4.Commissioning of the workshop and commence operations by June 2022.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will provide major savings of United States Dollar as there will be no further need to send motors to South Africa for servicing. This will ensure employment creation in Zambia as opposed to the current situation were employment is created in South Africa. 

The possibility of servicing motors from Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Katanga province could lead to forex inflow into Zambia. 

The workshop workers need to be up skilled to produce quality output resulting into retaining skill for future generations. 

Creation of over 20 quality permanent pensionable jobs for Zambians in the initial stages of operation. There is also a possibility of more jobs been created with both verticle and forward integration opportunities. 

This business could inspire other skilled Zambians to set - up workshops in their various disciplines as opposed to remaining as employees of various foreign owned entities.
