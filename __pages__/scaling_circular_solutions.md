Scaling Innovative Circular Solutions
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Since 2022, UNDP and UNICEF have been working on an initiative dubbed WasteX Lab, after emerging as finalists and winners of the Greenshark Innovation Challenge 2022. Capitalizing on a center of excellence (COE) - a collaborative facility emphasizing circular economy methodologies - WasteX Lab aims to deliver guidance, industry best practices, research, support, and training. Through strategic partnerships with local stakeholders, UNDP and UNICEF engage a carefully curated cohort of enterprises, predominantly comprising youth and women, selected via an innovation challenge to devise and execute solutions addressing the pervasive issues surrounding solid waste management in Zanzibar.

WasteX Lab initiative combines Human-Centered Design, Behavioral Science, and digital technologies to establish a platform fostering peer-to-peer leadership, knowledge exchange, experimentation, and business growth. Since its inception, the initiative has demonstrated notable achievements, gained traction and attracted additional resources from various partners. The initial funding of the project from the Greenshark Innovation Challenge was depleted by June 2023, which necessitated collaborative efforts to solicit more funding to scale and sustain the initiative. 

In the growth phase of this challenge, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Tanzania is teaming up with UNICEF, to widen the scope of the initiative and expound different levers of change. Leveraging the combined comparative advantages of both institutions, the initiative seeks to deliver formal and informal education on circular practices, strengthen entrepreneurial capacities to promote innovative circular solutions and businesses, foster market development and the enabling environment for circular businesses and promote innovative digital solutions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Zanzibar, the high per capita generation of solid waste, along with the inappropriate disposal of the waste products, is a problem across all sectors of Zanzibar’s economy. It is estimated that about 60% of all solid waste produced in Zanzibar is not properly collected and sorted, leading to the accumulation of untreated and potentially toxic substances at unauthorized landfills and dumpsites (RGoZ, 2013). In this regard, tourism-oriented establishments, such as hotels and restaurants, contribute disproportionately to waste production, representing roughly 80% of all waste generated in Zanzibar (The Citizen, 2018).

Given the high resource requirements of the tourism sector and the rapid turnover of guests, hotels consume many disposable appliances, such as plastic bottles, food and kitchen materials, tissue paper and laundry products. Without sustainable practices, the resulting rubbish and sewage produced could harm both the terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



UNDP accelerator Lab has conducted a number of experiments in the area of waste management in Zanzibar, including mapping of waste dump sites by type to explore mechanisms to attract bankable investments in recycling technologies to increase efficiency in solid waste management. Data and learnings from previous experiments produced valuable insights to lay the groundwork for advanced experiments. An example of this is the crowd mapping work conducted in Zanzibar, which revealed the gravity of the waste management challenge in the Island. Further, the partnership with UNICEF, and the State University of Zanzibar, has allowed for resource optimization and knowledge sharing, attracting more unusual partners and solidifying data collection to inform programming and policy work.

In collaboration with UNICEF Tanzania, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Tanzania supported the proposal writing and eventually won the 2022 Greenshark Innovation Challenge worth $250,000. The grant was split between the two agencies, and the project was officially launched in 2022, by H.E Dr. Hussein Mwinyi, the president of Zanzibar, at the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA). In this initiative, a lecture room at SUZA, was transformed into an innovation hub, notably, “WasteX Lab”, leveraging a Center of Excellence (COE) approach to provide a shared facility focusing on circular economy technologies to provide leadership, best practices, research, support, and training. 

In this initiative, the AccLab has also been working closely with the Bureau for Policy and Programme Support.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



The challenge aims to explore how a holistic and systemic approach to promoting circular solutions and businesses, can advance the adoption of responsible waste management practices and systems, for climate action.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Behavioral insights: the challenge will leverage the Centre of Excellence approach and research capabilities to expound how behavioral change measures can drive a transition towards responsible production and consumption. 

Proof of concept: The current phase, will build on the existing work of WasteX Lab project, the initial design serving as the proof of concept for the subsequent phases

Systems Thinking: A systems thinking approach will be critical to ensuring that proposed interventions are taking into consideration various dynamics in the field. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Ecosystem mapping: Considering how complex the waste management challenge is, mapping of different actors will be crucial to solidify the understanding of the challenge. There are many players in the field but a systematic mapping will allow for a systems thinking approach to addressing the issue. 

External Reports and studies: For further understanding on the situation and existing interventions to ensure interventions that are relevant to the challenge

Collective intelligence: Consultations with different actors including, businesses, innovators and law makers, to gather insights around the challenge. Currently different actors operate in silos hindering exchange of information critical to addressing some of the underlying challenges 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The next phase would be to scale the initiatives to other regions of Tanzania, and cross boarder. Forming partnerships with Higher Learning Institutions, and innovation hubs will be crucial to ensure scalability and sustainability.
