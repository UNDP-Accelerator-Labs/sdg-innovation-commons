> Title of the innovation

Eradicating poverty through agricultural intervention

> Brief description of the innovation

Awereness of agricultural practices to young people on food production as an income sustainable project or business through teaching and learning of agricultural science from a tender age let's say primary schools.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Food is one of the social needs of every human being. Food production should be key to human survival. For those who would be involved in food production, the entire national population is their target market because no one can live without food.Our nation is blessed with a vast untapped land which can be made available to young people and make them self sustainable in food production and income generation.Food industry is always growing with growth in population hence making awareness of it as a viable business from tender age of citizens is cardinal so that as many people as possible participant in provision of a desirable health and affordable food basket of individuals as well as the nation at large. This innovation would lead to 50% of the young and future generation becoming self sustainable in income generation upon completion of secondary school education. When more people become involved in food production, it would result in competition hence prices of food commodities would reduce and become affordable.

> Technical Feasibility

Mindset is very important in the development of any substance. At the moment most people especially the younger generation think agriculture is for the poor or uneducated people in preference for white collar jobs. Hence if from onset the young people are taught that actually agriculture is not only a money spinner but a necessity for anyone's survival, the better. With the coming of technology and improved methods of food production, no one is supposed to die of hunger. Let it be implemented at a sample level of 50% of primary schools to start learning agriculture science as a compulsory subject both in theory and practical, preparing the young learners to take up agriculture as a business so that upon completion of secondary education, they do not search for white collar jobs but rather be empowered with land and necessary farming equipment in form of loans to start up their farming businesses,in the same way that the other group of young people are given student's loans to further their education in universities. This would mean that 50% of our young people would be becoming self employed upon completion of secondary schools education.

> Anticipated Social Impact

A hungry citizen is unhappy and unproductive. By implementing the above innovation, those directly involved would never go hungry and further more they would be providing a service to the nation at large by improving the much needed food basket. Further more when all food is grown locally, it would become cheaper and affordable unlike when it's imported. When food becomes affordable, it would lead to a healthy and productive people and nation at large. The government would also have less pressure on provision of employment to its young people since 50% of those completing secondary schools education would be self employed in their agricultural practices and businesses.
