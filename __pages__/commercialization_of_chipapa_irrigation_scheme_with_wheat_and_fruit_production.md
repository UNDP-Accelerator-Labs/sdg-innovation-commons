Commercialization of Chipapa Irrigation scheme with wheat and fruit production

> Brief description of the innovation

Chipapa Irrigation scheme has been in existence from 1950's and operating on a 10 ha land with over 125 members growing different vegetables. With this limited piece of land farmers are not able to commercialize operation and benefit from economies of scale. Therefore farmers had agreed to repurpose their Large maize fields for wheat and fruit production and willing to work with Rinsu Agri-Services  as their aggregators.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through aggregation system,  the company will be able to purchase all products from scheme members at farm gate prices and do the following processes: sorting, packing and packaging, loading and dispatching and distribute to  the nearest market boarders.Using the start-up seed, Rinsu Agri-Services will introduce out-grower schemes for wheat production to farmers. Hence helping out the farmers to up scale. For  fruit: some seedlings will be sold to the communities and public through the establishment of  road side outlets along Lusaka- Livingston road. Small Juice industry will be needed for processing fruits. In terms of environment benefits , clean energy will be promoted by construction of industry-size biodigester to produce biogas for sale to the community members. The raw materials for biodigester will be biomass left after extracting juice from fruits.

> Technical Feasibility

As an aggregetor, there is need for construction of multipurpose administrative centre comprising ICT, accounting, banking, warehousing,hall for aggregation , meeting and classes. In addition to the skills that scheme members poses ,the company will train them plant propagation such as air layering,  grafting, budding etc and assistance on  up land wheat management. Another plan is to continue with, but commercializing high quality fruit and vegetables and portion the 10 ha land for different seedlings that includes for fruits.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This concept will impart beneficiaries with knowledge and skills on plant propagation, agribusiness, entrepreneurship, group dynamics/team building, leadership, marketing, management,record keeping. It will also be a source of employment for youths in the community as there's alcohol abuse. There will be also improved income This will bring new products to the current market as there no suppliers for fruits and vegetables on large scale.
