## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Smart Erdenet (Mongolia)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

UNDP Accelerator Lab Mongolia identified digital transformation as its frontier challenge. As part of the digitalization effort, Mongolia's third populous city, Erdenet, is currently exploring ways to incorporate technology and innovation in its development. As part of this effort, the local researchers developed a first draft of Smart Erdenet program. Accelerator Lab provided feedback to make the draft program more inclusive, systematic, and integrated. We are currently exploring the possibilities to collaborate and partner on this program.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Erdenet officials are seeking to incorporate innovation and technology in their city to make it a smart city. Potential collaboration is currently being discussed. Preliminary 6 goals include participatory smart governance, healthy and safe city, smart waste management, smart transportation, environmentally friendly infrastructure, and circular economy. Accelerator Lab could help local government to explore innovative solutions in 1-2 goal areas.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The city has over 100,000 residents, of which half live in semi-informal residential neighborhood. The city experiences problems such as congestion, environmental pollution, and unemployment. 27% of the households require financial assistance. Without having a human-centered approach, the Smart city initiative could further alienate the vulnerable population.

·       The preliminary plan that was developed by a local team is heavy on technical interventions. This raises an issue regarding the effectiveness of the program. Similar approaches could be seen in most of the tech and digital initiatives by the government. They prioritize tech and IT specialists, which results interventions that prioritizes technical tools rather than improving lives of residents. ·       There is very little input from the residents’ point of view as local government team is not prioritizing citizen engagement. Citizen participation and buy-in are essential for this level of intervention.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab Mongolia could provide new approaches in the development and implementation of this Smart Erdenet initiative. We can deliver human-centered approach and experimental learnings. If we can prove the concept of chosen activities via experimentation, we can scale at the city and regional levels. We believe smart solutions and approaches will become much more common in the coming years, and if we help them set it up effectively this will improve the process for the other local governments.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Accelerator Lab Mongolia is exploring innovative solutions to make Erdenet smart city. This means leveraging technology and innovations to make Erdenet more comfortable to the residents, attractive to the businesses, and environmentally friendly.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can technology and innovative solutions help Erdenet to provide accessible, effective, and inclusive services? Once we figure out specific sub-area to focus on, we will have better learning questions. ·       What would be the grassroot innovative solutions that we can scale? ·       How can technological interventions improve living conditions in Erdenet? Attract businesses? Reduce environmental impact?  ·        What are low-cost, high yield technological and innovative solutions that could help local community?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Approaches we’ll employ will help the Smart Erdenet program to be more inclusive (participation) and comprehensive (systems thinking).

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We yet to fully dive into the process. We will likely use statistical information first.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Scaling of this exploratory ACTION will depend on how the partnership with Erdenet government evolves.
