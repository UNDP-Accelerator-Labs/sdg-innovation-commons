Mekteam is an environmental consultancy with a mission. The founder who is an avid environmentalist realized that people who are not directly connected with environmental issues by virtue of their job or education are often not very interested in environment related topics, particularly in events such as corporate trainings. So the founder of Mekateam thought of ways to make such environmental trainings more engaging and hence came up with activity based learnings and games for such trainings. These include climate game, river game and food game which make the participants more energetic, enthusiastic and curious about environmental issues. Mekateam aspires to eventually work with the national educational curriculum developers to make the educational content more engaging that can inspire more people to take part in environmental action.
