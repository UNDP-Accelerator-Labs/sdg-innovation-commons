The Cincinnatus Institute of Craftsmanship is a initiative by businessman and IT professional Chris Corcino and his wife Dalisa Heredia. Their project began as a free programming skills course in a local school. The couple then were allowed to transform the school curriculum and customize it for students to learn conmputer programming by the time they finish high school. Then, at the institute, they recruit youth from this school and from other underserved communities and train them for 1-2 years. If they become proficient, they are offered a job at Corcino's IT software development company, which provides outsourcing services to different companies in the USA. This project is mostly funded by the Corcinos.  The institute has been featured in the media and recognized by several gov't institutions for its work to promote a generation of programmers who can make a good living and bring their families out of poverty.
