As the saying goes “health is wealth” the reduction in suicide among with will definitely have a positive effect in the economy in the sense that we the youth have more energy ,fresh ideas and so we believe if we can educate our family youth about how important they are in the Zambian economy make them understand that they are a key element and also encourage or help them start up business personally I am an economist am perusing a Bachelor of Arts in economics at the university of Lusaka with the little knowledge I’ve obtain so far I do understand the economy hence why we want to start this program. Apart from that we want to also encourage them to boost their talents this will definitely impact Zambia’s financial market positively.

It is designed in such a way that We will be communicating  with the youth through social media,also go into schools and markets key factor is unleashing their talents

> Anticipated Social Impact

Well this innovation will definitely change lives most of us youths really find it challenging to open up but we sat and did an analysis this innovation will drive youths to protect their mental youth ,our emphasis is on them making sure to be kept busy by improving their talents which will drive them into entrepreneurship example given braiding of hair instead of one sitting thinking she’s nothing because her parents don’t have money she could start braiding hair if at all that’s her talent ,how ever in the long run we would start helping them raise funds to start up their businesses this will help in kwacha circulating within our country causing the decrease in the cost of living because the focus will be on revenue and not consumption.
