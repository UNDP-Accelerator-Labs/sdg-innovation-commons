(Em)Powering Women Through Access to Renewable Energy
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that access to energy in Guinea-Bissau is currently available to only 35.76% of the population, with the majority residing in the capital, Bissau. Rural areas, however, face significant challenges, with little to no reliable energy sources. This disparity is exacerbated by the country's underdeveloped infrastructure, further limiting energy access and usage. Energy access is essential for the health and well-being of the population in Guinea-Bissau. In particular, the lack of energy significantly impacts women's domestic labour, creating severe health risks. Therefore, this project aims to provide clean energy to women in the Cacheu Region, empowering them through economic activities facilitated by reliable energy access.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Cacheu region constitutes 14.3% of Guinea-Bissau’s national territory, covering 5,174.9 km²,
and is the fourth-largest regional area in the country. It comprises seven administrative sectors
(Bigene, Bula, Caió, Cacheu, Canchungo, Calequisse, and São Domingos), six of which are officially
recognized (Cacheu, Canchungo, Caió, Bula, Bigene, and São Domingos). There are 29 sections
(25 recognized), 154 communities, and 755 localities within the region. According to the region's
strategic plan for sustainable development (PEDSR 2021-2025), Cacheu has 199,674 inhabitants,
with a female population of 104,403 and a male population of 95,271. The main ethnic groups
include Manjacos, Balantas, Mancanhas, Mandingas, Fulas, Felupes, Papeis, Banhuns, Cobianas,
Mansoncas, Nhomincas, and Bijagós. The renewable energy project aims to intervene in six
localities (Cobiana, Djopa, Banhinda, Mata, Poilão de Leão, Djenden), impacting a population of
3,126 people, with 1,605 men and 1,521 women. 

In Cacheu, women play a crucial role in the local economy but often face significant barriers to
education, employment, technical and professional skills and resources1. Therefore, the first output
is through introducing solar photovoltaics will not only provide access to electricity but also create
economic opportunities, promoting women's empowerment and autonomy. This photovoltaic energy
project focuses primarily on female empowerment, addressing access to clean electricity and the
environmental, social, and economic empowerment of the communities within the Tarrafes do Rio
Cacheu Natural Park (PNTC). Nearly 100% of households in the targeted localities lack any form of
electricity network, with few exceptions such as the régulos’ residences in Mata and Cobiana, and
a shop in Poilão de Leão, which have precarious solar systems. The rest of the houses in these
villages have no electricity supply systems. The project aims to empower women in the PNTC
communities by installing, managing, and maintaining photovoltaic solar energy systems, thereby
improving access to electricity and creating economic opportunities for them.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab will explore, map, and test solutions to help Cacheu women develop economic activities based on their current practices. This will ensure the project's sustainability through innovative methodologies such as design thinking, collective intelligence, system mapping, and futures thinking, fostering creativity, entrepreneurship, and sustainability through improved renewable energy.


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



The Accelerator Lab is set to empower Cacheu women by exploring and testing solutions for sustainable economic activities. Using innovative methods like design thinking, collective intelligence, and system mapping, we'll boost creativity, entrepreneurship, and renewable energy!

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



If women in rural communities in Cacheu are given access to renewable energy and their capacities are enhanced, this will provoke a domino effect. They will have access to energy efficiency models and options, allowing them to divert their energy and productivity towards economic activities facilitated by solar energy. This, in turn, can be invested in improving social structures such as schools, hospitals, safer jobs, and environmental preservation for future generations, and decreasing the use and dependence on other harmful sources of energy. Additionally, this learning cycle serves as a pilot initiative that aims to catalyse the scale-up of interventions to improve access to modern energy at a national level. By ensuring that women have access to renewable energy and economic opportunities, the project envisions a future where gender inequalities are reduced, and the overall well-being of communities is enhanced.
