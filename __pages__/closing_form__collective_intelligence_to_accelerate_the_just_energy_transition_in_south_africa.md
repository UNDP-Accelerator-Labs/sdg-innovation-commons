## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. 56.7% of respondents had not heard about the JET, and 69% of respondents heard about the JET for the first time from the Youth Agents participating in this project. This indicates low levels of awareness despite the JET being discussed across numerous platforms, including mainstream media.


2. Though there were low levels of awareness of JET, only 11.5% of respondents had not heard about climate change, possibly indicating that awareness campaigns and media over the last few years have had an impact. 


3. Pointing to the complexity of this issues, 81.7% of respondents indicated that they were worried about climate change, while later 72% expressed that coal is not a problem for the country. 


4. Only 33.2% of respondents said that they would move from the area should the mines shut down. When asked if they had to move to find work, 30.5% indicated that they would move to Mpumalanga (a coal mining area). 


5. When asked which other sector they would want to work in, the top listed sector was ‘Electric Vehicles’ with 18.3% of respondents choosing this sector. Though electric vehicles are a key part of the JET Investment Plan, this industry does not exist as yet in South Africa and will take many years to build. The sector which was second in preferences was ‘Agriculture’ with 16.3% of respondents choosing this. Agriculture is seen as a key sector that needs to transition through JET, and will likely not generate sufficient job opportunities to absorb workers from the coal value chain.


6. When asked what would make it difficult to find a new job, the top three listed reasons were level of experience (33.2%), age (23.1%), and level of education (8.7%). When asked what skills they would like to learn, the top skill noted by respondents was business skills. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

This work is now being scaled by the Accelerator Lab itself. The aim is to increase the number of respondents participating in the survey. This will improve the relevance of the data, increasing its chance of being utilized by policy making bodies.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Gaps being addressed - poor representation of the views/needs/thoughts of mine workers and mining communities in shaping JET policies. 


The data types chosen were best suited to raising the voices of mine workers and surrounding communities. Interviews and engagement methods easy for communities to relate to, and conveys messages directly and simply. When designed correctly, they can gather data in a manner that conveys strong messages. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective Intelligence helps to raise, gather and analyze the voices of those who traditionally cannot or do not participate in policy making forums.
