> Brief description of the innovation

Sustainable transport has become a major concern across the globe and Zambia is no exception, 80% of rural Zambia with over 1.6 million small scale farmers have little to no standard form of transportation, to move produce to and from the market they rely on their heads, backs, manual bicycles and hired trucks, this causes high uncaptured produce value through the inability to reach bigger distant markets and loss of produce in storages due to the limited transport capacity.
Despite shear challenges the transport ecosystem in Zambia is quiet unique and that is why we have developed our Off-Road Solar Powered Electric Cargo Bike to cater to local conditions, it fits in where a bicycle is limited in its capacity and motor vehicle can be replaced. Our Ebike Cargo is 100 % powered by the sun, taking up to 6 hours to fully recharge and providing a 90km operating range at 250 kg load. Our bikes are built for rural off road environments at a low production and operating cost enabling high numbers of purchases and rentals among small scale farmers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our bikes will be sold at a hire purchase price of k12,000 in a space of twelve months, we shall provide solar powered recharge services for free during the hire purchase period to the customer, after the settlement of the purchase we shall offer instant discharged-recharged battery swaps at our solar charge station for K250 per month with free technical support.
Our target market are small scale farmers in rural areas and also delivery and courier service companies in urban areas, our innovation enables other product based business to increase their revenue by adding delivery services as their revenue stream. Additionally, our innovation allows micro logistic entrepreneurs with limited capital and capacity to start bigger business operations with our bikes as they slowly per for them.
The prize will enable us to set up our first commercial charge station and produce 5 electric cargo bikes. We are expecting to increase the number of produced bikes to 35 before the end of 2022, our bikes are fully powered by solar and with 35 Carbon neutral vehicles being used as an alternative form of transport we shall reduce the Carbon dioxide emissions by 120 metric tons in a year.

> Technical Feasibility

Our prototype is a conversional bike that has been converted into a hybrid bike allowing electric powered movement as well as manual powered movement depending on the user’s choice. We have upgraded an ordinary bicycle with an electro-mechanical kit that we developed. 
The Electro-mechanical components consist of a throttle, speed controller, battery pack and a motor, the bike is 100 % charged by the sun, taking 6 hours to fully charge and providing a 90 km operating range at 250 kg load, the bike can achieve top speed of up to 87k/h but for safety purposes it is limited to 45 k/h top speed.
We shall implement our pilot charging station for operational tests in Lusaka and move to scale in small scale farming dense areas of rural Zambia with the sale of the first five bikes that we shall produce in the first quarter of next year, the charging station shall be a mine solar farm consist solar panels and small housing for the recharging batteries.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation shall allow traders and farmers move their produce in larger quantities to bigger and faster markets that they cannot reach with the current forms of transport used, and it will also reduce cost for delivery and courier service businesses as our bikes operates at half the operating cost of petrol powered forms of transport.
Additionally, our innovation enables other product based business to increase their revenue by adding delivery services as another revenue stream. Furthermore, our innovation allows micro logistic entrepreneurs with limited capital and capacity to start bigger business operations with our bikes as they slowly per for them.
