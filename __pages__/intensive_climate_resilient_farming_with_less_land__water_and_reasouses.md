> Brief description of the innovation

I was trained in aquaculture, things like construction of fish ponds, growing fish and consultancy, but I was always looking for a way to make it better. So I researched the internet and found out about better farming methods, methods that didn't get affected by the environment and in turn didn't affect the environment. And that's how I began my project with the goal of feeding people at the same capacity as today( or even higher) but with less reasouses spent due to our current circumstances with the climate crisis. With our current farming practices we are at the mercy of our changing world as things like floods and droughts can easily disrupt our sources of food. Not only that but some of our farming methods are no good, an example would be the distraction of Forrest covered areas to find land for livestock or plantations. Farming practices like the ones I just outlined can easily be out done buy methods such as vertical farms. So basically that's what I want to tackle I'd like to embark on a farming venture involving indoor farming and vertical farming, primarily starting with fish farming in a controlled environment.e.g warehouses or any large building.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The economic value of this project is very high. Due to the fact that my primary commodity (fish) is highly sought after in my country. Infact there is currently a fish deficit in Zambia, especially when fingerlings (small fish ) are no longer readily available for farmers in the colder months. The market for my product exists and it's big, and when it comes to other people they will also empowered this is a farm after all its going to need many employees. In one wearhouse I would have more than one hundred tanks all filled with fish that need feeding and attention so many people will be employed. My target market isn't specific all places from local markets, butcheries and even supermarkets are all on the list. Currently I'm working slowly any setbacks are mostly financial, all of my funding for the one unit I have constructed have been from my family. While I'm grateful at this rate it'll take several years before I'm a competitor on the market. If I were to be considered for funding I could get myself and my project out there faster.

> Technical Feasibility

I've designed my fish growout tanks to be self contained, they don't have contact with the outside world like ponds do so things like diseases and pests are not a factor. I used ibc food grade tanks so I'd be able to grow my fish indoors so whether and climate are not factors to consider. I've built a prototype as the pictures show, some ask me how many fish can one tank hold is a pond not better? Well one tank holds 100 fish so with only 30 tanks I'd be able to equal the holding capacity of one 20 by 30 meter pond and I've done it with less space. If I'm funded I'd buy more tanks each costing k2000 built a structure to work in and start a company. I'll deal in fish production and processing as well as consultancy and training, I'm able to say this with confidence because I've been trained at mwekera under a government program.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I expect to undertake a large project that will need all sorts of people, from people to help with with running the farm to those I will train to become consultants and trainers. Even people who didn't undergo circular education will have an opportunity because some tasks don't take any specialization, example feeding or processing fish. Woman will also participate because this is not as labour intensive as digging a pond, its as easy as pipes, tanks and pumps.
