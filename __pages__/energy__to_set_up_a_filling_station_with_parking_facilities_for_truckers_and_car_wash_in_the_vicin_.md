> Title of the innovation

Energy: To set up a filling station with parking facilities for truckers and car wash in the vicinities of the new Mwenda-Kasomeno road and bridge linking  Zambia and the DR Congo across the Luapula river in Mwense district

> Brief description of the innovation

We aim to set up a filling station business with Car wash and parking lot for heavy-duty trucks in the vicinities of the Congo DR boarder somewhere between the Mulundu-Kashiba stretch of the Mwense-mansa road. This is a strategically suitable point in view of the planned construction of the bridge across the Luapula river to link Zambia and the DRC 
It's well speculated to cater for the expected growth in trade volumes and business activities between the two countries once the bridge is completed. The expected increase in traffic will no doubt place an unequivocally high demand for energy and parking space/ traffic leisure points
A filling station facilitated with accompanying services such as restaurant, air fills and car washing will be an ideal and sustainable venture
Plans for the future should include making the facility an intern and training ground for out of school or college students where they will be sharing ideas on ways to grow the energy sector with alternatives to fossil fuels
There are many be environmentally friendly filling station design prototypes to choose from on the market and which are

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

There will be increased traffic due to both intra national and international trade among countries of the East Africa and southern africa regions once the Mwenda- Kasomeno bridge and road is commissioned. Thus there will be a sales boost in fuel products and other mechanized services. Many young people will employed as fuel sales attendants, car washers, restaurant waiters, watchmen and mechanics. It will provide apt convenience to long distance travellers to lay by and refuel before proceeding. Existing businesses of agro products in the area will experience growth with the chance of many new others springing up. With trucks parked in our yard their drivers would in turn require places to sleep and this will be a plus to the hospitality industry.
The major environmental boost to this will be that many young people will be made to seek for new opportunities other than fishing. There will likely be a shift from old farming approaches to new ones that are more environmentally friendly be aimed at increasing production to feed growing populations. We have in mind fish farming in fish ponds

> Technical Feasibility

The design of this innovation for the filling station should be modernized and we'll fitted with the necessary technological accessories to make it more environmentally friendly. We believe there re many prototypes to choose from especially on the Japanese market 
These are cheaper and more cost saving compared to the old types. 
This innovation can be set up on a 1×1hectare land which should be customarily be negotiated for with the local chiefs.
There will be need for a reliable source of water and electricity, possibly solar. The should also have ablution facilities wit good drainage. This may require some paving works and a security wall fence
The station should have pressure pumps for petrol, diesel and gasoline with ancillary shelter for air pump.
There should also be a shelter with compartments for office, grocery store and restaurant or cafe.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Since this is a rural environment the immediate impact is going to be seen in the local people's reaction and adaptation to a new culture owing to new arrivals in terms of fashions, language, knowledge, skills and technology all of which will enhance lots of positive change in mind sets. 
The innovation will contribute to new constructions of housing facilities to cater for passers-by and indeed the new workers with their earned incomes
There will also be a promotion of new ideas in the area of health with an expected call for more and improved health facilities to effectively monitor the health of people moving across borders. The forward linkages will make it safe for people to park their vehicles and rest assured they will be healthy.
The innovation will provide a suitable market for oil tankers transporting fuel from east africa to the Congo DR. It will provide convenient access to area residents, travellers and the motoring public for easier and cheaper sources of fuel considering Mwense district has only got one small filling station which is the only one on the long route from Mansa to Nchelenge
