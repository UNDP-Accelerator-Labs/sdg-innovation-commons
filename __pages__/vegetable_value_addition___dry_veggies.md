> Brief description of the innovation

Am a farmer based in chongwe, I grow vegetables such as tomatoes, cabbages and onions. I noticed market for veggies in Zambia is a challenge, this meant that once the veggies have been harvested, as a farmer i was at the mess of the vendors or cadres who could dictate whatever price. This was a blow because when you decline to give them a cut, you wont sale and your fresh veggies will go bad. 
I ventured into drying the veggies in different ways and this include, sun-drying, heat dehydration. i dry varieties starting with tomato mixed veggies, chili byte veggies, onion ready to cook veggies etc. I package them and sell via facebook to international and local customers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Looking at the way climate change has hit the world, we may not have the pleasure of enjoying fresh foods in the future. Dry foods will take over and become a new normal just like the way covid has changed things. Preservation of dry foods will be much easier and cheaper for us to save the planet than storing fresh foods. Am looking at the technology that will boost my business to produce on commercial standard dry foods, both cereals and carbs to export to international and overseas market. Since i started this business of sun-drying veggies, i have recieved numerous appreciation from overseas clients who have been buying from me. 
This business will generate revenue for the country if we start exporting these products to international market. Research has shown that Dry foods are better and have a longer shelf life as compared to  fresh foods.

With this project supported, sensitization to the people will be very important to enable them understand how much energy we can save if we buy and eat dry food. Every household wont see the need for Refrigerators, as result, reducing load on the national electricity grid, making the government channel that saved energy to heavy industrial business.

The list is endless.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation in the current state used natural heat from the sun and firewood heat. This is so because the cost of buying a dehydrator, or a production plant from china was costing me, USD 85000 FOB price. To find that money in our current economy is like asking a Carmel to pass through the eye of a needle unless sponsors or grant is given.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will improve lives of the needy, through creation of both direct and indirect job. Farmers who will be supplying will have liquidity in their pockets, and value addition which will then push in some pay-as-you-earn to governemnt.
