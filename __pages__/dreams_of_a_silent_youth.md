DREAMS OF A SILENT YOUTH

> Brief description of the innovation

We aim at building a sustainable  youthful and elderly cities and communities by providing training, Mentorship and business skills to our immediate citizenory.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Well this is a dream about a better self sustaining cities and communities.Hence we wish to start our works with the office of the local governments,we believe through community development funds ,we can utilize that and buy required materials for different skills training.
Alternetively moving forward will attract other institutions to come on board.

> Technical Feasibility

First of all we seek to recognize the laws of the land.This is not just for a particular city or community but a national innovation, which will begin with a selected number of cities then be able to expand as we move.Will wish to bring the attention of the government as well as the private sector to this innovation which will amecably provide sustainability in our cities and communities.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Sustainability is what we intend to provide and are working towards.Every person has a talent , strengthen ,a goal and targets.Our innovations looks at these aspects, people have talents which we intend to realize.We want people to realize their talents,is it writing , singing, cooking ,as low as these are being looked at the are a greatest weapon in transforming lives of people,we have seen and heard stories of how people's lives have changed through music ,book writing,and the story we hear is I didn't have money or someone to make me realize my dreams in time,we wish to be that which will enable our youths as well as elders realize their wonderful talents on time.We have Alot of talented people in our commuties.we have realized that Alot of enable men and women have been left out maybe because they don't have background of school but is it their fault no, economic or financial aspects hindered the education,hence skill is all the have , talents but still someone has to come to their aid.

Youth empowerment programs,we have looked into these aspects, unluck the way it was done where on people belonging to particular government would be allocated,Us an innovation we look forward to working with the ministry of youths ,once we tap talents ,mentor ,educate or give skills to people will group these people , write to the ministry as well as other cooperating bodies and we'll wishers from the private sector to empower these people and also be able to check the development of these groups,we want to develop people ,grow our community , with every help we can get,we believe together will make a better environment for life of our people.

Mentally, physically, monetary and spiritually because it's only possible with God by our side.

Hopefully we will be able to help someone out there , and be able to create cities and communities that are sustainable and health. 

Moving forward we picture us being the center of skilled, talented and sustainable people ,will work with everyone to ensure all are catered for and help.
We are proud to be part of this innovation and we are seeking to be apart of creating cities and communities that are sustainable,

Thank you sincerely
