> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

My Name is Keita Barca, I have decided to redesign mine because of the transportation of water packs during what, with the old version let's say the normal one, I suffered alot. it was like dacing tango with the water in movement and also during high traffic, I waste while waiting for cars to go before moving. Now with my solution holds the packs and it can carry a total of 6 packs.
