> Title of the innovation

farming application

> Brief description of the innovation

Agriculture is the principle means of livelihood for a majority of rural households in Zambia. About 84% of these farm households entirely depend on agriculture. While there have been some improvements in agriculture production diversification and cash cropping in the late 1990s, small and medium scale farmers still constitute the largest group in income poverty in the country
The agriculture sector provides livelihood to about 90% of Zambia’s rural population and making them vastly vulnerable to extreme weather associated with climate change.
To support the agriculture sector, government has launched new reforms, schemes and policies. New techniques and inventions are made to help the agriculture domain, yet the information cannot be reached to farmer. The trouble comes in the dissemination of this information. Though data is available in the printed media, audio and visual forms, newspaper, internet, etc. the solution to curb this problem is the usage of a smartphone.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

the innovation idea will help the Zambian government in disseminating information to farmers faster and in a cheap way. the innovation idea will cut down the time it takes for information to reach farmers by 90% and cost by 80%. the target market for my innovation is the Zambian farmers in the rural areas and also the ministry of agriculture as we as the the ministry of livestock and fisheries.  the innovation it will bring to farmers is that it will keep farmers update to date from weather forecast to crops without them getting to travel farmers cost will be cut down by 20%.

> Technical Feasibility

Information and communication have always mattered in agriculture. Ever since people have grown crops, raised livestock, and caught fish, they have sought information from one another. What is the most effective planting strategy on steep slopes? Where can I buy the improved seed or feed this year? How can I acquire a land title? Who is paying the highest price at the market? How can I participate in the government’s credit program? Producers rarely find it easy to obtain answers to such questions, even if similar ones arise season after season. Updated information allows the farmers to cope with and even benefit from these changes. Providing such knowledge can be challenging, however, because the highly localized nature of agriculture means that information must be tailored specifically to distinct conditions It is in the context of globalizing agriculture where the need for information becomes most brilliant. The smallholders, who still provide a significant portion of the world’s food, need information to advance their work just as much as industrial-scale producers. Comparing the two types of farmers, industrial and small-scale, exemplifies the latter’s disadvantages. Where wealthier industrial producers can use the Internet, phone, weather forecasts, other digital tools, and technologies as simple as vehicles and infrastructure as basic as electricity to glean information on prices, markets, varieties, production techniques, services, storage, or processing, smallholders remain dependent primarily on word of mouth, previous experience, and local leadership. I Zambia there is a big gap when it comes to information between the ministry of Agriculture and their stakeholders. Firstly, it costs a lot of money and it also takes a lot of time for information to be delivered and it is even worse for the ministry of agriculture to get feedback from the farmers and other stakeholders.
The development of the farm app will bridge the financial gap and the period it takes for farmers to get the information. The ministry of agriculture depends on extensions officers to deliver information.
