## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Setting up plastic waste separation system in Telavi
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to assist Telavi - a major regional center in Georgia -  to set up a plastic waste separation system to reduce plastic pollution and support its transition towards a circular economy. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Last year, Accelerator Lab Georgia successfully run a behavioral experiment to nudge citizens' behavior to separate plastic waste at the source. The experiment was implemented in two major Georgian cities - Tbilisi and Batumi. Based on the results, the lab was asked to scale up and further expand the experiment in another city - Telavi. The idea to expand the experiment is driven by the belief that a sustainable waste management system is a community-specific project and no ready-made solutions should be applied straight away. The initiative belongs to the EU and UNDP joint project on private sector competitiveness and Telavi municipality.   Telavi is one of the major regional centers of Georgia with a population of 20 000 people. Currently, there is no waste separation infrastructure there, although the city is covered by a municipal waste management plan, as required by the National Strategy on Waste Management, which, in turn, is largely linked to the EU association agreement. In general, it is estimated that Telavi residents have low levels of awareness regarding waste separation practices. Besides, no prior experience in waste separation in the area was identified.

The amount and morphology of the household waste is largely unmonitored in Georgia. Concequently, there is no exact data on how much reusables end up in the landfills in Georgia. However, according to Tbilisi City Hall, in 2020 Plastic comprised 15% of total municipal waste, which amounted to up to 57 000 tones per year in total or 51 kg per person per year. Concidering that Tbilisi is a major economic center with the highest average wages (13_xelpasi_wliuri_regioni.xlsx (live.com)), we can assume it has the highest purchasing power that contributes to the amount of plastic waste. In Kakheti, where Telavi is located, on the other hand, the wages are twice as small as in Tbilisi, we might expect less plastic waste as population might not be purchasing much plastic-related products.   Additionally, during the experiment in Tbilisi and Batumi, the lab collected 1.8 tones of plastic in 8 weeks by using only 40 containers. In the control groups of Tbilisi and Batumi, we collected 0.046 KG and 0.015 PET plastic per resident respectively. We can conclude that there is a huge potential for plastic recycling industry and introduction of the circular economy concept.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Using behavioral science and spatial design to set up a plastic waste separation system for the entire city is a truly experimental project in Georgia. The experts are still skeptical regarding the waste separation in general and spatial design is non existent at the municipal level. The lab is well placed to connect all the stockholders and, more importantly, has professional experience in dealing with system change. There is no other agency with similar set of skills and connections.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What is the best communication message and spatial arrangement of the bins in Telavi to achieve efficient plastic waste collection?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will need to understand how the existing municipal waste containers are used by the population and what attitudes do they have towards plastic waste separation. Based on the spatial analyses and ethnography, we should be able to suggest any improvements in the system to make sure the waste disposal by the residents as well as the waste pick-up by the authorities is easy. Based on RCT outcomes, we will elaborate the communication campaign to nudge citizens to separate plastic waste. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no baseline information regarding plastic waste collection in Telavi, therefore we will create an actionable evidence to design a full-scale community-specific waste management system.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The project can be replicated in all mid-size Georgian cities and provide a insights for the national waste management authorities.
