> Title of the innovation

Solar irrigation system

> Brief description of the innovation

Climate change has become one of the challenging factor in Agriculture in Zambia and it is because of this we want to come up with a borehole and a solar irrigation system installed in case we don't have enough rains in a particular year, And the other thing is we want to be farming the whole year round to eliminate shortages of food and income.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As we all know agriculture is business that's the reason we want to take it seriously and not only depending on rains. For the first time will try source funds from lending institution and contribution from our members, From there the same project will be able to fund itself from the products which will grown and sold.

> Technical Feasibility

We do seasonally farming from there we keep our small money trying to raise funds for the borehole and for the solar irrigation system kit.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Once we expand we will be able to employee people around us that will be job creating...And since will be doing farming the whole year round will have enough farm products to sell to the market because at the moment we have shortages of food at the market.
