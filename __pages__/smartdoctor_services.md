> Title of the innovation

SmartDoctor Services

> Brief description of the innovation

SmartDoctor is a free online application which will enable citizens to get medical advice and also call any available doctor near them to provide home care Services when medical attention is needed at affordable costs. We also want to provide employment to doctors as many of them have remained unemployed as a result of low employment rates in the country.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The initiative will generate revenue through charging commission on every bill for a user. The initiative will help reduce the current doctor-patient ratio of 1 doctor for every 12,000 patients as a result of the health care centers which are understaffed. The patients will get quick medical attention as the services will be home health care services. Currently, a patient takes about 5 hours to be fully attended to at the hospital but our system will be able to offer solution to this and also reduce avoidable deaths which we have witnessed due to patients being attended to when it’s too late. Our services will be affordable by majority citizens compared to the high medical fees currently being charged. Our targeted customers are citizens in Zambia, especially those with access to smart phones and internet and also the physicians who have been unemployed for a long time. The challenge prize will help as start working on the application and also meet our financial and business goals such as to pay for office space, pay the system developer, buy furniture, computers and to also meet our advertising costs. We will promote good health and well-being.

> Technical Feasibility

This will be an online application which will require doctors to register with SmartDoctor to be added or approved on to the platform after subscribing. We will map the areas the physicians will reside from in order to have a directory of physicians in every area. A patient will be able to search for a doctor near them to seek medical attention. We intend to also subscribe certain health care centers to offer ambulance services during emergencies.  We are intending to reduce Doctor-patient-ratio and offer improved &amp; affordable medical care. Once we find funding, the proposed implementation plan is has follows;
Quarter 1 (2022):
•	Start developing the application.
•	Go live with application (Business begins)
•	Get office space
Quarter 2 (2022):
•	Secure strategic alliances with medical personnel
Quarter 3 (2022):
•	Secure strategic alliances with 5 medical centers
Quarter 4 (2022):
•	Have a meeting with all stakeholders.
•	Launch tour marketing campaign 
Quarter 1 (2023):
•	Open branches in other areas
•	Engage more medical personnel
Quarter 2 (2023):
•	Add more medical services on our application
Quarter 3 (2023):
•	Increase marketing campaign
•	Open more branches
Quarter 4 (2023):
•	Increase marketing campaigns around our services because we project to have competitors by this time

> Anticipated Social Impact

Health care service delivery is not good in Zambia and the services are not affordable to majority citizens. Basic medical consultation costs $15 per patient per doctor visit. Health care centers are few and they are also far from residential areas. Health Centers Countrywide are understaffed with Doctor-patient-ratio at 1 doctor for every 12,000 patients. On average, it takes about 8 hours for a patient to be fully attended to and we have experienced high levels of avoidable deaths as a result. Over 10,000 physicians graduate each year and the country has low employment rate. To help address these problems we have created SmartDoctor, a free online application which will enable citizens to get medical advice and also call any available doctor near them to provide home care Services when medical attention is needed. We also want to provide employment to doctors in the process.
