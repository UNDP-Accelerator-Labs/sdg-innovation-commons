> What is the estimated total cost to reproduce this solution?

around 2000$

> What components/materials are needed to reproduce this solution?

Specific high-voltage solar panels, a 3-phase 240V centrifuge water pump (low head, high flow rate) with 2 horsepower, a solar pump inverter, a tailor-made trailer, and accessories are some of the items available on the market, while others are tailor-made or purchased under special orders. Several components are imported, and some are manufactured locally.

> Are these components/materials easily accessible locally or do they need to be imported?

Training is required for the manufacturing/assembly team, which needs to be competent in several areas such as pumping, electricity, solar, and hazards. Initial in-person training is highly recommended, followed by supportive materials such as videos and documentation, which can transfer most of the know-how and help in troubleshooting issues.

> Are there technical prerequisites, tools or infrastructure to implement this solution? (For example, is access to a power source or the Internet required?)

Training is required for the manufacturing/assembly team that has to be competent in several areas (pumping, electricity, solar, hazards). Initial in-person training is highly recommended then supportive (videos, documentation) matertrial can transfer most of the know-how and trouble-shooting issues.

> Is replicating this solution a task suited to a single person or does it require a group or team effort?

This is a group effort that requires individuals with diverse skills and the engagement of the local supply chain. Local welding specialists and workshops, for example, can play a significant role in manufacturing the trailer.

> Is there documentation available, such as written guides, videos, or other forms, illustrating the process of assembling the solution and performing routine maintenance?

There is some initial information that we used to describe the innovation and promote it to various stakeholders. Further knowledge transfer is required to address the depth of technical details and specifications of various components, assembly, best practices, and operation.

> Is there an online support service or resource available to help users or their organizations implement the solution?

While there are manuals for each component supplied by the manufacturer, they are rather generic and do not address the specificity of this application, which is quite different from the common industrial application of these components.

> Are there any regulatory policies or procedures to consider when replicating this solution?

There are no specific policies that directly limit this application; however, local customs might affect the overall pricing based on the customs levies on solar components.

> What special precautions should be taken when maintaining this solution?

The product has been designed from the ground up with uneducated farmers in mind as the key end-users. The design, operation, and maintenance are very robust and user-friendly. Key components (specifications and troubleshooting) are optimized and critically selected to ensure longevity and ease of maintenance. Ensuring that solar panels are not broken or damaged is the main concern

> Is this solution designed to be accessible to women and seniors?

The product is non-discriminatory towards end-users and can empower a variety of user groups, especially the base of the pyramid of small farmers across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

> Is the Solution Owner willing to spend significant time and effort in Q1 and Q2 2024 to collaborate with UNDP Accelerator Labs in the process of documenting and designing a solution plan?

> Please acknowledge: The collaboration between the Solution Holder and the UNDP Accelerator Lab does not imply any financial commitment or offer from UNDP. Furthermore, UNDP assumes no legal or financial liability which may or may not arise from the pre-project design work in relation to the expansion of the energy solution. The selection of energy solutions is based on their open source nature and lack of intellectual property protection, depending on the solution owner. The Solution Owner represents to UNDP Accelerator Lab that all information provided is accurate to the best of its knowledge and belief. The Solution Owner acknowledges its responsibility for the Solution and undertakes not to hold UNDP liable for any potential collective claims, whether monetary or non-monetary, that may arise from its sharing and use with third parties. The solution owner also expressly confirms that the solution in question is open source and does not violate any existing intellectual property rights. UNDP and its partners reserve the right to involve relevant national organizations/institutions to validate the open source nature of the solution in question. The Solution Holder expressly commits to sharing their solution globally as a contribution to the UNDP Accelerator Labs “Discover and Deploy” energy campaign and open source innovation commons.
