> Title of the innovation

Agricultural and livestock; we wish to venture into this agro and livestock,due to the fact of having less white meat on market ,hence having this idea we need to rivamp production of village chickens and broilers for both local and international outlets

> Brief description of the innovation

As we allouded to that above,the deffencit of white meat is our eye opener,hence creating opportunity for us to venture into this less compatible business of more profits .we discovered this that village chickens are highly needed by everyone in each ones house's hold due to its test and moreover both whites and Zambian citizens have come to know the importance of having this white meat which has got less to no chemicals to activate it upon its growth.Therefore we need to increase the production of  our village chickens to use our morden facilities such as incumbertors to speed up the process of incubertion for us to cover up the numbers we need for this mass number we need to cover up our target.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

After our village chickens are grown ,customers will get white meat closer to their door steps hence creating more income for our innovation.then the suppluos can be for export eg into DRC Congo and Angola.Our eggs, white meat, birds , village chickens can all be expoted into this dimensions hence creating job opportunities to ourselves,job to our transpotors and to our final sellers at our final sells point into these nations namely Zambia, Congo and Angola.

> Technical Feasibility

At this moment  we need one thousands female village chickens and one hundreds male chickens for the mass production to start .two incubertors one thousands each's capacity.this will enable our project to produce about two thousands day old village chickens in every 21days and able to supply fertilesed eccess eggs to our local and export.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Other people can come and buy our fertilesed village chicken eggs for day old village chicken production (those who have incubertors )
