Renewable energy company Sunergise installed the largest solar system any marina in the world has had—in Port Denarau, Nadi, Fiji. Nadi receives ample sunshine hours, which makes the switch to solar energy an obvious move for the marina. It allows for significant savings and cleaner energy helps keep the environment pristine which is a key pull factor for tourists visiting or passing through the marina
