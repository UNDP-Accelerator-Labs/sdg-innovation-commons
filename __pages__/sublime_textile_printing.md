The story began when Anne Antah (the founder) produced hair accessories using the Kain Sarong found in the local market. She found it challenging in sourcing the correct fabrics and crafts that defined the local culture identity. Anne then began to research and study about the local cottage industry. She discovered the delights of many various ethnic groups that she had never heard of or known. 
In 2018, the first production and in-house textile brand produced by Chanteek Borneo hits the market, focusing on contemporary ethnic clothes making. Chanteek Borneo is the first local business in Sabah that produces contemporary ethnic designs for textile. Chanteek Borneo designs and prints textiles, with expertise on Sabah's ethnic motifs. 
Technology
The company uses dye-sublimation method to produce textile prints. Dye-sublimation is a technology to digitally print textiles whereby the designs are created by digital drawing and then printed on a transfer medium before heat printed on to the fabric.
