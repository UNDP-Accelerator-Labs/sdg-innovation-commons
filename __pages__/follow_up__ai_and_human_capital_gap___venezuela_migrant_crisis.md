## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. The initial prototype was developed based on initial conversations with several government institutions, where there was determined the need of a solution that could gather information to categorize the needs of migrant communities, then a service able to gather information on the offer of services from public and private institutions that could improve the integration of migrant communities, and a function to target the offer to the migrants and to follow the matchmaking process, that would result in the close of human development gaps of this communities.

2. We have already developed a web scrapping tool that gathers information from the two most used job search platforms in Colombia (Linked In and ElEmpleo.com), based on Python.

3. The version that is going to be developed in the next phase of the project is intended to allow the real time to follow up and assessment on the integration process that a given person has from the first service to which this person has access to. Based on the initial idea to improve job linkages, the platform to be developed is intended to integrate information from other services, for example health or education.

This conversation started in a joint effort with several institutions of the former government, such as the National Statistical Department (DANE), the ICT Ministry and the National Planning Department, with whom where stablish the first priorities of the platform and its initial concept. However the Border Management Office (which belongs to the office of the president) didn’t agree on the initial proposal.

After the change of government (between July and September 2022) the Migration Office (Migración Colombia) found the proposal of the platform highly valuable and agreed to work with UNDP on this project. However, the development phase has struggled with bureaucratic requirements to complete the resources transfer. The contract process of the development provider is ongoing (request for quotation) within UNDP.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The use of data sourced from web scrapping on job search portals, allows us to monitor the labor supply and demand, specially within vulnerable populations, to improve the job matchmaking of this communities. We also use the data gathered form the migrants that use the platform and other service providers.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Prototyping & human centered designed: Based on a characterization and understanding of our target group we will prototype in small scale what can be a possible solution that guarantee employment and economic development for migrants in Colombia. We have designed what we have called “Inclusive Employment Path (IEP)” 

Web scrapping: We can obtain data from employment websites. This technique will allows us to monitor the labor supply and labor demand. Our CO developed a web scraping tool using Phyton, with which we are able to read social networks such as LinkedIn and Elempleo.com (the most popular networks among job searchers in Colombia). 

Social understating: Using AI we aim to have a social understanding about our targeted group and their economic situation. We can identify which topics are the most talked about by the vulnerable population, which allows us to categorize their needs, the types of jobs they have, and several other factors that can be used to respond to different issues. This process can be done using IA tools such as Citibeats or Talkwalker, which allow us to organize people's opinions into insights, read trending topics and sentiment analysis
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Migración Colombia: This institution will take the lead on the use of the platform as a channel to follow up on the integration process of other communities. They are an independent entity linked to the International Relations Ministry in Colombia, and is responsible of supporting the development of migratory policy.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

NA

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
