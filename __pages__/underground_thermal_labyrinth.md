> Description of the solution

The Australian Plant Bank in New South Wales uses an underground thermal labyrynth to capture and return the heat of the day or the cool of the night, preventing sharp temperature fluctuations and warning or cooling the building by up to 7.5 degrees centigrade. It was designed by BVN Donovan Hill. Air is moved through the labyrinth, cooling down the 3 m high corrugated pre-cast concrete walls to the lowest night-time temperature. During the day, warm ambient air is ventilated into the labyrinth and is cooled as it comes in contact with the chilled walls. This air is then distributed into the Atrium. Warmer air in the Atrium is displaced and evacuated through vents in the ceiling.
