## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Throughout the process, we experimented with the possibility of leveraging a set of distinct capabilities to catalyze system transformation, particularly focusing on biowaste, that would reduce the amount of biowaste that end up in a landfill.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Primarily, we wanted to test if we can enable shifts in the prevailing narratives about biowaste. We were mostly interested in pursuing the narrative of biowaste as a valuable resource that could inspire the mobilization of the public, private and civil society sectors. The idea was to test if there is a possibility of creating a circular ecosystem and collective identity around biowaste. Core hypothesis: If we can shift the prevailing narratives around biowaste, then we can interest the public about biowaste as a valuable resource with transformational potential.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Six months

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

N/A

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Variety of data collection techniques, including: - city of Skopje waste audit - comparative analysis with EU countries, on bio-labs and their programs - desktop research on waste production

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

The entire Accelerator Lab team worked on this process, and dedicated at least 30% of their time in the period in question.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

We believe that we proved that there is a community, a nexus that can be activated between public institutions, academia, CSOs and champions to work together and transform bio-waste into valuable products. We also believe that we proved that there is a lot of bio-waste that ends up on landfills, and that some of that waste can be transformed in a lab into a product. Through our feasibility study of those products we also showcased that there is business potential in some of the bio-waste products as well.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Six months

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The process is planned to be continued in 2022

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

When we started this process, we didn't know a lot about the bio-lab movement in Europe, and its potential to grow in our city. We knew waste, particularly organic/bio-waste was an issue, but we weren't sure that this approach [bio-hacking-lab] and activating the nexus between academia/CSOs/ and public institutions would work.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Our city administration had elections last year, so that made it a bit more difficult for us to inform/organize activities with them.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity, because it showcases a 'white space'/ 'an intervention area 'in our community, that sparks interest among stakeholders, and at the same time - has not been explored thus far.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The business/academic communities had a particular interest in this process, because they can see the potential for the transformational power of waste.
