> Brief description of the innovation

Anmut Sur Moi Trading also known as Biogas Technology In Zambia is a woman-led construction company specialized in the construction of bio-digesters, a technology that uses waste to produce energy for cooking, heating, lighting and organic fertilizer for farming. After being employed for 4 years, my only passion was to put the knowledge I had gathered into action. On account of the huge problem of energy in Zambia, and the low affordability rate of Hydroelectric Power by peri-urban/informal settlements of Lusaka, the idea of weaving this gap was born.

According to USAIDZambia, more than 70% of Zambians spend averagely $780 annually on both firewood and charcoal for cooking/heating, meanwhile majority of these households are in the lowest income brackets, with a daily consumption of less than $1.90/person.

Biogas Technology is coming in as an alternative cheap source of energy by making use of waste which is processed into energy for cooking, heating and lighting.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1). Profitability - The technonolgy generates revenue from constructing biodigesters. Yearly, we spend $5,150 to construct at least 30 bio-digesters. Thus realizing $11,700 in total annual sales leads us to $6,550 total profit.  As such, our profit margin is 55.98%.

2). Target Market - Our target market are smallholder farmers keeping animals such as pigs, cows it chickens, communities with a problem of sewage and households with access to manure. 

3). The Challenge Prize - Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of households wanting to use biogas, but do not have the ability to construct one as most construction expenses are upfront. This has created an untapped needy audience in the rest of the country. As such, in 2 years, we hope to start packaging biogas to readily provide it as a cheaper option to construction. The Challenge Prize will help us introduce biogas portable bags.

4). Value Addition - Within a space of 4 weeks, we are capable of producing 56m3 of biogas consumed for cooking and lighting, equivalent to 26kg of Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinder (LPG). Our business' unique feature lies in its ability to produce gas and organic fertilizer entirely from manure.

> Technical Feasibility

We utilize manures from cattle, chicken and pigs, which we process into energy by anaerobic digestion, turning them into biogas, which contains both energy (gas), and valuable soil products (fertilizer). The biogas services are being provided through construction of bio-digesters, an underground fixed dome structure for waste accommodation.

Our implementation strategy involves working with marketing agents such as local radio stations, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, advertising on social media platforms such as our Facebook page (Biogas Technology In Zambia) and also conducting physical workshops coupled with site visits to already functioning plants to sell our products to clients that desire it. To maintain customers and build loyalty, we serve our market by providing quality products and excellent follow-up services.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The enterprise has benefited both small scale farmers and households by creating an alternative source of “green” energy for both rural and urban households. The enterprise has enabled more than 300 households to access modern energy services through the biodigester technology.

We are all currently integrating the SDGs into our works, thus ensuring continued action to achieve them. Our works focus on meeting: SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG1: No Poverty; SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 5: Gender Equality; 

Anmut Sur Moi Trading was established with an aim of providing a long term solution to tackle the problem of poor energy through the provision of affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, which is a clean and affordable cooking solution.
