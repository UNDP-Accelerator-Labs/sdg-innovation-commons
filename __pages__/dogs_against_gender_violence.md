## 

This solution was created by Andrea Mosquera who shared her experience in the Human Library event organized by Ecuador´s Acclab in January. Andrea is a woman with disability (cerebral palsy) who was assaulted in a park by a man who had followed her. When she was brought down to the floor, suddenly a dog approached them and barked insistently to the point that the attacker had to let her go. Her story: https://acclabecu.org/en/a-four-legged-hero/

From this experience, Andrea Funded ARNV (Non-violence Rapid Action), a foundation that trains street dogs to protect battered women who have a restraining order.
