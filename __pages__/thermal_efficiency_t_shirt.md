> Description of the solution

The Thermal Efficient t-shirt reduces the need for air conditioning. Materials Science Company LifeLabs developed a new generation of thermally efficient textiles. Weavers of the US Company Coollife-t-shirts experience a continual reduction of body temperature by three degrees Fahrenheit. The fabric is recycled, engineed polyethylene, a material that is transparent to infrared wavelengths, allowing heat to easily flow away from the wearer.
