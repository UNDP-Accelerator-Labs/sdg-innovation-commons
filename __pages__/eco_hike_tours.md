Started in 2020 during COVID-19 after internal lock-down restrictions were relaxed and a demand for outdoor activities. Catered initially to the local communities expanding to tourists when the borders reopened end of 2021. Business offers private hikes throughout the BVI, excursions to other islands and more recently coastal tours with the addition of kayaks and curated events e.g. bonfires using a contained portable bonfire pit. Promoted as an eco-friendly tour business: no plastics are used (all refreshments are served using reusable items such as mason jars and calabash bowls); existing trails are used and any trail enhancements are done with limited damage to surrounding vegetation; educational component encompassing history of trail and historical sites, discussion about native vegetation and wildlife and demonstrations of traditional agriculture practices (one tour includes visit to pineapple plantation).
