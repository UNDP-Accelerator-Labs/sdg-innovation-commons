Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT.  Language barrier acts as a limitation for communication among the tourists and the locals, as the local indigenous people speak a plethora of different tribal languages and the predominantly Bengali tourists speak Bangla. To address this challenge, language training could be provided for the local tour guides in collaboration with Bangladesh Tourism Board. The picture shows one such pilot training organized by the Accelerator Lab Bangladesh.
