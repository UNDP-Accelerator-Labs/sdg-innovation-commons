> Description of innovation

The air-conditioners used in building sector consumes about 40% of electricity generated. These systems consume high amounts of Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and energy. Cooling solutions should not warm the planet while cooling the environment. Ant Studio solves the issue of global warming via sustainable and inexpensive alternatives while consuming very little energy and no chemicals. Use of vernacular material reduces on embodied energy, use of passive energy strategies reduces environmental impact, and use of craft gives it a distinct character and encourages local employment by incorporating traditional craft and skills.  Cool Ant uses tradtional materials and passive design for design for cooling and air purification
