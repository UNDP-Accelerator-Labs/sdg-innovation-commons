## Title

Behavioural Insights for Youth Entrepreneurship
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge statement is to transform informal businesses into formal through behavioural insights in order to adress the fluctuating incomes and harsh conditions in the informal economy.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Due to the high unemployment rate in the country, majority of the Somali population depend on small informal businesses as their source of income. As such, the informal sector makes up a large portion of the local economy with a large quantity of the Somali youth and women engaged in this sector. Further, the sector receives limited support from the existing local authorities and access to financial capital remains almost nonexistent.

Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

So far, we are not aware any other entity working on the same while applying Behavioural Insights. Our initiative is more of an experiment where, upon completion, we intend to share our findings with other UNDP Somalia portfolios for acceleration. Also, the initiative is in line with UNDP Somalia's CPD priories as it's linked to the third major programme priority, namely Sustainable Natural Resources for inclusive Economic Growth.
