Intro
Different stakeholders have been engaged in the collecting, sorting, recycling of the waste in large cities in Azerbaijan, and, noticeably, the collection chain has been managed by the public services while sorting, and recycling has been done haphazardly by individuals and/or small-medium enterprises. It creates a hidden system of plastic recycling in the country, which is, on the other side, a shadow solution to plastic pollution that has evolved organically on the grassroots level.  To understand the entire cycle, Acclab has made several field visits and met the representatives at all stages.


Stats
Plastic waste, which is around 6% of the entire waste in Azerbaijan, causes significant environmental threats. According to the State Statistical Committee, the volume of household waste is 907. 3 ths m3 in the country and 204.8 ths m3 in Baku in 2018. However, the independent assessments show that the number of produced waste is much higher than that reported. To illustrate, it has been calculated that the amount of household waste is about 1684.1 ths m3, and the amount of waste per person is around 333 kg per year. In this regard, it is estimated that approximately 20-24 kg of plastic waste per year accounts per citizen in Azerbaijan.


Although the harmfulness of plastic waste has been recognized, in recent years the production and usage of plastic have increased significantly in the country. As evidence, the production of plastic has been doubled, and the import of plastic bags has increased five times. The amount of secondary polymer has risen by 700% between 2015 and 2018. 


Situation
Except for Baku, the collection of the waste is organized by the Cleaning Department of the Regional Executive Authorities. In the large cities except for Baku, there is no formal waste sorting process, and it has been sorted manually
by individuals across the city and in the landfill. Around 100 people are sorting waste in the city, and 30-40 people are doing it on the polygon. They are mostly looking for, so-called mild plastic, and don't collect PET plastic, which is used to make bottles for carbonated soft drinks.  A number of small and medium enterprises are purchasing politelen or other types of plastic except for PET plastic and reuse it for secondary production. 


This is the case of a grassroots solution to the problem, which has been solved by the community naturally.
