> Title of the innovation

Digital Competence Based Learning

> Brief description of the innovation

This is a movement aimed at advocating for positive change and enlightenment among the youths and women in shanty compounds.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target for positive development are vulnerable youths and women in our communities.
In Education, to engage educators at different levels of education (that is starting from early childhood education to tertiary level of education) in providing innovative, creative and interactive learning platforms such as written lessons, audio lessons, videos, video assignments and computer based learning.
In order for the project to attain it's targeted goals, there is need of new and modern equipment that can easily facilitate digital learning in 3D format or newly implemented technologies that have less difficulties such as HD cameras, condensed microphones and good running computers.

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype of the project is to enhance 
innovative and technological learning at all levels of education.
The project is based on the creation of innovative media and technological tools that facilitate digital learning, this is done through video recordings and audio recordings of educators ( teachers and lecturers) to facilitate their teaching in modern and interactive way and then these videos are then shared to pupils and students for more and deep understanding of topics.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Since Zambia is developing from analogue to digital migration it is important that people especially in the education sector are not left behind. The project therefore aims at advocating for innovative, technological and interactive learning platforms which also creates employment for the general public especially the youths in different areas of society.
Traditional modes of learning have proven not to be more effective in this era of technology as many students at different levels of education have come to embrace the new technology outside the education system such as the use of social  media hence, implementing such technologies in the education system would increase learners ability to learn in modern, interractive and effecient way.
