The innovation helps to control the spread of army worms in farms. The sprayer which is strapped on the back has six adjustable nozzles capable of spraying below the leaves of the maize crop, where the destructive crop hides during the day to escape direct sunlight. This hungry caterpillar feeds on several plant species but its preferred host is maize, a crop whose acreage is expanding faster than any other cereal as the demand for ugali and animal fodder increases. The pest presents a peculiar challenge as it can consume over 200 kilometers of crop during its adult stage, laying thousands of eggs along its way. Larvae burrow inside maize whorls or hide under the leaves, where they are partially protected from pesticides. The pump's rotating nozzles, which are adjustable, are located on each side of the sprayer and can be adjusted to spray directly inside the funnel, where the worm feeds, and the outside of the crop, where it hides. The sprayer is charged by a solar powered dynamo and when the solar power runs out, it uses a manual hand pump which serves as a backup.
