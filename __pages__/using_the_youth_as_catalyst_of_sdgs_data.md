## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Bridging the last-mile SDG data gap in local planning with youth engagement
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



our challenge is that there is information gap in the local development zone which hinders proper planning of development activities  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The history of the challenge is that there is no proper SDG progress reporting from the bottom up; the reporting of SDG achievement is done at a national and provincial level with no accurate reflection of last-mile progress. This means there is no last mile reporting on a local level from the communities affected by this development and such this data collection process is the first of its kind and involves a network of youth created by the UNDP with the help of Accelerator lab called Jerrod whose capacities are reinforced to be able to step into these communities and collect the relevant data. The driving force behind this is that to properly be able to support the government as developmental actors the right information needs to be used. The situation is that the government has never carried out such a study due to limited resources while the youth are eager to step in and fill in the gap for personal development purposes. By doing so, we hope to influence our programming practices by emphasizing the use of SDG-centric untapped data sources in our upcoming projects.

We are at the half way mark of 2030 AGENDA and the missing reflections of local SDG progress is fragilising the country planning of accelerating actions toward the agenda goals. Without last mile data all development efforts are done blindly without a linkage to real development challenges faced by those in need which fails to meet the leaving no one behind approach.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The unique value proposition the Lab is bringing to solve this challenge is the ability to act as the intergrator of the process between the youth network who are carrying out the data collection on ground and the UNDP decentralization project: using the Labs innovationive concepts and Agility:

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



DRC accelerator lab is supporting the acceleration of the 2030 agenda through Youth involvement in SDG local data collection. Development planning at the local level has flaws in reflecting the last-mile progress that this first-of-its-kind approach intends to cover 
## Challenge classification
## Partners

<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the partner:



UNDP Decentralization and local governance programs

Local governments: the governors are the sponsors of the data collection initiatives with Youth

National Ministry of Planning: involving local antennas to support the initiative

Universities in each province: guiding the youth selected and trained

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



This an ecosystem aiming at supporting the deployment of the data collection and its involve UNiversities providing guidance of Young student, the local governments providing all the necessary authorization and Ministry of planning providing technical support as beneficiary of data collection. This is a multilayers involvment into local development planning with the engagement of the youth on volontary basis

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We want to learn how effective will youth engagement contribute to filling up the gap of last miles SDG data collection for accurate local planning purposes;

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



 The methods such as prroof of concept being that such a study has never been done before with a pilot collecting last mile insights targeting 2 SDGs in 3 province of the DRC which can be used to raise funds to cover more provinces

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Development planning at the local level has flaws in reflecting the last-mile progress that this first-of-its-kind approach intends to cover. Therefore, governance at the local level is done with less accuracy in addressing people's aspirations and priorities in development planning. This data collection initiative is meant to trigger good practices in local governance related to SDG progress tracking and SDG-centric interventions
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Ministry of Planning and local governments are the tier 1 beneficiaries of this work
