## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Citizens Feedback App for Project Monitoring and Data Management
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that a third-part monitoring of project can help improve the delivery and also the effectiveness, accountability and transparency for donor reporting.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Too often third parties such as implementing partners and beneficiaries do not have a space or mechanism through which to report on for example the projects implemented by the UNDP for how they are contributing towards the desired outcomes, including capturing narratives of those who benefit from the implementation of such projects for evidence based reporting. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The reports from previous field missions including suggestions from implementing partners on how to improve reporting.


</div>


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">
