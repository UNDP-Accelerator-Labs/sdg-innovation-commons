> Title of the innovation

Soybeans cultivation for local and international market

> Brief description of the innovation

The project is aimed at supplementing the agriculture sector so as to improve the nutrition of the Zambians and southern Africa from the vast proteins present in soybeans, and also provide employment for the local youths looming the streets.
The project is set to be initiated in the 2021/22 farming season with an Hector. To plant an Hector, 100kg of soybeans is needed, and the breeds selected for increased yields are Spike from zamseed and Dina seed.
Other supplements are needed so at to increase the yield and profits these include, Mix A to increase the fertility of the soil, inoculant to increase the bacteria that helps the plants to fix nitrogen into the soil, 4×50kg of D compound fertilizer, 10ltrs of boosters, 5 ltrs of weed killer and labour for carrying out the needed work.
Soybeans takes 100-150 days to be ready for harvest after planting.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The estimated yields from an Hector if well maintained is 30-40 bags of 65kg bags of soybeans.
Talking figures, on the copperbelt, 1kg cost k12.50 and if I get 35 65kg bags this gives k28437.50 from a capital of k5000, thus realizing a profit of k22437.50 before government taxes are deducted.
The project is aimed at supporting health living through consuming of natural oils, providing employment to local youths, providing soybeans for making stock feeds and also eradicating malnutrition levels through production of soya porridge for infants and persons with compromised immunity.
With the prize money at hand, I can grow the production from cultivating an Hector to 100 hectors and also through irrigation, so as to keep the supply steady. A hundred hectors can require a capital of k50,000.00, which can yield a profit of k2.2m per harvest. 100 hectors can be worked by 150 workers with of course a basic pay of k 2500.
The net profit can be used to venture into fish farming and cooking oil production from soybeans.

> Technical Feasibility

The soybeans production project been proposed is scheduled to start this year's farming season with a capital of k5000, with a labor force of 5 youths from land preparation to harvest. With a pay of k2500 each after harvest.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Having grown the project to the level of irrigating the plants whole year round, the project will employ about 100 youths preferably per plantation. And if the project is implemented in more other selected districts along the line of rail, the employment will surely be increased proportionately.

The project is relevant to the current food market, cooking oil industries, and stock feed production as it will keep a steady and increased supply of soybeans so as to consequently lower the prices of stock feed to help the poultry and fishing industries, improve nutrition levels through soya products and also lower the cost of cooking oil, to affordable levels by the poorest of our community.
