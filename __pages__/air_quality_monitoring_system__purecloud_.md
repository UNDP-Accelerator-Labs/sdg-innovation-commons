This is a joint effort with the local company INform (https://inform.mk/) where our experts developed a portable device (BlueCloud) capable of measuring air pollutants thus monitoring the air quality. The design and the development of the device was made by INNOFEIT experts whereas INform’s experts developed a cloud back-end for data storage and analysis. As a result, the integrated solution is now commercialized as PureCloud. Moreover, INNOFEIT is in the process of developing a calibration laboratory for certifying the monitoring devices.
