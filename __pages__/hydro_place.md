> Description of the solution

The Hydro Place was designed by KPMB architects and features 78-foot indoor waterfalls that humidify and dehumidify incoming air. They cool the building in warmer seasons and reduce energy consumption by 77%. The waterfalls are designed with strands of mylar held at the bottom by bronze weights, and small valves at the top of each strand control the water flow. 100% fresh air into the offices is first drawn into the 6-storey south atrium. There it is preconditioned by a water feature (tensioned stainless steel cables with conditioned water running down each strand) before being drawn into the office‚Äôs raised floors. This feature humidifies the ambient fresh air in winter and dehumidifies air in summer.
