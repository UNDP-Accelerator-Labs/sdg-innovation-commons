Recognizing the need to provide support to the fight against COVID-19, UNDP Viet Nam scanned through different robotic solutions within the country and found two prominent robots that were ready for testing and scaling up: Ohmni and BeetleBot. The former is able to meet and greet patients, perform remote diagnosis, treatment and healthcare training; the latter can deliver food and supplies to patients without human control.
