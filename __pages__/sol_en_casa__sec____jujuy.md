> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning from this activity is to understand what factors favor and/or hinder the adoption of solar water heaters in low-income neighborhoods of Jujuy. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

This study was exploratory in nature. Therefore, it sought to understand which factors hinder or facilitate the adoption of solar water heaters in Jujuy. From there, in a second experimental phase, five hypotheses are planned to be tested: 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information about the technical aspects and maintenance of the solar water heater and the evaluation of the device. 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information about the economic benefits (savings) of the solar water heater and the evaluation of the device. 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information regarding the technical aspects and maintenance of the solar water heater and the intention to use the device. 

There is a positive relationship between receiving information about the economic benefits (savings) of the solar water heater and the intention to use the device. 

There is a positive (and stronger) relationship between receiving information based on neighbors' experiences concerning the technical aspects and maintenance of the solar water heater and the intention to use the device, compared to receiving the same information without involving the neighbors

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

In the exploratory phase 129 households were surveyed, where only 9 used the solar water heater exclusively, 45 used it alongside other devices, and 75 did not use it. In many households that had water heaters but chose not to use them, installation issues, technical difficulties, and a lack of training and support were reported. Simple and low-complexity technical problems that had gone undetected were identified, including the improper installation of the device on the roof. This situation also applies to more costly but similarly low-complexity problems, such as construction deficiencies in the homes. The lack of follow-up and proper training has been a significant obstacle to the effective adoption of this technology. The absence of a critical mass of users further compounded the lack of support. As a result, non-users had no access to peer-provided information about shared experiences or potential solutions, nor did they have neighbors who could guide them through the learning curve of using the devices. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology for the Jujuy solar water heater project provides valuable insights through a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews and focus groups with survey data. However, the small sample of exclusive users and the reliance on self-reported data limit the scope of the findings. To strengthen the impact of this study, we would recommend increasing the sample size, incorporating objective usage metrics, and conducting longitudinal assessments to track behavior changes over time. Additionally, establishing peer-to-peer learning networks could also address the gap in technical support, enhancing adoption and sustainability.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We propose conducting an experiment to identify the factors that promote the adoption and use of installed solar water heaters in households. These devices are high-cost, yet residents often lack the technical means and financial resources for proper maintenance. The experiment will assess strategies to promote the use of solar energy among indigenous migrant populations living in the metropolitan area of the city. 

This study revealed that only 9% of surveyed households used the solar water heater as their sole source of hot water, while 45% used it in combination with other devices, and the remaining households did not use it at all. 

Interestingly, those who used the solar water heater rated it positively. Meanwhile, those who did not use it cited reasons such as a lack of information about its operation, unawareness of simple user-managed solutions, a lack of interaction with neighbors who had positive experiences, installation difficulties, or minor adjustments that could have been resolved with proper technical support. In sum, the survey demonstrated that a well-functioning technology is often disregarded when it is not properly installed or when users lack sufficient information about its use. 

The findings highlighted that training, the positive influence of other users, and technical support are key factors in optimizing the use of solar water heaters and ensuring their full integration into the daily lives of beneficiary families. All identified problems had relatively simple and low-cost solutions, suggesting that an experiment could help determine the impact of these solutions on the adoption and usage of the devices. 

Building on these insights, the proposed experiment seeks to measure the impact of specific informational interventions on the perception and use of solar water heaters. 

A "shock of information" will be implemented in two formats: one providing objective technical information and the other leveraging social norms, using testimonials from neighbors who have successfully optimized their use of these devices. 

This experiment will assess changes in users' opinions about solar water heaters and in the willingness of non-users to adopt them before and after the intervention. It will identify effective strategies to enhance the adoption and optimization of solar energy use. The results will serve as inputs for future communication campaigns, strategies, and solutions aimed at expanding access to renewable energy solutions by promoting the adoption of solar water heaters and optimizing their use for current users. 

Given the high cost of the already installed equipment and the difficulty of accessing new technologies in the region, this experiment is essential to ensuring the energy sustainability of families (https://www.undp.org/es/argentina/publicaciones/spotlight-renewable-energy-solutions-mapping-argentina) who already have these devices on their rooftops. The combination of the restoration project with the experiment will not only improve the existing infrastructure but also generate replicable knowledge for other regions facing similar challenges. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The results of this experiment will be presented in collaboration with the Jujuy Institute of Housing and Urban Development (IVUJ) and the government of Jujuy, with the aim of informing authorities about the issues identified in the diagnosis. Additionally, these results can be shared with the Argentine Network of Municipalities Facing Climate Change (RAMCC), a coalition of municipalities and communes that coordinates and promotes strategic plans to address climate change in Argentina and other Latin American countries. Lastly, the findings can be shared with networks of local governments that UNDP is in contact with.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

 The main learnings include identifying technical and training barriers as the biggest obstacles to the adoption of renewable technologies, and the importance of continuous support to maximize the project's benefits. On the one hand, the technical barriers include the incorrect orientation of the device on rooftops, poor installation, and the incompatibility of housing infrastructure with the water heaters. On the other hand, the training barriers involve the lack of follow-up after installation, as there was no support to help users navigate the learning curve of integrating a new device with these characteristics into their daily lives. Moreover, a support network within the community could facilitate the exchange of experiences and solutions among neighbors, who have often demonstrated an ability to solve problems creatively and independently. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

 First, the results may be of interest to the country office. In particular, the environment &amp; sustainable development department can benefit from the findings of this experiment, as they promote the integration of environmental considerations into the development process, driving projects that contribute to sustainability and the fight against poverty. Additionally, they support the development of public policies at both general and territorial scales.  On the other hand, these results may also be relevant to the inclusive growth department, as it works with vulnerable populations, particularly those that could benefit from cost-saving initiatives.   

Second, these findings could be of interest to laboratories in other countries working on similar topics, as well as to RBLAC and other bureaus. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The results of this experiment could be beneficial for various sectors beyond UNDP. Firstly, both the Argentine government and public policy designers could directly benefit by obtaining key information to implement similar initiatives in other regions, promoting access to renewable energy in vulnerable communities. They could use the results as a valuable tool, providing a model for public policies that seek to integrate sustainable energy solutions into social housing programs. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

 In the initial phase of the research and development initiative, a first iteration was conducted through an exploratory study, which involved diagnosing the current situation of the households benefiting from the policy. Subsequently, efforts have been focused on securing funding for a new experiment, which could involve multiple iterations, although these have not yet been defined as they are still being designed. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

This initiative for installing solar water heaters was carried out in 2016 and 2017. In this regard, conducting a situational diagnosis and user typology analysis prior to the experiment was crucial, as there was no initial information on the state of the households, especially given that the solar energy solutions had been installed some time ago. This type of diagnosis is necessary even for more recent initiatives, where it is not always clear whether people have adopted the solution. Through this process, users can be classified into five categories to formulate relevant questions.   

Second, territorial diversity must be considered. In our case, although most of the households were public housing, there was socioeconomic diversity among users, which could lead to different lines of inquiry. Not all users necessarily had economic need as their primary motivation for using renewable energy.   

Finally, this initial diagnosis has limitations, as the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire population. Therefore, more in-depth studies should be conducted to enhance confidence in the findings. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment can be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs. The methodology used (diagnostics, surveys, in-depth interviews, and focus groups) can be applied to other sustainable technology projects in sectors such as access to clean water, clean energy, health and well-being, or sustainable infrastructure. It is necessary to consider the infrastructure and local context in this experiment, since it depended on the high solar radiation in Jujuy, meaning that implementing a similar project in areas with lower sunlight levels would necessitate technological adjustments to ensure efficiency.  

Additionally, it needs to be considered the cultural adaptations to other local characteristics. Each community has its own unique barriers to adoption, levels of awareness, and communication networks. Some may require more extensive training and engagement strategies, while others may naturally share knowledge and experiences more effectively. Therefore, understanding local behavioral patterns and social structures is crucial. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle were crucial in shaping this experiment, especially in collaboration with the EcoAndina Foundation, previously mapped by UNDP’s solution mapping area (as mentioned in the renewable energy report in Argentina). This early connection not only facilitated the identification of a strategic partner but also allowed the project to benefit from the foundation's experience and expertise in design and implementation. In hindsight, it would have been beneficial to delve deeper into the "exploration" phase with the Solution Mapper and Explorer to better anticipate the technical and adoption challenges faced by users of the solar water heaters.

> What surprised you?

The biggest surprise was the resistance to change among beneficiaries, highlighting the need for comprehensive training and continuous technical support to ensure the effective adoption of sustainable technologies in vulnerable contexts. All the problems had relatively simple solutions. Technical problems included the incorrect orientation of the device on rooftops, poor installation, and the incompatibility of housing infrastructure with the water heaters. Another issue was the lack of follow-up after installation, as there was no support to help users navigate the learning curve of integrating a new device with these characteristics into their daily lives. Moreover, a support network within the community could facilitate the exchange of experiences and solutions among neighbors, who have often demonstrated the ability to solve problems creatively and independently.
