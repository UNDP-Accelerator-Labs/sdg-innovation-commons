## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Limited awareness of the communities of the large scale impact of invasive alien species on Samoa's biodiversity. Contributes to only the Government and farmers working to eliminate IAS.

2. Untapped community potential to manage IAS.

3. Requires further learning to explore viable opportunities.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Not applicable at this stage.

> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Most appropriate data methods for the photojournaling testing. The gaps in available data in terms of IAS was how pervasive the growth was in real time and through pictorial evidence this was able to be documented including locations.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Sensemaking allowed us to map key local communities with awareness of IAS and through collective intelligence we were able to ascertain common local practices that the youth farmers used to manage IAS on their farms. 
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge.

> Please state the name of the partner:

Samoa National Youth Council Inc

> What sector does your partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

The Samoa National Youth Council is the recognized youth platform in Samoa both by the Government and other NGOs. In addition, the structure of their membership which are Village Youth Representatives is what was needed for the AccLab to navigate the village locations chosen for the first mapping test.

> Is this a new and unusual partner for UNDP?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The visual documentation of how pervasive certain IAS is a game changer in leveraging towards other key partners on new and potential mapping methods that would engage communities in not only mapping them but also collectively working towards managing IAS growth.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
