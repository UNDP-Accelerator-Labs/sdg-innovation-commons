## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Education digitalization and solutions for other key development challenges
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that most of Malawi’s secondary schools lack facilities such as physical science laboratories, especially Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSS) and Open Secondary Schools (OSS). This challenge creates unequal learning for learners in CDSSs in rural/ remote areas and OSSs compared to their counterparts in private and public schools in urban areas or that are strategically placed to attract top students. This affects teaching and learning and ultimately deteriorates quality of education, student performance and participation in tertiary education.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Malawi's population is growing at such a fast pace that the government and private sector are failing to provide enough schools with adequate facilities for learning, especially STEM subjects, such as science laboratories. However, all students following the government curriculum write the same examinations. Students from schools without science labs are therefore at a huge disadvantage and have very minimal chances to attend Public Universities. Again, technology advancements cannot be made with weak human development in STEM.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

A child born today in Malawi will only be 41% as productive as they could be if they had access to complete and quality education and good health, according to a human capital initiative by the World Bank. By the time they are 18, Malawian children should have finished approximately nine years of school. This equates to just five years when quality of learning is taken into account. This reveals a four-year learning gap.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Interupted learning due to pandemics like COVID and students outcry for access to digital platforms for continued learning and the need to bridge the inequality gap. The complaint of the ministry of education on poor students outcomes especialy in STEM subjects during national school examinations. Low representation of girls/women in STEM professional courses and jobs.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Ability to bring diverse stakeholders together (including existing linkages with Min of Education, universities, private sector). Collective Intelligence, sensemaking and innovation methods to understand the challenge and seek solutions.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

To address the challenge of limited science labs in Malawi's community day and open secondary schools, UNDP Malawi #AcceleratorLab is assessing how virtual science labs can ensure education for everyone everywhere.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We want to know if engaging learners in free, safe, comprehensive and unlimited scientific experimentation boosts their confidence in science and improves their performance in traditional science assessments and national examinations while preventing the loss of learning due to pandemics/disruptions in running school calendars or lack of traditional laboratory resources.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Gamification: Use of a mobile gaming platform to utilise effective human-computer interaction mechanismgs for experiments.  Participatory Design: To involve end users of the product (students and teachers) in informing the design of the technology  Prototyping: Develop multiple versions of the mobile app based on teacher and student feedback  Data visualization: Dashboard with graphical reports for teachers and students will visualise data generated from using the mobile app.  Pilots: test the usability and acceptability of the mobile app in selected population before use in schools.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Observation: students and teachers provided the opportunity to use the App for active teaching and learning in classroom setting. Direct interviews: students and teachers cpatured thoughts on introduction of the app for teaching and learning practical science courses/subjects. Stakeholder engagement: buy in from ministry of education and other stakeholders in the education sector will be assessed to gauge interest in the app and potential of uptake after testing. Written policies: assessment of the relevance of the app with government/national policies, suitability of the app introduction and its positioning in the education digitalisation agenda.
