During one of the field trips, we talked to the local emergency services and realized they do not have updated maps to rely on and many local residents have difficulties describing where they are on the phone. For instance, a third of all of the calls to the firefighting department mentions only informal references to the location. While there are some local firefighters in the team, most of them came from elsewhere and they do not know the area well. Same for the police and ambulance. 



We looked at what these emergency service teams drew on their maps with pencils, collected public part of the info, and combined it with the responses received by requesting guidance to random locations from the local residents. All of this knowledge we added on the existing map (also excluding the surnames of local famous and infamous people, whose houses are often used as a location reference) and passed it back to the emergency teams. Thereby we combined the knowledge of police, ambulance, firefighters, and the local residents. 



The exercise proved to be very much appreciated by the emergency teams, who said it would save them lots of time in the future.
