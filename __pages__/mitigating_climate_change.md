> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The mitigation of climate change will greatly contribute to the tragetory growth of our country's economy.

> Technical Feasibility

In order to eradicate this problem, we need to plant many trees. And the study of agricultural courses like Forestry can tremendously help here.Through afforestation, which is the planting of new trees where there were none, and reforestation,which is the planting of trees to replace the used ones, we can greatly help curb the negative effects of climate change, and thereby tragect our country's economy to greater heights.

> Anticipated Social Impact
