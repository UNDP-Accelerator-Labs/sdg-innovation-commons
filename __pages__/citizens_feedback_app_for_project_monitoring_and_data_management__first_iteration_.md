## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

> Innovative monitoring methodologies can help project teams stay on track with their work plans and in turn help to accelerate SDGs
> Creating new platforms for monitoring enables diverse feedback from a range of stakeholders that can benefit projects by creating a more holistic understanding of impact on beneficiaries
> Digitization of project monitoring via a mobile app can help streamline monitoring, provide quick real time feedback, and ease of data sharing between stakeholders
> While digitization of project monitoring can provide many advantages, it is important to also have provisions for project monitoring that may not have access to internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas (such as providing an offline mode)
> An innovative mobile app that can streamline monitoring of projects and allow for diverse range of feedback can help projects by supporting and encouraging accountability in addressing various frontier challenges

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Pending first field roll out (app is currently still being tested in-house with staff)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

while there were some technical challenges linking the mobile app with UNDP platform POCOMAS, the real barriers are yet to be encountered when tested out in the field in regards to ease of use and feasibility.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The app needed existing project data to link to current active UNDP projects for future monitoring.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The selected innovation methods were necessary in the design of the app that would help monitor impacts of UNDP projects in addressing frontier challenges. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A in first iteration but they may be engaged when app is tested in field.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Consultant that was engaged in the design of the app is a professional from the Fiji National University. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Data/ coder from the FNU was a new partner for UNDP - this engagement is new/ special as the UNDP Pacific Office has never built a project monitoring app until now.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Pacific Digital Governance Expert: technical advice
Internal Review and Monitoring Unit: advice on project monitoring standards
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The innovative app helps to include diverse opinions on the progress and impact of UNDP projects and allow for a wider range of insights. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
