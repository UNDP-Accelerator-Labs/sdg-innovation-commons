Social distancing is difficult in practice in our daily lives, especially when various tasks that require close contact. To prevent COVID-19 from spreading, social distancing has become a necessary principle to follow. Hubot is a solution to the problem. It reduces physical interaction while not compromising the effectiveness in information transfer. 

Hubot is a movable robot that can interact with humans through three languages: English, Chinese, Malay. It can also recognise human faces. The person can interact with Hubot through a touchscreen interface on it. Hubot is suitable to be placed at service counters to communicate with humans and answer general questions.
