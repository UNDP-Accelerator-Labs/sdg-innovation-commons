> Title of the innovation

GGS (Geo Gardening System)

> Brief description of the innovation

Geo Garden System (GGS) is the improved technique of growing plants without soil and limitations of space and climate. As the world wide population continues to grow, the challenge is to produce more amount of food due to this to maintain the sustainability the new modern technologies were introduced. In 2015, United state assumed that the world population will grow to 9.6 billion by 2050 and 70% of people will live in the urban areas. More than 70% food is needed but 80% land is already in use for cultivation practices. In 1900 the world population is around 3 billion, during that time per capita land is 0.16 ha. By 2050 it was reduced in to 0.6 ha. To overcome these problems the Geo garden system has been introduced. The soil less culture also known as hydroponics, it is the cultivation of plants in a liquid usually water with or without the use of artificial media (nutrient media). It will give growth to the plants under controlled atmosphere. In the last few years due to the avoidance of methyl bromide in the soil culture the hydroponic system has emerged.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

One of the major benefits of this innovation is its contribution to economic growth. The innovation will lead to higher productivity of different crops. As productivity rises, more vegetables and fruits are produced in other words, the economy grows. This Innovation bring vast benefits for consumers and businesses. Once the innovation is implemented it will increase crop production and lower poverty levels and number of workers will increase. We intend to invest the prize money in the innovation as a means to grow/improve it. It will go towards the purchasing of all needed material for the complete prototype and make the potential off takers aware of it. Our targeted off takers are the small and large scale farmers and and also urban areas settlers who lacks space for gardening.

> Technical Feasibility

Although there are quite a few home garden systems on the market, GGS stands out in that it is designed to be flexible. The garden comes in different sizes to better suit your needs. The system is arranged in a tower shape, made up of one, two or four stacked trays that use a soil-free organic system for cultivation. Each tray is suitable to a certain type of growth using a natural substrate (such as coconut fiber). For lighting, the system has an integrated lighting system that mimics sunlight and promotes faster growth.  No matter the size, the entire system is designed to be user-friendly and produce zero waste. Better yet, the garden system is nearly 100 percent self-sufficient for weeks at a time. Almost entirely maintenance-free, the gardening tower only needs to be watered every 1 to 3 weeks. To make it even easier, there is even a handy there are sensors to take care of the plants while you are away from home. The sensors monitors the amount of water, energy and nutrients and adjusts automatically according to the needs of the plants. This precise system allows anyone to grow plants without generating unnecessary waste.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There are numerous impacts of cultivating plants under soil less culture as compared to soil based agriculture. With very little effort we can produce a clean and healthy vegetables and fruits. The concept of Geo garden system supports the sustainability of food- water security, usage of land, and health. 
Soilless culture can be the effective tool to increase the crop yield and, if closed irrigation systems are adopted could increase the water-use efficiency, also reduce the environmental impact of greenhouses and nurseries. There is no soil borne diseases, soil pest attack to the soilless cultivated plants. It also helps in temperature control, reduce evaporative water loss and protection against changing weather. In the future, GGS could be emerging techniques for the supplying of food to the world wide population. By implementing the Geo garden system, it will yield a better quality of agricultural products, which is expected to meet the consumer preferences and also contribute to the think 2044 agenda. GGS can also be profitable on a commercial scale if the grower devotes the time and attention required for any successful business.
