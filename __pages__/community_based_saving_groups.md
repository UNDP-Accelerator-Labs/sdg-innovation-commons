In Ecuador, in both the rural and urban context, women  create and participate in community-based savings and credit groups to solve a problem of financial exclusion. Five savings groups were visited and discussion held in focus group. Rural women who live in poverty conditions cannot access credit loans to finance their livelihoods, as they must jump over economic and bureaucratic hurdles: having a guarantor, real estate, employment contracts and regulatory paperwork that only formal workers can provide. Hence, they have taken the matters in their own hands and self-organized these piggy bank initiatives. Communities, led by women, organize savings and credit accounts, in which the main asset is not the money itself, but solidarity, trust and commitment.
