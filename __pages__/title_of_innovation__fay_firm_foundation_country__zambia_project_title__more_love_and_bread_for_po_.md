> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Commercial viability of the innovation
We will contribute to poverty reduction when we create employment through startup of new enterprises/ expansion of existing ones. Will generate income for ourselves and others, through job creation.  Poverty is also reduced, new/ simple agriculture methods, backyard gardening using sacks. Crops produced, as potatoes, onions amaranthine, collected collectively, sold to already existing businesses at wholesale prices. 50% profits shared among the participants thereby enabling them to generate income.
Can assist in improving operations of already existing businesses by accessing increased quantities of crops at wholesale prices, resale at retail prices get marginal profit, have opportunity to order, pay in advance for expected crops to be harvested thereby improving their operations, requests us  cultivate certain crops on their behalf, at prescribed quantity and specified date.
Target market is women marketers’ 
Challenge prize will help business to grow and continue, future plans already exist to purchase farm lands, agriculture inputs, equipment and buses to transport workers engaged in family oriented agriculture activities to work. 
Value addition on environment, backyard gardens enable families to maintain clean backyards, advantage of using sacks is, they decompose faster, affordable, beneficial, protects people and preserves the  quality the environment.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Anticipated Social Impact
Probability of success - failure 80% -20%. Can improve lives of other,1)they acquire agriculture knowledge of simple methods of agriculture, 2) job creation enable them earn an income, feed their families, 3) access to nutritious foods thus improving their socio-economic conditions and expanding the primary health care. Low productivity, lack of agriculture knowledge by urban women identified constraints to poverty reduction.
Intervention relevance to current market amidst the covid-19 pandemic; most families are affected/ infected by the pandemic. Some families lost loved ones, guardians’, parents, bread winners, others lost jobs, no income, current market lagging behind, has gaps that need be filled. Intervention fills the gap, balances market. Economic growth starts from individual participation, families in communities, main players before it grows into bigger picture.
Innovation is applicable as the target population exits within reach and located within the parameter.
Size of potential market is enough to sustain business; both domestic and regional markets absorb increased food production. Demand for food in Lusaka exceeds supply evidenced by the large amount of food imported. High levels of poverty, proves demand for food. Potatoes, other crops find their way on the Zambia market, but also exported in neighboring countries.
