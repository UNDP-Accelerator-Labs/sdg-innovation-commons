## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

“Our challenge is to learn how public space is perceived by the citizens in Bissau and create conditions for participatory urban design (both form and function) and planning where residents of an area can share their views, experiences, wishes, and skills with the municipality and other stakeholders who are responsible for building public spaces.“  During the exploration phase, the Lab and the students from KTH and Lusófona, interviewed citizens in different parts of Bissau to learn more about their thoughts and feelings when it comes to public space as well as how they can be improved. Some of the main challenges presented were:    1.       Lack of public space and amenities 2.       Maintenance of public space (lack of funds) 3.       Citizen action and ownership 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1. “IF… if awareness is created through storytelling and nudging, THEN … citizens will care more for public spaces”. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test the hypothesis we hired two people who observed the park and the behaviour of its users during two weeks. We compared week 1 (without storytelling posters) with week 2 (with storytelling posters).

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

We were counting how many people who were using the park in a disfavorable way. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data collection was made through observation. We had two people observing the site everyday during the test.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

8 days

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

The time for this experiment was 2 weeks, one of the AccLab officers would pass by the site at least once everyday to check upon the data collection team (2 people), in regards to external resources the Town Hall of Bissau supported with allocation of a team the first week to clean up the site and give support. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

To review the experiment we only used " observation" to collect data, next time we would like to include interviews to get more insight into the effect of the experiment. For this experiment we only worked with external partners, next time we will make sure to anchor it more deeply into the CO, working closely with a programme officer who already has a strong relationship with national partners.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

5 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

61000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, we are planing to share the results with our partners and see how the activity can be scaled. We also plan to continue this learning cycle, intervening from the angle of " lack of maintainence". Here we will test if a Godfather system can make possible sustainable maintainence of public spaces in Bissau.  

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We are discussing to scale it with the Town Hall of Bissau: using storytelling for behaviour change in park users multiple other parks/ public spaces, implimenting one of the students proposals of how to re-think public space and conduct another experiment testing a Godfather-system for maintainence of public space.

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Some of the main challenges in relation to public space in Bissau are:    1.       Lack of public space and amenities 2.       Maintenance of public space (lack of funds) 3.       Citizen action and ownership      We also learned that:  - Local context and relationship is essential for viability of initiatives.  - Co-fund and co-impliment projects with a project officer with a committed national partner can facilitate our activities.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The experiment was conducted in the rainy season which created several delays and difficulties for us. Additionally we experienced political instability during the experiment where the main team of the Bissau Town Hall was exchanged, it is now a challenge to build up a new relationship of trust and see how we can continue to work together. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All clusters because it shows how storytelling and nudging has the potential to create behavioral change.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministries and the Town Hall because it shows how they can continue to use storytelling and nudging to create behavioral change.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We modified the placement of bences, hand washing stations and waste bins to making them more accessible to the users. We also saw that we had too many waste bins of a too big of a size.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Make sure you create close relationships with the Municipality and that you pick the right time of the year for the test as it´s an open air activity, this will facilitate the experimentation. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes it can, for example storytelling could be used to nudge BI in public services in the Ministry of Justice (SDG16)

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The team was trying to optimize time working on multiple learning cycles during the same time. Next time I would like to work closer with the Solution Mapper and Explorer for a deeper and more dynamic process.

> What surprised you?

How strong of an influence storytelling can have on people.
