Protecting water resources from contamination
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to protect water resources from contamination that ultimately impact human development

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Guatemala, the implementation of participatory actions in the integrated management of solid waste at the municipal level is listed as one of the strategic goals of the National Development Plan and the Country Priorities. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) and UNDP Guatemala are focusing on the establishment of baselines and indicators in areas of biological importance in fluvial and marine-coastal zones, such as the Motagua river (the largest in the country). The river carries high volume of waste to the Atlantic Ocean, that has created a geopolitical crisis with the neighboring country Honduras. UNDP Guatemala has been experimenting with digital technologies, to inform the design, implementation, and monitoring of solid waste management interventions. The UNDP Accelerator Lab has particularly explored Computer Vision and Land Surface Temperature (LST), using geolocated data sources like high resolution satellite imagery, and the integration of geolocated data layers to guide evidence-based decision making regarding environmental policy design and monitoring. Further efforts are needed to identify and test participatory methods and low-cost/effective solutions scalable to central and local governments.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



La lab’s added value is to bring innovative methods and technologies, and uniquely positioned within and outside UNDP to contribute to the implementation of the integrated management of water resources in coordination with central and local authorities. This effort are aligned with the strategic goals of the National Development Plan and Country Priorities, foster key learnings and results from previous tackled challenges, and takes advantage of a positive momentum on national inclusive digital transformation efforts with new authorities.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



The Accelerator Lab in Guatemala is tackling the protection of water resources by incorporating state-of-the art technologies and participatory methods in coordination with central and local governments and other relevant actors in society.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Investigate current methods used by relevant national actors to anticipate water availability, such as climate models and tools used to predict rainfall patterns

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The sources of data address the non existing information of available solutions used by key authorities, which can be helpful to identify missing opportunities based on state-of-the-art innovations
## Learning questions

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Ideate and co-create with relevant stakeholders on the potential solutions

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Central and local authorities face challenges for generating up-to-date and high quality statistics regarding the location of illegal dumpsites and associated aspects close to water resources
## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How to monitor threats to the water resources?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Computer vision for providing a cost-efficient method for estimating the location of potential illegal dumpsites based on imagery characteristics

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The grow phase would include scaling the tested solutions (technologies, data sources and methods) to central and local governments, overcoming adoption barriers intrinsic to national institutions - particularly very low capacity and resources.
