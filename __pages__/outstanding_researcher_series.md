> Title of the innovation

Outstanding Researcher Series

> Brief description of the innovation

The outstanding researcher series is a set of innovative workshops (often delivered online and with the aid of several technologies) aimed at developing outstanding multi-disciplinary researchers and getting them to think about transforming research output into workable solutions for society's good.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The problem we are trying to address and for whom (the market): Good Research &amp; Development can help organizations come up with innovations that solve customer pains. However, data shows that less than 11% of Zambians are engaged in R&amp;D despite its importance to national development.  The outstanding researcher series is here to change the narrative by using innovative ways to capture potential researchers and develop them into outstanding researchers.

The  new way we address the problem: We move away from the normal classroom arrangement and employ technology to keep the audience engaged. Along the way, we give them practical feedback about their research aspirations and projects in order to keep them engaged on their research goals.

How our innovation advances new solutions to the selected sector: Our approach carters for several sectors and is expected to lead to new discoveries and development of new products in various sectors (360 degrees addition to the body of knowledge)

The challenge prize will help the business grow mainly via its contribution to product development (it will be used to fund research and development of processes and systems that will help us deliver better quality research training eco-systems for our target market; i.e. it will be used for website, application development, online meeting platforms, development of higher quality curriculum, improvement of pedagogy etc.)

> Technical Feasibility

The learning materials are scientifically developed by researchers more experienced than the target audience. Technology is employed to deliver the lessons whether or not COVID-19 safety measures (such as lockdowns) are in place. Technology is utilized to ensure wide access by our target market

A prototype (video presentation) is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Op0vgjkkoudeij_UpttdM5ZaHRnJVNxs/view?usp=sharing
(Best viewed on computer running google chrome; access request may be needed in some cases - if so, contact the email address in this form)

Our business continuity beyond the challenge: While the prize will improve the quality of our service/product, our own sustainability plan involves us charging a premium to organizations for attendees they send to the Outstanding Researcher series in a quest to improve their research capacity. It also involves charging a premium to organizations for us to conduct research for them on a consultancy basis. 

Key Performance Indicators aspects include

Specific goals: To get at least 30 paying customers every month
Measurement: Number of paying customer enrolled on the program
Attainability: Target clients who need to improve research skills (Schools and industry)
Realistic aspect: 30 only per month out of thousands of potential customers
Time: The project is in perpetuity from FourthIR's perspective but the monthly target give a time limit of some sort

The prize money will therefore be used to improve the current quality of the prototype and the processes around how the prototype is delivered. This will ultimately help us to scale up.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Being mostly online, the program is accessible countrywide. But current program beneficiaries are mostly from Lusaka and copperbelt. FourthIR Limited believes that research is critical to solving societal challenges. The more quality researchers we develop, the more knowledge addition and product development is likely to occur.

What is the probability of success? We are already offering the Outstanding Researcher series and are getting attendees without extensive advertising.  

How relevant is the intervention to current market? Most of our current attendees are students either doing or about to start doing their final year research. This program helps them sharpen their skills in practical ways the universities are not filling. A few clients in industry have been expressing interest to join in sharpening their skills

How applicable is the proposed innovation in targeted context?  The Outstanding researcher series is helping current generation of upcoming researchers gain confidence in their research skills. This information can then be passed on to next generations - having a ripple effect.

Is size of potential market enough to sustain business? As of 2017, there were about 4.1 million school going children in Zambia (https://knoema.com/ZMES2018/educational-statistics-of-zambia?location=1000050-lusaka&amp;indicator=1000040-number-of-students). Each of them presents a potential future researcher/customer in addition to the over 40,000 current students in tertiary institutions

What is impact of proposed innovation on environment? Some of the researchers we work with are environmental specialists. This ensures a multi disciplinary approach to environmental issues.

What is the value addition of innovation to the environment? We are helping develop researchers who are able to solve several societal challenges including environmental issues. Our research commitment to this is also testament (See link above shared again here (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6831481339682791424)
