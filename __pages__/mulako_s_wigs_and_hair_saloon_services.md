- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation is entirely based on value addition. I buy hair and turn it into wigs that can easily be worn by women and sell them at a higher price other than the actual price of the hair itself. It improves operation for existing business systems in a way that they provide the unprocessed hair which we buy from existing business operations on the market  and as retailers, we  add value to it. My target market is women, business women, and civil servants alike.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is backwardly designed. Before I create a new product and sell it to the public, I first carry out a needs analysis to ascertain , identify and pinpoint the needs of the end users as well as what is in fashion at the moment. I also design in such a manner that is unique and not common knowing that there is competition on the market. For it to be implemented, there is need for all the necessary materials and accessories to be in place to avoid time wasting. That is why I need Capital start up amount.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can improve lives of others as it will provide both business opportunities and skill sets for your women in my city/ community. These skills are necessary as women will independently own businesses of their own and employment opportunities will keep on being created for the future generations.
