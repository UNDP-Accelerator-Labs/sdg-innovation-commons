> Brief description of the innovation

Goliath Aerospace Technology is a commercial drone and data collection service provider that collect, analyse and distribute aerial data to clients in a cost effective way which in turn reduces operational cost and resources. Offering an integrated drone platform, flight and analytical software and services for business. providing solutions for sustainable forest, agriculture and environment management  (Monitoring, Verification and Reporting) by combining digital tools, big-data, AI and experience from the sector. It supports the entire value chain of any natural resource management asset. It allows important ecosystem services, such as protection against natural hazards (e.g.: fire, insects, pests etc.), beehive management etc. it can produce cost savings of up to 30% just from converting paper-based practices and manual data collection into digital form used with smartphone. We estimate that it can also improve the efficiency of daily routines by 15-20%, increase revenues of project stakeholders by 10-15% and reduce CO2 emissions. Additionally, we calculate the positive environmental impact (e.g.: carbon sequestrated) or, related parameters from assets enabling income generation by selling those carbon credits.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our focus market is forestry, agriculture and ecosystem conservation and regeneration. We are unique in Zambia. Our service will be Zambia’s’ first independent inclusive natural resource information and advisory service designed for small scale farmers and out grower organizations. We will work directly with small farmers through our own network of field agents across 750,000 sq.km of Zambia. We also work extensively with organisations supporting small farmers including Muchinga Corridors, Good Nature Agro, BioCarbon Partners and COMACO to provide their natural resource information services. 
The product will cover their needs that will satisfy our customers such as accounting, areal maps, management, analytical tools, record keeping, agriculture stress indicator index, sowing dates, length of crop cycle and crop-specific water-stress sensitivity coefficients. Clients will access these via the platform. Consultation and capacity building will be done in-person field site or online/webinar. 
Our work also supports efforts to provide digital educational services to farmers and to outgrower organisations working with farmers. Information services require specialist expertise and in-country facilities in analysis and advisory development. Natural resource information services (accounting, modelling, algorithms and advisory heuristics) require a digital functionality and user facing features that are the expertise of Wuudis.

> Technical Feasibility

Our technical work involves development of machine learning algorithms, decision-support digital tools and educational services for agricultural and Forestry sectors. These methods are an integral part of natural resource advisory, carbon accounting, farmer performance assessment for financing, and training required to enhance productivity and mitigate the impacts of Climate Change.

Activity 2 - Expanded by implementing agroforestry and livestock support activities in communities/villages to reduce pressure on forest areas (targeting 20,000 ha) and by converting discarded wood into charcoal as an alternative sustainable livelihood option.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project can create jobs in three ways, firstly through the development of service agent networks to collect forest threat data and control it accordingly. This is a means of providing self-employment opportunities to local ‘micro-entrepreneurs’ to maintain sustainability and livelihood based on local forest resources. It also enables us to reach very distant and fragmented community level village forestry and farmers, as part of inclusivity obligation. Secondly, by supporting the growth of forest-based companies and farming outgrower companies, and by providing them access to state-of-the-art digitalized services that enable them to participate in carbon markets. Thirdly, by supporting sustainable intensification of natural resources, yield increases and associated indirect spillover job creation across the entire forestry sector. Over 35% of small farmers in Zambia are women. They typically dependent on nearby forest based non-wood resources and require the greatest assistance in the form of financial incentives and training to raise their productivity. With our partners in Zambia, we target a realistic doubling of income from $300 per annum to $600 in a 2-year period through our interventions to enhance productivity and monetize carbon.
