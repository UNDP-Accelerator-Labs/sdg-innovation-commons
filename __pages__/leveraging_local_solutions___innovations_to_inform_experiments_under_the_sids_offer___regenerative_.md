## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Although the tourism industry in Samoa struggled due to closure of borders, it was still able to operate due to the consistent patronage of the locals.  2. Since the opening of borders, majority of tourists is the Samoan diaspora from New Zealand and Australia. 3. Stockholm +50 engagement - private sector in the hospitalilty and tourism industry shared the challenges of engaging with the communities as the RSE scheme is in direct competition with the labour market in Samoa. 4. Lack of funding to build institutions and operations of the sector therefore leading to limited resilience. 5. Not enough emphasis and focus on developing the national market. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Blog in progress.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. 2022 lockdown in February and March - delayed the horizon scanning. 2. Fragmented system - actors in the industry prioritize their focus on maintaining individual livelihoods therefore not affording capacity and time to work as a cohesive sector. 3. Low confidence of AccLab managers on the team's decision to focus on regenerative tourism as the next challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Covid-19 lockdowns and cost effective. Gap it was addressing the lack of community perspective on community tourism and employment and labour trends towards the hospitality industry.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Regenerative tourism is a pillar under the UNDP SIDS offer, the MCO had not expended comprehensive resources into understanding the challenge and potential opportunities that could be leveraged to build economic resilience in the communities. The horizon scanning that was conducted through the CATI services of Digicel was crucial for the Lab to get a sense of community perspective separate from what has been apparent from the private sector itself.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Samoa Hotel Association - discussions on the industries most pressing needs in the context of Covid-19 lockdown, borders opening and the RSE schemes in particular the impact of the heavy labour and brain drain it has caused.

Not applicable.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Digicel Samoa Ltd - utilized their CATI services to reach out to a sample size of the population on both islands of Samoa (Upolu and Savaii) to conduct an initial scan of getting their perspectives on various issues such as unemployment, borders opening and the direction they think the tourism industry should be developed towards.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Samoa Tourism Authority - discussions on where national agenda lay with the development of the tourism industry. In particular with what their priorities are in providing actual support and assistance towards actors in the tourism industry.
