Description: The municipality of Guatemala, together with Global Water Partnership have developed these pilot systems as a solution for water scarcity in urban areas of Guatemala.

Like other collection systems, these are based on the collection of rain by gutters installed on the roof, which lead the water to tanks that serve to contain the water.   

Interesting feature: It is an adaptation of water harvesting systems for communities, taken to a larger scale. This proves that it could be carried to even larger scales.
