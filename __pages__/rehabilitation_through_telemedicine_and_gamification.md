Raccoon.Recovery

				
				

Raccoon.Recovery is a CE certified GDPR compliant tool 
for physical rehabilitation after injuries and neurological diseases 
that provides better outcomes for patients and saves a therapist’s time:



gamification for patient motivation and retention during the full course;
more effective treatment thanks to tracking of patient’s progress;
automation and digitization of examination tests and reports;
possibility to use for remote rehab (telerehabilitation) with remote monitoring.



The solution, that includes an online platform and 
hardware, is already certified according to CE mark medical device Class
 1. Due to the lockdown and inability to ship sensors and controller to 
our customers, we decided to take care of you and propose our COVID-19 
response – Raccoon.Recovery Light. Now access to a platform that retains
 all its functions has become possible with a smartphone that is used 
instead of sensors. More information here: https://raccoon.world/light-facility/
