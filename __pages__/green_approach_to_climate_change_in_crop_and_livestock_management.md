> Title of the innovation

Green approach to climate change in crop and livestock management

> Brief description of the innovation

The farming area in which the Cooperative is operating is mostly affected by dry spells resulting into poor animal grazing and loss of crop due to dependence on seasonal rainfalls.  The soil nutrients are also lost due to erosions caused by dry climate. The inputs for successful innovation includes: installation of irrigation system, rearing of chicken layers, goat keeping and cultivation of moringa oleifera, pigeon peas and soya beans as cover crops for human and livestock consumption. 
Justification
The IDC Technical Note on the plant, gives the following principal reasons. 
•	They grow under poor soil and weather conditions.
•	They are a nutritious, high-protein pulse crop edible by human and animals.  
•	The fast-growing plants make good shade for other crops longer harvest span., 
•	Water and nutrients from deep in the soil can be caught by its deep taproot.
Research reviews that crops grown the year after soybeans often yield better because its long taproots open up the soil, break it down, and improve soil for the next crop. Soybeans can be used to clean up weed infestations in fields and has few insect concerns compared to other crops.
The innovation is a pilot project aimed exploring sustainable  biodiversity farming techniques.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income through the sale of fresh eggs, meat, animal feed pellets, and edible oils. The business will   establish a sustainable supplier food value chain aimed at improving the health of the soils and food system.  The income raised will form the revolving funds to support training and removing financial burials for farmers who intend to build the health of their soils, plant cover crops, use of more sustainable grazing practices and make better use of their water sources.
Our target market is the community, hospitality industry, the general public and the potential offtakers are Afriseed company and Kamano seed company
The innovation value addition on the environment is that:
•	Moringa shrubs are efficient absorbers of carbon emission. It improves the environmental eco-system;
•	The deep taproots of soybeans and pigeon peas are excellent nitrogen fixers and water nutrient carriers essential for agricultural practices; and
•	 chicken and goat droppings manures the soil for healthy farming production.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation seeks to suggest organic ways of conserving nature while raising livestock, on dry climate, growing soybeans as cover plant for grains, pigeon peas and moringa oleifera for consumption.  Shrubs fixes nitrogen and moisturize soils for food production.  Livestock droppings are composite fertilizers for growing vegetables and crops throughout the year using ground water generated from underground borehole.
Implementation Plan
1. Farmer identification - this will involve identifying location or area in which the project will take place.  key stakeholders are village indunas and small scale farmers
2. selection of successful small scale farmers
3. conduct training in farming management
4. Irrigation system Installation - this involve installation of windmill and irrigation pipes for gardening and watering of moringa trees 	
5.  poultry house Construction - this will accommodate 3,000 layers
Contact seed supplier	        
6. procure farming utilities, seed and organic fertilizers 	  
7. Transportation of building materials and farm inputs and produce		
 8. farmers inputs  Distribution 	
9. goats shelter Construction 	    
10. livestock user utilities procurement 	    
11. chicken layers Procurements	   
12. goats supply tender Invitation	         
13 storage bags Procurement 	    
14. Procure stitching machines and  weighing scale	
15. Harvest and packaging of soybeans for onward selling	     
16. post-harvest exercise report writing 	
17. Monitor and control	- this will involve Agronomist field  visitation
18. Closure  - this will involve reviewing project performance, audits, report writing, celebrating success and archiving documents for future referencing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1. start ups of locals in agribusiness will emerge; 2. nutrition at household level will be improved more on white meat, egg proteins; 3. Employment creation for locals.  the innovation is very relevant to the current market because people are more concern with the quality of life than ever before.  The demand for organically breed animals' meat and vegetables is on high demand.
