HerStory Foundation is a not-for-profit that creates innovative content for development, with a focus on gender equality, youth empowerment and women’s rights. They use storytelling, illustration, design, and dialogue to instill empowering and inspiring messages in children, youth and adults. Their vision as an agent of change is to ensure that they create impactful and quality development content to find creative, non-conventional ways of disseminating knowledge, steering more towards illustrated children's books and experiential learning as opposed to traditional advocacy tactics. Holding fast to the belief that storytellers and artists are catalysts of change, HerStory Foundation's work challenges social norms and prejudices, and proposes narratives about unity, inclusion and diversity.  In November 2017 HerStory launched HerStories: The Adventures of Supergirls at the annual Dhaka Lit Fest and in 2018 it launched the second volume. The illustrated children’s books included 21 stories of exceptional women of Bengal and present-day Bangladesh (from the astrologer and poet Khana to weightlifter Mabia Akhter). The book was created by a team of over 30 researchers, illustrators, designers, writers, translators and editors. It is available in English and in Bangla and has gone through 3 print runs.  In addition to content development, HerStory also works with teachers to launch original content in classrooms, through specially designed teaching materials and Read-Alouds. In September 2019, they launched the HerStory Reading Fellowship in partnership with the Women and Gender Studies Department of Dhaka University and Independent University Bangladesh. The one-year program has trained Fellows to read HerStories to students of class VI and guide them through discussions of key topics (gender equality, life plans, social responsibility, civil rights etc.). The Fellows undertake monthly school visits for Incredible Read-Alouds to practice their skills.  Taramon is HerStory Foundation’s latest venture and aims to serve the information needs of urban women. The content is targeted towards women aged 18 - 45 and is focused on well-being, relationships, lifestyle and social issues concerning women that are relevant to the context of Bangladesh. Taramon aims to inspire, inform, and engage women of different ages and backgrounds by providing interesting and informative written and visual content that can help women navigate their various social and personal challenges. It is a space for women to express themselves, showcase their successes, and build a supportive network. Content on the blog intends to generate discussion and challenge sexist social narratives by presenting a female perspective.
