> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Being a good recipient of solar irradiation, Bangladesh expects to largely harness solar energy source in order to achieve this target. However, installation one MW of solar power plant requires approximately 3.5~4 acres of land. Therefore, land constraint seems to be a challenge for a densely populated country like Bangladesh. Availability of plenty open rooftops may address the space constraint issue for installing solar panels. The Government of Bangladesh has enacted Net Metering Guideline on August 2018 to encourage the use of vacant spaces and rooftops in solar power generation. Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) is the pioneer in mass scale off-grid renewable energy dissemination in Bangladesh. Rooftop Solar Project is its latest intervention in renewable energy sector financing. Under this financing scheme IDCOL provides concessionary loan facility, technical compliance monitoring, project development support & performance monitoring support.

Up to July 2019, IDCOL has approved 11Rooftop Solar Projects of which 4 are already in operation with a cumulative capacity of about 3.07 MWp. IDCOL has a target to finance a total capacity of 300 MWp by 2022. The remaining projects are expected to come into operation shortly.
