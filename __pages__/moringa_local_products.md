Innovator: Nelsie James, former student of Aore Adventist Academy

Narrative: The majority of the Vanuatu population do not trust pharmacies and health centres but rely on natural remedies when they have health issues. Nelsie James, a former Aore Adventist student, has ventured into a small business with Moringa products such as soap bars, oils, even Moringa Jam. These local products help with white spots, ringworms, dandruff, helps rejuvenate dead skin cells caused by excessive kava drinking, heal and build the muscles, and freshen up the body after a shower. The price is affordable and provides individuals with huge health benefits.
