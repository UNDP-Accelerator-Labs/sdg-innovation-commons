> Brief description of the innovation

I or we believe that by creating a base or piece of work or job for the people will give them a base to think bigger, I started targeting projects that can bring about employment to others when I was 15 without any source of many it experience in any way as a 15yr boy but now am 22 I have gathered up experience in constructive ideas or businesses such as minerals,timber, construction,movie industry for health and other teachings etc right now we are processing timbers in farm blocks bigger contracts if operation are we financed can open up job so many people therefore if we as Zambia can have the mind of creating jobs for others we can move to the next level as a country there so many things we would like to change but it starts with understanding and we can only understand if we are free from poverty focusing on daily bread, let's creat jobs for every Zambia and help people with better intensions like us.
