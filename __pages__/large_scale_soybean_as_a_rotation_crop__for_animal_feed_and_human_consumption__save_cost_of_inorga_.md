> Title of the innovation

LARGE SCALE SOYBEAN AS A ROTATION CROP, FOR ANIMAL FEED AND HUMAN CONSUMPTION, SAVE COST OF INORGANIC FERTILIZERS AND ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY.

> Brief description of the innovation

Large scale farming of soybean, a nutritious and versatile legume for animal feed and human consumption aims at producing soybean to make animal feed (particularly poultry and pigs) and human consumption (protein alternatives, soybean meal/tofu, biscuits/cookies and vegetable oil for frying and baking). 
The innovation also aims at saving cost of inorganic fertilizers as soybean is legume, fixes nitrogen in the soil.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated by selling soybean to industries that manufacture animal feeds and foods for human consumption. This will help meet the increasing demand for for animal feed and human food as there will be constant supply.
The prize will help the business grow  as we will recruit a robust workforce, increasing production. The prize will also help us buy soybean fungicide to prevent pesticides.
Soybean is a legume and plays a role in biological nitrogen fixation, increasing soil fertility, saving costs of inorganic fertilizers. and enhancing biodiversity, hence the importance of large scale farming of soybean as a rotation crop.
The innovation supports conservation agriculture and a green environment.

> Technical Feasibility

There is no prototype as per se, however, we have been farming soybean on a small scale for a 3 years. 

GOAL Produce enough soybean to meet the increasing demand for animal feeds and food for human consumption
ALLOCATED RESOURCES: Adequate resources (time, money, workforce).
MILESTONES: Planting, Weeding, Harvesting Transporting to industries.
SUCCESS: Success will be measured by the number of bags or Kilograms or tons produced and amount of money realized.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Large scale soybean farming improve the health of many people as soybean is nutritious, supplying the body with proteins. Large scale soybean farming will also provide employment to people.
With the increasing demand for animal feeds and food for human consumption, large scale soybean farming is a way to go.
