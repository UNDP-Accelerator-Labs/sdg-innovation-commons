> On date (Day/Month/Year)

21.05.2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Climate Change

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Solid Waste Management

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What is the composition and volume of solid waste generated in public institutions

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Public Sector: Municipality of Panama City CSOs: The National Movement of Recyclers for Panama
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The activity consisted in prototyping an information system (digital tool) to aid recyclers in characterizing solid waste, primarily food waste, in public institutions

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF an information system based on latest legislative categorization of waste is utilized in public institutions, THEN institutions will be able to establish a baseline for solid waste management strategies.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

An information system developed for the legislative categorization of waste is utilized in a public institution (public food market) by recyclers. Recyclers will use the digital tool (an online survey tool) to categorize a measure the volume of waste in real time. Descriptive statistics will be used to establish a baseline and present the information to policymakers.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Volume and composition of solid waste in kg. The system will be tested in one iteration.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The information system itself is the tool used to collect the data

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 days

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 1

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
