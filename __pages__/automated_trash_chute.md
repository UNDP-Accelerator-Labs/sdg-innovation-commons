> Title of the innovation

Automated Trash chute

> Brief description of the innovation

An automated Trash chute, is an invasion tailored to collect trash and direct it to a central collection point for processing.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The invasion targets to eliminate pollution in general as well as sanitation issues. This invasion promotes other projects such as the implementation of plastic pavers, which are pavers made out of the mixture of plastics and sand, these pavers serve to be more durable than the normal pavers and save a more profitable way of eliminating plastics. 
This invasion is environmentally friendly, in the sense that even children can use it. And it can be accessed right from the comfort of the home, this project also serves on the expenses of fuel costs as cabbage collecting tracts need not to move from door to door to collect trash, instead trash will be delivered right to them. At a much less cost,compared to the fuel cost

> Technical Feasibility

The chute is made up of three containers (organic,inorganic and the non- biodegradable container) which automatically collect trash according to the category using reverse airflow. The interiors of the chute are made up disinfecting substances which disinfect the trash as it travels through the pipes. It is also made up of sensers that detect the category of the trash, in order for it to be directed in the container.
The similar prototype is that of garbage chutes

> Anticipated Social Impact

The invasion aims at making life easier to live for people, in the sense that, the garbage collection company need not to direct workers to move from door to door to collect trash instead they'll have to collect trash from our central collection points, helping them to save on costs.
The uses different forms of energy according to the season, amongst these are hydro-electric energy, solar energy as well as the energy which will be generated from the collected plastics(fuel energy)
