## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Tactical urbanism practices are rarely adopted by local governments in Turkey. The spatial interventions pointed out a gap in participatory design approaches and enhanced the learning and institutional capacity in municipalities. We confirmed with the municipality that fast and practical participatory designs with lower costs can have a positive effect on urban life (1); Informing and involving the public in tactical urban practices is a key to the sustainability of the design and to do so the municipality and local NGOs can work in collaboration (2) Working in cooperation with the relevant departments of the municipality on the perception of space, ownership and communication created a road map for the applications to be made by the municipality in the future. In the post-tests of the two designed areas, we learned to use of the pallets as sitting areas was not fully understood, especially, the elderly people had difficulty using these seating areas. In the post tests, we realized that people are quite unfamiliar with using these free spaces, since they are designed differently from the classical parks and children's playgrounds built by municipalities. Increasing such practices may change the approaches to the use of free space. As a result of the surveys, we found a positive increase in indicators such as cleanliness, noise, aesthetics and safety, which affect the quality of life in each areas.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

IIn the beginning of the process, the term "tactical" was not understood fully by our local counterparts. However, it appeared that this was only a conceptual confusion that stemmed from trying something very unfamiliar. The most difficult part was to create a clear understanding and map out the process of operations with our local partners.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

engagement with locals, surveys, observation showed us the qualities, needs and desires of the people who live in the intervention area. Spatial data and users journeys are mostly used for the design of intervention areas that responded with the qualitative data we collected.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Ethnography has enabled us to understand the socio cultural structure, the context, social dynamics, needs and desires and strategies for constructive communication ground. Co-creation and participatory design will ensure citizens' and municipality's active involvement in the design of the public space.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Urban Tank: An independent design collective provides specific implementation design based on Sotonoba's concept as an implementation partner for one of the intervention areas.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Sotonoba: Sotonoba brings various examples and a final concept design based on the design challenges and community needs regarding project areas. JIN facilitates the collaboration between AccLab and Sotonoba.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Karsiyaka Municipality in İzmir provides suitable locations for implementation and a dedicated design team to collaborate on data collection, implementation design, and field coordination.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Municipalities will be the main beneficiary here, but citizen initiatives/CBOs/NGOs will also benefit as they will be introduced to new ways of participating in decision-making and other aspects of urban life.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?
