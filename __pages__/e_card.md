ACTED Libya is innovating its unconditional multipurpose cash assistance programme with the introduction of prepaid debit cards which can be used to purchase essential items at over 900 points of sale across Libya. With the e-card programme, beneficiaries now have immediate access to cash in a country where bank facilities are limited.
