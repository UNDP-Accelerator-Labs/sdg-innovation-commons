Our primary mission is to provide useful information regarding health facilities for the citizens of North Macedonia. The idea of affordable healthcare as a basic right of every person is an inspiration to introduce a solution to the problem at noticeably different prices in different establishments or pharmacies. We are aware that the most vital importance for citizens are the ways to save their time and money, that's why "Najdi Apteka" introduces a price comparator that sorts searched products from the cheapest to the most expensive, with an inserted supplement - optimal calculation of fuel costs if the user choose that you would use a certain type of motor vehicle.
