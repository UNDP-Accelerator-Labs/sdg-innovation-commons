> Title of the innovation

The sensitivity of the covid 19 Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) test kits: a comparative study in paediatrics and geriatrics

> Brief description of the innovation

I want to compare the sensitivity of the Determine covid test kits in terms of its ability to pick the infection in children (&gt;5 yrs) and adults especially the aged

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The results of this study will help to devise more methods of texting for covid 19 before the standard PCR. This will help reduce the waste of test. This study will also underscore to elucidate the different covid variants and how they affect the different age groups. this will in turn help policy makers in their quest to deal with the scourge.

> Technical Feasibility

Have of late seen a vast shift in the way these kits test for covid 19. There has been a paediatric positivity predominance lately. The assumptions therefore are:
1. New variant of covid 19
2. The variant is largely in the children 
3. The kits are more sensitive to oral swabs
4. Kits don't pick the new variant on nasopharyngeal swab

> Anticipated Social Impact

There will be need to come up with new kits for the new variant. This will increase the chances of having not to miss the covid 19 infection. This will in turn help policy makers and hence reduce misapplication and wastage of funds.
