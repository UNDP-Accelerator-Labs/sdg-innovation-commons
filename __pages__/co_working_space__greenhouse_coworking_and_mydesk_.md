Provides people from various professional backgrounds a comfortable space to work, with internet access, particularly convenient at a time when more people are working remotely due to COVID19 pandemic restrictions.

This was first introduced in Fiji by The Greenhouse Studio founder and director, Maria Ronna Luna Pastorizo-Sekiguchi. Coworking spaces are shared workspaces, made affordable for those starting up a new business, entrepreneurs, consultants, freelancers, and small teams because the cost of running an office and all amenities is also shared by the members of the space.

The co-working space is an innovative solution as it is very relevant to the current challenges facing MSMEs in the country.

Additionally, in the current socio-economic context, working remotely and/or in isolation for long periods of time can become emotionally/ mentally overwhelming, so having a supportive community both virtually and in person is important.
