These are mats made from sweet/ candy wraps. Sitting mats are an important part of the Swazi Culture. They are normally made from a grass known as  lukhwane that are a wetland species. They are used in many traditional ceremonies including as important gifts to the groom and his family during weddings, and as an important material used during the burial of a loved one (normally a senior male family member). Local women have now started making them from many forms of plastic waste including single use plastic shopping bags, sweet wrappers and many other single use plastic material. this solutions therefore provides a recycling avenue for this type of waste while also helping to improve local incomes.
