> Type of the Solution

Innovative technology

> Description of the solution

Phase change material (PCM) utilise air temperature between night and day. In the daytime, incoming external air is cooled by the PCM-storage module, which absorbs and stores its heat by changing its phase state, e.g solid to liquid. At night-time the substance reverts to solid form, releasing its heat by being cooled by the now cooler external air.
