> Title of the innovation

Mobile ultrasound scanning services in Rural parts of Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation is about offering mobile ultrasound scanning services targeting pregnant women residing in rural parts of Zambia who have no access to affordable ultrasound scanning services.The innovation is aimed at reducing the maternal mortality rates through early detection, treatment and prevention of maternal related conditions.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income for me and my team and it will also create jobs for the unemployed radiologists and radiographers. The income will be coming from the fees pregnant women will be asked to pay to access our services.We intend to be charging atleast a k50 per patient with a waiver for those who can't afford to pay.
The challenge prize will enable us to buy more ultrasound scanning machines and a motor vehicle to ease our movements as we offer this service to pregnant women living in marginalized areas.

> Technical Feasibility

We're currently doing this project,we have satellite clinics where we go to offer our services every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays during antenatal visits but we are handcuped due to logistical challenges we face in trying to offer this service to our people.We only have one ultrasound scanning machine and that entails that we have to be in different locations at the same time which is quiet difficult.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will reduce maternal mortality rates through enhanced routinely screening of pregnant mothers,massive sensitization of pregnant mothers in rural communities on the importance of seeking the services of a qualified medical personnel earlier during the period they're pregnant through up to childbirth,women will be taught on the importance of avoiding harmful traditional practices that can put their lives and lives of the unborn babies at stake,e.t.c
This innovation will bring quality health care services in this regard, ultrasound scanning services as closer to the people as possible thereby making their lives better.
