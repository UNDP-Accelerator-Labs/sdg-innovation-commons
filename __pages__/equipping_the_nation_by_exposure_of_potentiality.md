> Brief description of the innovation

The strategy I have is to start a five year program with ten people who are to be trained in tailoring and upon completion they will be employed for experience 's sake. Thereafter, aiming to open one Centre of such in each province of Zambia. I would like to incorporate this with other activities to accommodate many especially the youths. Some centers will do agriculture and there will be somebody to train them. In short it is all about accommodating many skills through education with the idea of making sure they have what to do after training and looking into market for their products.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Selling of school uniforms and other services we will be  offering to clients , through tutoring of skills... Tailoring. My aim is to acquire advanced sewing machines and to train students to international standards so as to reduce on imported garments, for example I will make golf shirts and print them using my machine and I trust by the fifth year of this, l will have accomplished.

> Technical Feasibility

In my plan I selected two things to start with one, is tailoring as a skill and the second one is agriculture. To begin with, I have four sewing machines which I will use to train ten students at the center I will open. After they are equipped with the knowledge and skills in tailoring, they will be employed to work on the orders acquired through massive marketing from all over the nation. For the business to do well, it will need much support because it is for the benefit of the citizens and Zambia as a nation and only supporting Lusaka is enough to sustain other centers to be opened the remaining provinces. When fully convinced that the center is well established in a specified the next will be Northern province for agriculture using the same strategy thereafter the one that will respond faster through coordinators who will be set in each province for easier network. The centers may not necessarily offer all but mostly identify what is best for it's people and train them using right experienced tutors.if students are willing to learn but are unable to pay, agreements will be made. Each center will support the other be established.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Job creation and reduction of people's headaches to make orders from abroad. The higher the demand the higher the production and more people needed to do work
