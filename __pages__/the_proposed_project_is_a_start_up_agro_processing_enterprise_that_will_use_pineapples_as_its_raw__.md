> Title of the innovation

The proposed project is a start-up agro-processing enterprise that will use pineapples as its raw materials and state-of-the-art machinery for processing. The enterprise will also use qualified and skilled manpower and appropriate technology to produce high quality products that can satisfy the expectations of targeted customers continuously.

> Brief description of the innovation

Sandowa Pineapple Products Limited plans to establish a small ultra-modern factory to be located in Mwinilunga Township of Mwinilunga District in North Western Province – Zambia. The factory will carry a single processing line that will comprise of state-of-the-art machinery to be acquired from Shanghai Jimei Food Manufacturing Limited based in China. The rated production capacity (installed capacity) is 5 tons per hour of raw material. Working an 8 hours shift per day and 6 days in a week the factory will consume 960 metric tons of pineapples per month.
The plant will initially operate at 60% of the installed capacity in the first year. The capacity utilization will rise to 100% in the 5th year and onwards. It is projected that capacity utilization will be rising steadily each year of operation due to skills gained through experience in plant operation and as well as increase in raw material production as farmers expand their farms as a result of the ready market incentive to be provided.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The fundamental objective is to become a viable, vibrant profit-oriented pineapple processing enterprise that will produce high quality juice concentrate, pulp and pineapple fruit nectar in order to remain a reliable source of supply for pineapple based products to customers and markets so as to create wealth for the enterprise and its promoters and support pineapple growers in the process.
The Technical objectives include;
 To produce quality products at the right time when they are needed by customers.
To produce quality products at the correct quality level that meets the customers specifications.
To produce quality products in the right quantities to satisfy customer’s demand.
To produce quality products and supply at the right price which is affordable by customers and ensure a win-win situation.
The social objective will be contribute to poverty reduction among pineapple growers by increasing Farmers’ household incomes through the provision of access to a ready and reliable market for pineapple fruits and agreeing on a commodity price that ensures a win - win situation.

> Technical Feasibility

There are presently no companies in Zambia that are processing fruits to produce juice concentrate and pulp as raw materials for the juice and jam processing industries.
There is, however, a presence of companies producing juices, jams, chunks and rings and not necessarily companies that provide raw materials for these products. Juice and jam producers in Zambia are now sourcing their raw materials from import sources based in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Egypt.
Owing to the absence of a company that is able to process fruits into juice concentrate and pulp as industrial raw materials many companies have resorted to using syrups and flavourants rather than pure fruit juice.
Based on the foregoing the fruit juice processing industry in Zambia can be rated as attractive owing to its potential profitability and lack of competition. There is hardly any competitive rivalry in the fruit processing industry where raw material production is concerned.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Pineapples are one of the healthiest fruits around. Pineapple fruits, concentrates and other pineapple based products have a whole range of benefits that can increase health of the consumer. The fruit is a storehouse for several unique health promoting compounds, minerals and vitamins that are essential for optimum health.
The fruit contains a mixture of enzymes called Bromelain that block the production of kinins that form whenever there is inflammation in the body.
Pineapples are sugar free natural healing fruits. The fruit is an excellent source of antioxidant vitamin; vitamin C of which 100 g fruit contains 47.8 to 80% of this vitamin. It also contains fiber and thiamin. 
Pineapple fruit is rich in B-complex group of vitamins (B1 and B6) like folates, thiamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin and minerals like copper, manganese and potassium. These ingredients are important for immunity, digestive system and anti-inflammatory effects.
Pineapple helps to cure dyspepsia, which is chronic digestive disturbance, bronchitis, high blood pressure, diphtheria, catarrh and arthritis. 
Pineapples grown in Mwinilunga and Ikelengi are produced naturally in a natural environment without application of artificial fertilizers. This will ensure that consumers are supplied with specialty non toxic organic pineapple fruits and pineapple based products that promote increased good health for all consumers.
