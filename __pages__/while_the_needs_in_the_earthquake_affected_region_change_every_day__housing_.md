## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. While the needs in the earthquake-affected region change every day, housing, transportation, access to services, and employment remain the biggest challenges.

2. Migration and mobility persist both within and outside the city. Those who often remain in the earthquake-affected region are a poorer population with no other place to go. Additionally, some of the organizations and volunteers going to the region for reconstruction and development purposes seem likely to stay there for an extended period.

3. Cultural heritage, especially abstract cultural heritage, is overshadowed by recently made planning decisions.

4. In order for decisions made at a higher level to be effective at the local level, applications must be developed in collaboration with local stakeholders.

5. The use of open-source data, access to it, and the development of geographic information systems are issues that need to be addressed in the near future.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We created a map for potential projects within CO and AccLab for future work in the earthquake area.

> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.


the report and maps will be online soon with blog posts.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Academic literature: Utilized to enrich findings with numerical research and conceptual frameworks.

Solutions mapping: Employed to understand local actors, solutions, and potentials.

Geospatial data: Used to produce an up-to-date map of the earthquake-affected region and visualize the collected data.

Interviews: Utilized various interview methods to compile stories.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

This research aims to have two innovative dimensions. The first is to establish a connection between local communities and post-earthquake recovery, conducting a search for unusual partnerships to identify potential intervention directions. The second involves enhancing community resilience by generating open-source geospatial data using Mapillary, creating collective maps, and providing training on how to update maps.
