## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring bystanderism and victim relocation in cases of domestic violence
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that, despite the increasing incidence of gender-based violence (especially intimate partner violence) in Trinidad and Tobago, the availability of resources is declining, exacerbating the depth and breadth of the problem.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Statistics from the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service indicate that there was a 140% increase in the reports of GBV since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.  The increase is attributable to a number of factors including partners in volatile living situations being home together for longer periods, economic frustration and job losses within homes and in some cases, frustration over longer times spent home-schooling children. This has been compounded by a spate of deaths between 2020 and 2021 related to violence against women which included intimate partner violence, kidnapping, rape and murder. It is against this backdrop that the issue of bystander inaction in the face of the gender-based violence (GBV) scourge is one that needs to be properly understood and interrogated in order for impactful and sustainable interventions to be made. In 2019, the United Nations (UN), in collaboration with the European Union (EU) has launched the Spotlight Initiative, a multi-year programme aimed at addressing all forms of violence against women and girls (VAWG), and harmful practices. It will follow a transformative and evidence-based approach, addressing unequal power relations between men and women and focusing on gender equality and women's empowerment, as well as ending impunity for VAWG. In line with the principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Initiative will follow a human rights-based approach and take into consideration the specific needs of women and girls who experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and uphold the principle of 'leaving no one behind.' The initiative includes behavioural insights into stimulating positive male action to protect women and other victims of domestic violence.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is exploring the use of the internet to empower victims, especially with regard to finding shelter, and social/ behavioural nudges to combat bystander inaction.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Lab and the Spotlight Initiative are poised to begin conversations with victims, charities and special-interest groups and bystanders to gain behavioural insights on what intervention points may be developed.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

We are still planning discussions with all partners. Nevertheless, building upon the work of the SPOTLIGHT Initiative, the Lab is going to initially focus on understanding the behaviour of bystanders and relatives in cases of intimate partner violence and on a system for keep track of the available resources of shelters and support systems on an almost real-time basis.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

(1) What factors motivate bystanders to take action/not take action? How can these be turned into social nudges? (2) To what extent can victims of intimate partner violence be relocated swiftly if a proper, centralised and accessible inventory of resources is available?
(3) What is the most relevant method of strengthening early reporting and response?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioural insights will be used to determine when bystanders react and when they do not. We hope to be able to identify messaging that prompts safe and wise action.  Crowdsourcing will be used to identify the facilities that are available as shelters and safehouses on a real-time, yet confidential basis. Ethnography will be used to capture behavioural insights along with analysis of social networks that support bystander interventions.  By solutions mapping we will identify what signalling and triggers have worked in the past, including social media.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are still in the exploratory phase. We are not yet sure what data exist but given that the area is new (i.e. behavioural insights for bystanderism and citizen involvement in real-time update of info on safe houses and shelters); it is likely that all data will be new to the UNDP and to Trinidad and Tobago.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The charities and CSOs working with victims of intimate partner violence and the national police service will be the most immediate growth partners for our activities.
