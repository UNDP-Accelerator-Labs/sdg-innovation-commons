Palace Food Processing and Distributors

> Brief description of the innovation

Palace Foods Processing and Distributors is an organic-herb-centered company, specializing in a multiplicity of an assortment of herbs numbering about thirty in total. We grow organic herbs, resulting in non-chemical fertilizer usage in the growth process. The company has two compost pits, where we throw leaves left over vegetables and lawn trimmings, both of which are used interchangeably with horse manure throughout the year to fertilize the plants. In addition, garlic is planted in between plants to act as an insect appellant. The company also maintains neem trees and confree plants, whose leaves are soaked in drums of water for a couple of days for watering the plants twice a month. The combination of the two also acts as a fertilizer, while wading off insects, which has been super cost-effective, and hence leaving the herbs 100% organic and thus providing the needed nutrition for the human body.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The company has gone commercial with the majority of its clientele being chain store, including Spears and Freshmark, a few to mention, where it supplies the herbs on a daily basis. Our buyers thus end up saving on shipping expenses of the same from South Africa that they used to  make their orders from. The close proximity between the supplier and the buyers means that the products arrive at the stores for distribution to their various locations fresher than if they were outsourced from South Africa. Our target market are chain stores with the health-conscious consumers being the ultimate end-users and target for the chain stores. 

Different herbs provide different health benefits to the human body. For instance,  basil helps fight inflammation in the body, reducing risks of arthritis, heart disease, and bowel issues; dill reduces cholesterol levels, leads to reduction in heart diseases and stroke; parsley is rich in antibacterial properties while coriander is rich in immune-boosting antioxidants; rocket contains properties that protect eye health and against cancer while mint improves brain function. Garlic chives wad off insects, and all herbs are a medicinal impact on the environment

The challenge fund shall help solve scalability challenges.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation in question is a suite of 30 different types of herbs as could be seen from the pictures submitted herein. The implementation plan centers on the availability of land for planting the herbs, and market penetration techniques using a multiplicity of go-to-market strategies, including newspapers and radio, etc.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Since all herbs have medicinal benefits including cancer, as illustrated above, the ever rising cancer cases in the country in this case would be reduced and prevented. The health benefits of the herbs make the products relevant to the market.
