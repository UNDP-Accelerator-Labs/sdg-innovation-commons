This solution based on the NFC technology inserted on a traditional wristband will help have all the information to find and save a missed child. The solution makes it possible to prevent the short or long disappearance of children, a phenomenon that is quite widespread in Senegal. The child wears this very harmless bracelet which will help find him very quickly when it is necessary.
