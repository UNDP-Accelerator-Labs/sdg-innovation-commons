## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Isa da Costa

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

10/08/2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Digitalization and public service delivery

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Access to basic and quality public service delivery

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How might we bridge the digital divide through digital support systems?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

UNDP Governance Cluster, Ministry of Justice, CAJ (Center for Access to Justice) provate sector: SAUDIGITUS and NOSI
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We would like to learn what role digital support systems (digitalization of the processes in Centers for Access to Justice and the Courts) can play to bridge Digital Divide in the Ministry of Justice, focusing on the production of real time statistics for more informed decision making. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H2 “IF… data is collected digitally THEN… it will be easier to produce real-time statistics which can lay the ground for informed decision making”. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The first phase will focus on digitalizing and digitizing existing documents from CAJ, the criminal register and the tribunal of Buba, that are still on paper. Training and digital devices will be provided to staff who also will be part of the digitalization process and continue to feed the system when the test is over. When every document is digitized, the data will be connected to the information system SIGDAJ (locally developed solution). When all processes from the tribunal and CAJ of Buba are digitized, H2 will be tested by comparing what kind of statistics are available, before and after digitalization of data. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

AccLab will analyze what kind of statistics are available before and after digitalization and digitization of the processes in CAJ and the Tribunal.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation of statistics available

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 weeks 

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Collaboration, building trust with partners and preparation of field trip approximatley: 3 months. Actual field trip and experiment: 2 weeks  The experimental activity was fully covered by the UNDP Governance Cluster
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

N/A

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2-3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

The Governance Cluster paid the whole activity at an amount of: 17.000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, the next test will involve the creation of a digital platform that can be accessed by citizens anywhere at anytime to download their criminal register. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, the experiment is planned to be scaled with the Governance Cluster, the Ministry of Justice and our partner NOSI, from the Cape Verdean private sector.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

- The majority of staff in CAJ and the Court  have never received any form of digital training (92%).  - Digital training and equipment has the potential to improve attitudes thowards digitalization (pre-post survey) - The close colaboration with the Ministry of Justice and the UNDP Governance Cluster as well as with the private sector has showed a great potential for continuation and scaling. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Bureaucracy and internal politics (especially inside the Ministry of Justice), created obstacles and delayed our activities.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Governance Cluster in particular as the activity has been a support for their ongoing objectives and activities. All Clusters can learn from this activity as it shows the potential of a multisectorial team and close collaboration between the Lab, the Clusters, and the public and private sector.  

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministries, as it shows the potential of bridging the digital divide through the provision od digital support systems, as well as how a test can be done without investing too much time or resources. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Not at this point. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Make sure to create close colaboration with the Ministry and the UNDP Cluster in question, has showed a great potential for continuation and scaling. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

We beleive this experiment has a high replicability in the other SDG areas, ex with SDG 3 Good Health and Well Being, one can imagine providing digital support systems to make possible the production of real time statistics for more informed decisionmaking as well as centralization of data from hospitals and health centers. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We spend a lot of time on the "explore" phase for this experiment. In order to optimize time, we often split the team. In the future I would liek to work closer to the other roles for a more dynamic process. 

> What surprised you?

The strong synergy and commitment of the team that was put together.
