## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



“Act Green Challenge”


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Limited public awearness and education: Overcoming the challenge of limited public awareness is critical for effective waste management. The limitted awareness about the significance of proper waste disposal, recycling, and waste reduction often hinders sustainable practices. This can lead to improper disposal practices, such as littering and dumping waste in public areas. 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Algeria, there exists a pressing need to address the limited public awareness and education concerning waste management practices and the concept of the circular economy. Many individuals are unaware of the environmental impacts of improper waste disposal and limited knowledge of effective waste sorting and recycling methods. This limited awareness has contributed to ongoing challenges such as the improper disposal of waste, leading to pollution and resource depletion. Moreover, the circular economy—a sustainable model that focuses on repurposing waste materials—remains a relatively unfamiliar concept among the general population.

 

Supporting the efforts of gouverment, the National Waste Agency, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Algeria, introduced the idea of a challenge aimed at raising awareness and education on integrated waste management and the circular economy. The challenge seeks to leverage the power of engaging and educational videos and interactive digital games to effectively communicate the significance of responsible waste disposal practices and the potential of the circular economy. By inviting participants to develop creative content centered around waste reduction, recycling, and the circular economy, the challenge aims to inspire behavioral change and foster a better understanding of sustainable waste management practices among the Algerian population.



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Raise public awareness: The submitted solutions should address specific aspects of waste management, such as waste sorting, recycling, waste reduction, or the importance of waste valorisation. The goal is to raise public awareness about these issues and promote responsible behaviours.



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



As part of the second edition of the “Green Entrepreneurship Week”, the National Waste Agency in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Algeria will launch a national Challenge on E-awareness and E-learning focused on developing the best content for waste management awareness. 

 

This Challenge is an initiative aimed at promoting awareness of waste management through creative video content and/ or educational digital games. It will provide a unique opportunity for talented videographers and developers to share their vision and impactful message to encourage behaviour change and raise citizen awareness about waste reduction, sorting, recycling, and valorisation.
