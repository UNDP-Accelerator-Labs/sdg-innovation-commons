## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Plastic waste management- Reducing the use of single-use plastics in retail outlets
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

There is lack of plastic waste management protocols in Lesotho including  the uncontrolled plastic production, importation, and usage.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Waste disposal is a major problem in Lesotho leading to indiscriminate dumping on roadsides, market, and other public places. In a recent report by the UNEP it was depicted that the waste management situation in Lesotho is exacerbated by absence of waste management system, insufficient and informal collection system and widespread use of random and illegal dumpsites in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, with specific, reference to Maseru, another report also noted that the prevailing waste management practices were unsustainable as they damage the city’s natural resources (including its drinking water supply), threaten the health of residents, grazing land and also being wasteful with regard to potentially reusable and recyclable resources. The government through Ministry of Local Government, Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture, the private sector, local NGOs, communities and youth groups are also involved as both drivers of the challenge and the anticipated stakeholders to solve waste disposal challenge.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The media reports on the environmental and health hazards that have been caused by the dumpsite that is in the capital Maseru due to an uncontrolled dumpsite. There are also illegal dumpsites that are mushrooming all around the country. One other observation is that of waste left unattended along the streets and communities.   http://www.bos.gov.ls/new%20folder/Environment%20and%20Energy/2013_Solid_Waste_Water_and_Sanitation.pdf  Stop Open Waste Burning (unitar.org)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the tourism sector was greatly affected globally and Lesotho is no exception. In the case of Lesotho, tourism has been identified as one of the economic driver. During the covid-19 era, there has been an increase in the use of plastics (i.e the use of PPE) and other biodegradable materials. the increase of plastic use will further affect the tourism sector that is slowing trying to resuscitate from the impacts of covid-19. The economic potential of tourism will be impacted as plastic pollution will pollute the beautiful scenic landscape of Lesotho. this solution will assist  resuscitate the sector

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture (MTEC) provides technical support and relevant information to enable smooth engagement and implementation with government and private sector entities.  MTEC also envisage scaling up the experiment to unearth more evidence that can influence waste management regulatory frameworks and policies that are currently at initial stages.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

the lab need to understand the ecosystem better and know the different actors in the plastic waste sector. The learning question is if we can change the behavior of people on the use of plastics as well as finding alternatives to plastic that can be used, while creating employment

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Gather more insights for scaling as well as assisting in the mapping of solutions that currently exist. The methods will be used by having stakeholder meetings and mapping.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is currently no data/limited in relation to plastic and waste management  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The government through the ministries of tourism and local government will benefit from this challenge as they are the ones mandated to deal with waste management in Lesotho. The challenge might assist in the implementation of the proposed plastic levy which will lead to revenue increases for the country. To also grow the challenge, there is need to work with youth groups and community organizations. There are organizations that are already working on plastic waste management, they can provide economic opportunities for youth and women, leading to reduction in youth unemployment
