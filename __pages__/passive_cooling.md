> Description of the solution

Innovative strategies at the Universidade Agostinho Neto 
were employed to promote natural ventilation and 
passive cooling in all buildings with the exception of the 
library which is located underground. Landscape was 
advantageous and trees were arranged in a linear order 
to create a tunnel through which prevailing winds would 
blow from the southwest. Even the positioning of these windows can have passive cooling effects through cross-ventilation, or the aligning of windows to facilitate air circulation. Notable examples of cross-ventilation include Louisiana shotgun houses, which minimize interior walls that may obstruct horizontal drafts.

Universidade Agostinho Note
The classrooms of UAN are arranged in a grid such that they are angled 19 degrees off the north/south axis thus assuming the ideal orientation to maximize in natural lighting as well as natural ventilation. The roofs of the classrooms are designed with natural ventilation in mind, calibrated through computer dynamics to minimize solar gain as well as maximizing pressure differences to draw breezes through the classrooms. Invented by Perkins+Will Architects.
