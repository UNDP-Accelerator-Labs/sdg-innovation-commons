> Title of the innovation

Broiler Chicken rearing

> Brief description of the innovation

My Innovation is the rearing of broiler Chickens. My poultry house is nearly complete with about 90% of the construction work done. The poultry house can accommodate up to 150 broiler Chickens.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Broiler Chicken rearing is a very profitable venture. For example, the amount of circulation capital required in order for me to raise 100 chickens is approximately K5000. This amount covers 8 50kg bags of feed and a 100 day old chicks at K16 each. The price of a grown broiler Chicken in my community is K130, therefore a 100 birds will earn me K13000, producing a profit of K8000.
The challenge price will help me jump start and grow my business as it will provide me with circulating capital.

> Technical Feasibility

I have a poultry house which can accommodate 150 chickens though I wish to start with 100 chickens. Within 6 weeks of growth time, 100 chickens can consume 8 50kg bags of feed. This 8 bags of feed includes 2 bags of starter feed at K480 each, 3 bags of grower feed at K450 each and 3 bags of finisher feed at K430 each. A day old chick costs K16 each and therefore 100 day old chicks will cost K1600. Therefore the total capital required is K5200.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will ensure the availability of broiler Chickens so as to meet the high demand in my community. I can boldly say, this innovation is very much relevant because there is a high demand of broiler Chickens as food on the current market.
