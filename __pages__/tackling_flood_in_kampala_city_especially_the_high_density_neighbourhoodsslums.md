## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. The community is critical in solving its problems. We used Community Engagements to design an appropriate and sustainable waste management system. The tenants were willing to work with the landlords to collect money and hire private waste management collectors to collect their garbage. However, the community needs to be supported in the waste management behaviour to sort waste appropriately and take it to respective waste management centers like recycling plants for plastics and biodegradable to landfills. We are still working on this experiment for more lessons.

2. Following the Kampala Drainage Master Plan by Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) using the Crowd Mapping to generate a baseline map with key drainage systems, was critical. We carried out this experiement  and covered the following;-

i) Survey, map and design a total of 8 tributaries in Kiggundu and Sebina Zones, connecting them with the existing main drainage channel. Designs must comply with the technical, legal, and social requirements, aligning with the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) drainage master plan and stormwater management. 

ii) Drafted and final designs are subject to discussion and approval by the community, UNDP, Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), and National Environment Management Authority (NEMA).

iii) Collaborate with the community to construct the designed tributaries, employing cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and durable solutions.

iv) Construction activities will include the following;-

- Installation of appropriate culverts to allow a smooth flow of water. The tributaries should also connect to the main drainage systems.

- Desilt the main drainage channel to allow for a smooth flow of water collected from the drainage tributaries to the Lubigi channel.

- Establish a green belt comprising trees, flowers and grass alongside the drainage channels.

- Conduct community sensitization sessions on the importance and ways of maintaining an effective drainage system. 





> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Our work is still in progress registering more lessons and as we conclude the experiments we will have a 
clear handover process. For now, we are working with our Nature, Climate, Energy and Resilient Team (NCER) for technical guidance and to ensure sustainability during handover.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used hydrological analysis, based on a 12.5m x 12.5m grid digital elevation model sourced from:
https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/aw3d30/index.html) was undertaken to delineate the
project site based on the existing Katanga channel and the identified outlet culvert at the
Kampala Northern Bypass (KNBP), where the Katanga channel feeds the Lubigi channel. This
analysis produced the general extent of the Katanga subbasin, extending to the top of the hills of Makerere, Mulago and Nakasero. The hills majorly contribute to the Katanga sub-basin run-off. The analysis revealed that run-off is directed to
the lowest-lying centre of the sub-basin and continues in a northward direction towards the
Lubigi channel. The hydrological analysis also identified the natural flow paths, termed tertiary
channels, and these extended away from the secondary Katanga channel in an East-west
direction.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Yes, it was necessary to apply all the above methods as they are critical in not only documenting the lessons but also to cause behavioural mindset change. We co-created the drainage channels with the community as they own the land through which the channels were to pass, with the KCCA as they are mandated in the execution of the Kampala Capital city drainage master plan and with the National Environment Management Authority as they are keen devising appropriate solutions that are not detrimental to the environment.

> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

KCCA is responsible for the physical planning and operations of the Capital of Uganda Kampala. This includes ensuring that the city has good infrastructure in terms of transportation, waste management as well as maintaining the drainage system in the city among other services. Together with the community, and other stakeholders, we co-created the drainage system with KCCA following the wider Kampala City Drainage master plan.  KCCA approved the designed drainage systems of the 2 zones.

This is charged with the responsibility of coordinating, monitoring, regulating and supervising environmental management in the country.

NEMA spearheads the development of environmental policies, laws, regulations, standards and guidelines; and guides the Government on sound environment management in Uganda. In doing this, NEMA contributes to social-economic development and wise use of natural resources, focusing on providing support to the Government’s main goal of ensuring sustainable development contributing to the National Vision, the National Development Plan (NDP), regional and global commitments including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

We are currently working with NEMA to conduct an environmental impact assesment to esure that the designed drainage system of the 2 zones Kiggundu and Sebina are not detrimental to the environment. This is still a work in progress, NEMA is yet to give a verdict on the designed systems before construction begins.

This is the very first unit of leadership in the community. We worked with the Chairpersons of the 2 zones Kiggundu and Sebina who together with their leadership helped to mobilize the community members to participate in this learning cycle. We obtained ethnographic data, and solutions and now going to implement together the construction of the drainage systems using community human resources.
