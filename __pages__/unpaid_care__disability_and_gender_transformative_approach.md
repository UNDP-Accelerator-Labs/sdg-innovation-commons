## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The purpose of the pilot in Bogotá D.C. is to reduce and redistribute unpaid care and support work and to guarantee the rights and empowerment of persons with disabilities, as well as women caregivers of persons with disabilities.

In coordination with the Bogotá Mayor's Office, the experiment will be conducted in the Care Blocks and Support Centers for People with Disabilities. The experiment is currently in the design phase. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the district care system is strengthened through the inclusion of support services, then the personal

autonomy of women caregivers and people with disabilities will increase.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

The Portfolio is integrated for three experiments that are proved with  women caregivers of people with disabilities and people with disabilities, who are generating caregiving burdens unnecessarily.

• Experiment 1. Integrated services and inclusive infrastructure. It is assumed that the district care system does not integrate support services or have effective communication channels for persons with disabilities. The

support centers do not integrate services aimed at women caregivers of persons with disabilities.

• Experiment 2. Dispersion and delivery of assistive devices. Assumes that support services for persons with disabilities are relatively expensive, which limits their access and use.

• Experiment 3. Behavioral science based on trust. Assumes that caregivers and persons with disabilities are wary of delegating care and/or accessing public support services.
