Waste Banks
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is improper waste management in many regions of Tanzania.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Tanzania is facing a significant challenge in managing waste generated in urban and peri-urban areas. Inadequate waste collection and disposal facilities, coupled with the absence of a proper waste management system, has led to the accumulation of waste in public spaces and natural environments, leading to environmental degradation and public health risks.

Additionally, the lack of income-generating opportunities for communities in the waste management sector has resulted in the proliferation of informal waste collectors and dumpsites, leading to unsafe and unregulated waste disposal practices.

The absence of an effective waste management system also poses a threat to Tanzania's economy and natural resources, as the country lacks the capacity to recycle and reuse its waste, resulting in the loss of valuable resources and increased greenhouse gas emissions.

Tanzania faces a severe waste management challenge that affects the environment, public health, and the economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Tanzania generates over 16 million tons of waste annually, with urban areas producing over 4 million tons of waste. However, only 58% of the urban waste is collected, and the rest ends up in streets, waterways, or uncontrolled dumpsites, posing environmental and health risks to the public.

In Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania, only 38% of the waste generated is collected, and the rest is illegally dumped in public spaces or uncontrolled dumpsites. The uncontrolled dumping of waste has led to air, water, and soil pollution, which poses health risks to the residents.

In Mwanza, the second-largest city in Tanzania, over 300 tons of waste is generated daily, but only 50% of the waste is collected, and the rest ends up in streets, rivers, or uncontrolled dumpsites. The uncollected waste has led to the proliferation of mosquitoes, which increases the risk of malaria and other water-borne diseases.

In rural areas, waste management is also a significant challenge, with most of the waste being burned or dumped in uncontrolled sites, leading to environmental degradation and loss of valuable resources. 

The lack of an effective waste management system has also affected Tanzania's economy, as the country loses over $200 million annually due to the lack of proper waste management systems that promote recycling and reuse. 

Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a sustainable waste management system in Tanzania, especially in urban areas, to promote the circular economy, reduce pollution, and create income-generating opportunities. The establishment of waste banks in Tanzania could be a viable solution to address the waste management challenge, as it would empower communities to manage their waste effectively and promote the circular economy. Tanzania faces a severe waste management challenge that affects the environment, public health, and the economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Tanzania generates over 16 million tons of waste annually, with urban areas producing over 4 million tons of waste.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Various studies have pointed out lack of appropriate data Tanzania solid waste managements systems to inform programming and decision making. There is minimal/ or no data related to 1) user opinions/views 2) number of households utilizing the system 3) willingness to pay for service 4) disaggregated solid waste type data 5) limited use of IT to link customers, aggregators. Collective intelligence ( Promoted perhaps by only the Acc Lab) through its methods therefore will help to generate new information that will lead to new ideas and hence help to embed new products or services that will improve the efficiency of the solid waste management systems in the city.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1) What are the key steps involved in establishing a waste bank in a community, and how can community members be trained to effectively manage their waste through waste segregation, composting, and recycling?

2) How can waste bank projects in Tanzania contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote the circular economy by creating income-generating opportunities for communities through the sale of recyclable waste?

3) What are the key factors that determine the success of waste bank projects in Tanzania, and how can partnerships between the local government, community-based organizations, and waste management companies be leveraged to ensure the sustainability of waste banking initiatives?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The innovation methods listed above can add significant value to the Waste Bank Project in Tanzania in several ways:

Empathy and User-Centered Approach: Design thinking involves empathizing with the target community to understand their unique needs and challenges. This can help ensure that the waste management solutions developed are tailored to the needs of the community and are more likely to be accepted and adopted. 

Generating New Ideas: Brainstorming and open innovation can help generate new ideas for waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. By collaborating with external partners or involving stakeholders in the brainstorming process, the project team can gain fresh perspectives and insights that can lead to innovative solutions.

Testing and Iteration: Lean Startup provides a framework for testing and iterating on waste management solutions on a small scale before scaling up to a larger community. This can help reduce the risks and costs associated with implementing new waste management solutions.

Data-Driven Improvement: Six Sigma involves analyzing data to identify areas for improvement and reduce waste and inefficiencies in processes. This can help optimize waste management processes to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Several data gaps may exist for the Waste Bank Project in Tanzania. Some examples are:

Waste Generation and Composition: The project may lack accurate data on the types and quantities of waste generated in the selected communities, which could impact the effectiveness of the waste management solutions implemented. 

Collection Efficiency: The project may lack data on the efficiency of waste collection in the selected communities, such as the frequency of collection and the percentage of waste that is collected. This information is critical for designing waste management systems that are tailored to the needs of the community.

Waste Segregation and Recycling Rates: The project may lack data on the rates of waste segregation and recycling in the selected communities, which could impact the viability of waste banking as a sustainable business model. 

Market Demand for Recyclable Materials: The project may lack data on the demand for recyclable materials in Tanzania, which could impact the pricing and marketability of the recyclable waste collected by the waste banks.

Financial Viability of Waste Banks: The project may lack data on the financial viability of waste banks, such as the costs of establishing and maintaining a waste bank, and the revenue generated through the sale of recyclable waste.
