## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Building creative community is the core if we want to accelerate development of creative industries in Kyrgzystan. (Experiment: CREATE4 - joint product of UNDP and Association of Creative Industries in Kyrgyzstan, more than 25 events over 2022, two national festivals of creative industries Partners: Association of Creative Industries, President's Administration, KyrgyzPatent (National Agency on Innovation and Intellectual Property), private sector) 2.  Creative economy (CE) has a wide range of innovative concepts for local development and urban development such as "creative placemaking" and methodologies such as "eventful cities" which might stimulate both social cohesion among diverse communities and income-generating opportunities through the use of technologies and human-centered approaches (Experiments:  1. Incubation for Creative Events; 2. OpenOsh digital city platform; Partners: Osh Mayor's Office, grassroots Communities of practice and NGOs.) 3. Due to existing gender-based stereotypes toward women especially in the rural areas, it is critical to design gender sensitive interventions if we want to engage more women into creative economy. (Experiment: Women Creative Lab; Partners: grassroot NGOs, private sector) 4. Experiments on creative economy is giving a wide range of opportunities for civic engagement based on the combination of urban development, creative skills, arts (Experiments: prototype of the Incubation for creative events; Partners: Osh Mayor's Office, grassroots communities of practice) 5. There is a gap in basic creative skills and knowledge among youths. If we can address this gap and decrease the negative impact of other factors influencing the youth engagement into creative economy, then youths will become more capable to learn professional skills and subsequently harness income opportunities in creative economy
