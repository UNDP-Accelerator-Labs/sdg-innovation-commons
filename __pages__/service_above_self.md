> Title of the innovation

SERVICE ABOVE SELF

> Brief description of the innovation

Ba Youth Multipurpose Cooperative aims at create a base for Youth economic zone where youths are empowered through the cooperative's chicken and stock feed production. We will use readily available resources from our local farmers to maximize profit in the production.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Poultry farming and stock feed production go hand in hand. There is currently huge shortage of broiler chickens on the market due to increasing prices of feed and the chicks, so the demand has also gone high. In our quest through the existing business of our Cooperative. We gone further in organizing resources which are readily available with our local farmers such as maize bran and soya beans. We started making our own feed two years, have gained experience, and the shortage of feed in stock had prompted us to pursue a robust approach in organizing resources and conducting feasibility Studies. The project, once implemented will cushion the impact faced by farmers because our prices will be reduced due to the availability of local resources, thereby putting us at a competitive advantage with our competitors.

> Technical Feasibility

We have put up a robust and systematic implementation plan in order to carry out project. One of things is that, we have ensured that all the resources are organized through the engagement of key stakeholders such as farmers through our workshops and business seminars. We have gone a step further by having a certain number of farmers to benefit from our feed production and our chickens are also part of the pilot study which is to help us get started before we widen the focus.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Consumers have reduced buying broiler chickens, some poultry farmers have stopped doing the business while others reduced the uptake of the number of chickens in keeping because of the unprecedented levels of rising prices of feed and the day old chicks themselves. The coming on board of the Ba Youth Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited will bridge the gap and provide cheaper feed which will consequently help them improve their business with good net profit. Consumers will start buying chickens without restraining their desire because the prices of feed will reduce. Chickens provide proteins which is essential in the human body.
