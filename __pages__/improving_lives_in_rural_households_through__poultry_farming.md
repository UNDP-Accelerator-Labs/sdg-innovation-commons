IMPROVING LIVES IN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS THROUGH  POULTRY FARMING

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation to be undertaken is all about improving livelihood of rural households through poultry farming. This involves keeping different breeds of chicken for sell. Like in the picture above, I keep black Astrolorp chicken layers. The chickens lay on a daily basis fertilized eggs which are on high demand for hatching chicks. This brings income to the household at a very affordable cost of keeping them as they are disease resistant and feed on maize brand which villagers can afford.
In line with the above, buying an incubator can be an added advantage so that one produces eggs and hatches to sell chicks to other farmers interested, thereby empowering others.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Like stated above, poultry farming is a new like a new landmine at the moment.  Rearing black Astrolorp Chicken layers is very profitable at an affordable output. Fertilized Black Astrolorp Eggs, are on high demand and selling at K150 zm Currence per tray.  This innovation or project  generates income for me as I Am able to sell 12 trays of fertilized eggs on a weekly basis @,K150 giving me K1800 weekly.  This business has a big likelihood of empowering small scale farmers buy buying an incubator and sell chicks to farmers to empower them. 
This business can be extended to even keep other breeds of chickens for meat like the Silver and brown sasol chickens whose market is readily available and the price for them is very good too since many people prefer village chicken to broiler for meat.
This undertaking has helped me and can also help poor families to better their lives financially as well health wise.

> Technical Feasibility

Designed to rear chickens for laying fertilized eggs for sell since I have no incubator at the moment. However I intend to buy an incubator so thati startsellong day old chicks.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation is very relevant to the current market as so many people are in demand of these Black Astrolorp Eggs for hatching chicks. The price for both eggs and chicks is very attractive. Hence can generate income for low income households.
