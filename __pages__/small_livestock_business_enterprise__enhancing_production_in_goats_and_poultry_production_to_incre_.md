> Brief description of the innovation

small ruminants are climate resilience to climate change and the period of production is 5 months and poultry productivity is in different phases which are broilers for 6 to 8 months sells.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

For small ruminants it's  5 months gestation  period and in a year you expect two kids  per year and if you have 100 female goats expect to have 100 kids in six months with good management. For poultry needs an incubator for hatching eggs.

> Technical Feasibility

To start with am animal scientist, did agriculture at NRDC and stay in Gwembe we have enough land for grazings goats and I have three poultry houses already..

> Anticipated Social Impact

we have a deficit of eggs in Gwembe, and others will be trained in small ruminants production and poultry and do some Pass on scheme to members also they start running their businesses with the knowledge learnt.
