Planet 3R is a social enterprise founded by Adejoke Lasisi and is dedicated to converting textile and plastic waste into eco-friendly products using the 3R method ( Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to save our planet by weaving them into innovative items. With the vision of creating a sustainable world without textile and plastic wastes, it became necessary for Planet 3R to reduce the landfill space by recycling clothes and plastic bags. As landfill sites are a threat to our environment as well as water supplies. Planet 3R creatively shred old clothes and used plastic (especially pure water sachets) then converts them into finished products using traditional weaving techniques. These finished products include fashion wears, home decors, bags, and accessories.
