## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We decided to use this project to test our main hypotheses related to the Returning Point

-        What will happen if we open new pathways of communication with the diaspora, potential returnees and all the successful individuals who have already returned to Serbia to work and live here?

-        What does a different kind of communication with a formal or informal tone mean for our diaspora?

-        How to centralize communication and create a quicker, more agile way of communicating with the Serbian Diaspora and providing them with useful information?

o   How useful are additional features (e.g. stickers, forums) in this way?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

·       If we gather all the diaspora and their representatives on an agile and popular communication informal platform and provide them with relevant content and gather feedback, then they will be more likely to have a greater connection to Serbia and will know where they will get information on Serbia.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

·       Rakuten Viber, as it is the most popular platform used in Serbia and within its diaspora, contacted Returning Point to create this group

·       Created “Dijaspora Srbija” channel

·       Used Returning Point Social media to promote the channel and attract Viber users

·       Received training from Rakuten Viber to familiarize with the platform rules, have effective communication and produce best content (e.g. brevity, using emoticons and stickers for best effect)

·       Posted relevant content (news about diaspora and Returning Point activities and programs) to a closed group of users

·       -- Used feedback to calibrate

·       Organized open days when new members can join and also when users can ask questions (Ask-me-anything style)

o   -- Used the group for testing various initiatives for Returning Point (e.g. asking for opinions and polls about having a dedicated section for parents on the website)

o   -- Crowdsourced ideas from the group for new initiatives

·       Later, opened the Viber group

o   -- To any new Viber member

o   -- Provided administration rights to other diaspora organizations (e.g. OSSI – Organization of Serbian Students Abroad, Nikola Tesla Academic network, ), who could provide suitable content

·       Kept up to date with Rakuten Viber features (creating stickers, creating specific topics that can be commented on)

·       Provided moderation throughout to remove inappropriate content (spam, sharing of personal information, etc.)

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

One Viber group with 4600 Viber members

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

·       User feedback 

·       Analysis of feedback

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

35 months (Ongoing since 12 October 2020)

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

·       Users are very keen to communicate and share their own ideas without prompt

·       It is good to provide a space for people to chat

·       Other Returning Point programs focus on the highly skilled diaspora:  this group is diverse and provides more open communication with various parts of the diaspora, which allows us to see commonalities of many problems

·       Moderation is crucial but is a time consuming process

·       Cooperation with other organizations was good as they were also able to provide relevant content

·       Even non-diaspora members of the group were useful in reaching diaspora as they would let their relatives in the diaspora know about events/issues

·       Diaspora and returnees are a diverse set of individuals with varied interests and the most effective communication is one that directly addresses common needs (e.g. practical law changes, financial benefits)

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

·       While Viber is the most used app in Serbia and among the diaspora and returnees, it can miss out on the users of other apps

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

·       Colleagues working on topics related to Migration, Depopulation, and connection with Diaspora, Returnees and Foreigners (in general)

·       Colleagues trying to change the narratives surrounding some issues similar to migration  

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

·       All members of the Viber group (cca 4600 members )

·       Other Diaspora organizations involved in this Viber group

·       Media representatives

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

·       The group was initially closed and then opened

·       While initially, it was only Returning Point who provided content, we gave the permission to other organizations to post and moderate content and discussions

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

·       Moderation is a crucial, but time-consuming and stressful process which requires immediate response whenever something inappropriate is shared

·       Content creation is also strenuous, and requires planning to ensure you can do it regularly

·       Collaboration with other organizations was useful as they were able to create their own relevant content and also promote the group to their members

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

·       Yes, for similar issues

> What surprised you?

·       Commonality of issues between our target audience (highly skilled diaspora and returnees) and Serbian diaspora and returnees in general
