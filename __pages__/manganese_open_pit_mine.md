> Title of the innovation

Manganese Open Pit Mine

> Brief description of the innovation

I’m based in Luapula, home of the richest natural resources like Manganese and Iron. Looking at the future of Industrial development, Mining is major contributor to both national income and sustainable youth empowerment. Opening a Manganese open pit mine with correct extraction methods as well as optimistic long term plans to fuel the project life, putting this in effect would create employment for thousands of locals, bring development to the surrounding communities and generate revenue for the national at large.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through successful mining, the extracted Manganese can be processed locally into finished products for the market or exported to other countries as raw material hence generating income. We may also sell to local businesses owners with Smelter plants ( eg Kanona in Serenje) in order to promote local trade for others to benefit. This would also benefit locally based business owners of transport and logistics companies, various mining associated firms dealing in mining equipment and assorted mining operations.

> Technical Feasibility

Using appropriate mining software and technology, an optimal open pit mine can be designed to maximize production of over 1000 tones per day. This can be achieved by putting on site high performing machines such as graders, excavators, dump trucks, drill rigs, fuel tanks, utility vehicles and proper infrastructure to facilitate operation throughout the year. 

Implementing this plan would set out by first conducting a thorough geological survey, explore the most potential areas and conduct geological mapping in order to come up with the most profitable open pit mine to yield the maximum production possible. Prior to this acquisition of area, the project would then require proper road networking systems and site infrastructure for workers in order to commence operations with all Mining Regulations put in consideration.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This would create employment for the locals, bring revenue to the local council, empower local communities with roads and infrastructure, create potential chances of local trade and improve the standard of living across the entire province. 
The project is of utmost importance because mining is the countries current source of revenue and it is one of the biggest platforms of employment as can be seen in other mining towns such as Kitwe, Chingola, Chililabombwe and Solwezi
