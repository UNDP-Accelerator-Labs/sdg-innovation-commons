> Title of the innovation

Simple water purifier ( SWP) this is a simple machine that is hand Crafted it's going to be used to to purify water and improve the water  and sanitary sector  it's going to Carter for the rural areas so as to improve the livelihood .

> Brief description of the innovation

My machine was made out a plastic bottle and some straws and some cloths which act as the Main water purifiers and so water containing dirty particles is poured in bottle and the water moves down the system and when it reaches the last phase it is purified for drinking and the water (H20) becomes useful  for the community and this machine can contribute to the economy of our nation in which machines like it and more improved can be sold to other countries with issues in the water and sanitary sector e.g Zimbabwe and it can also be a project to provide jobs for the youths on a small scale base.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

During the manufacturing of the machine youths can be given jobs to help assemble the machine  and hence help provide jobs  for individuals and when it sold out to countries  with issues to water management  and when even sold out to my fellow Zambians on an affordable price the money earned becomes my cost of salary for me and all the people involved in this visionary project.

> Technical Feasibility

As of yet my machine is of simple house hold equipments so my dream is to see to it that the machine is improved

> Anticipated Social Impact

It's going to improve the livelihood of people in Zambia especially the rural areas were my country zambia  experiences problems in the water sector , so it's going to improve the water make it clean for drinking for all the people of Zambia.
