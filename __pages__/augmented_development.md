## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To assess mindsets, stereotypes and preconceptions of participants, regarding left behind territories and their dwelers

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we stablish an indirect communication between "Unlinkely" or "Unexpected" actors, THEN it will increase empathy, aknowledgement and willingbess to help, which will reflect in solidary deeds.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Participants were divided into four groups: No exposition (who didn't take part in any of the activities), Pictures without Augmented Reality (This group experienced a photografic exposition, without the engament wiith the augmented reality experience), Augmented Reality Experience (this group used the mobile app to experience the AR features of the exposition. Later they left messages in a board), Breach reduction booth (There were two cabins, where the fourth group watched a video with the story of one the UNDP's programme beneficiaries. Later it is asked to shared their perspectives about the story, from the position of the protagonist. Finally, participants where asked to send a video message to the protagonist of the story. At the begining of the intervention, protagonists of the fourth group were given a token representing the SDG's, which they were free to decide whether to return or keep).

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Empathy, Group Identity, Control over self's life, Negative preconceptions, Attitudes towards inequalities, Willingness to donate

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

QUASI EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH= Quantitative Approach: Surveys (inquiring for different characteristics of the participants, as well as perceptions related with inequalities) Anova Analysis. // Quanlitative Approach: Audio analysis from the booth (here there where identified different trais of the protagonist), Message Board (there where gathered 53 messages from the participants, to left behind territories. The messages were mainly showing hope, empathy and generosity). Ideas to reduce inequalities (there were gathererd 101 proposals from 66 participants, cataloged within seven cathegories: education, social Justice and inequalities, wealth redistribution, employment, public policy, empowermnet of women and health).

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Tablets for the participants to be able to be part of the experience, Space, participation of beneficiaries of UNDP programmes in Colombia, research on tools and methodologies to measure empathy.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

No. It was proven the role of technologies in enhancing the empathy and changing the narrative about left behind territories. However, there is not absolute clarity of whether empathy and a deeper comprehension of how inequalities affect people will drive action from the participants (so in this component of the experiment there is not a final conclusion).

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

There were restrictions related with time ad space control. One of the recommendations is to repeat this experiment with stricter experimental measures. However, the participants had a positive experiece, and their output from the different dinamics was also positive, for what can be infered that the experimental approach was close to what was intended.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

15.000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. There are other empathy projects ongoing, using different tools: 1) The use of new technologies, such as drones and 360° cameras to share the challenges and experiences of crisis response in San Andres and Providencia (A group of islands destroyed by a huracane). 2) The development of the second version of the AR app, focused now on providing information to the users, about public institutions and infraestructure projects.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

This Experiment was not scaled.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

At the initial state there is not any specific feeling towards the communities that participate in the programmes. There was confirmed a different perception about the control over life between developed territories compared with left behind ones. There was found a double standard  towards living in remote places. Finally, There is a breach between the mindset towards inequalities and the willingness to asume direct costs to overcome this gaps, in this context.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Control over time and space (mainly because the experiment was held within the context of the Human Development Index launch event)

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Everyone. At all levels the office can use this sort of tools to have a deeper understanding of the communities and contexts in which UNDP holds and will hold projects and programmes. This experiment can provide with ways to enhance shared views of the challenges in left behind

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Policy makers mainly, but also everyone. The idea behind the experiment is to create bridges between people, places, actions and solutions happening in the territories, therefore this is a tool to enhance collective inteligence, specifically applied to promote human development

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

There were no iterations over this experiment, however the recommendarion would be to repllicate it in a more controlled setting within 5 experiments, to cover at least 300 people.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Design iterations adjusting them to specific contexts, relating it with challenges and the HDI.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. Since the experiment is focused on create empathy there are different settings where it could be applied, how ever the content of the experiment it self must be adjusted to context and final objective (application)

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Due the time we had available to design the experience and experiment, we had short time to “sense” and “explore”. We deployed and implemented tools that allowed us to configure the hypothesis and complement from the knowledge of a behavioral scientist.

> What surprised you?

Most of the learnings were surprises. We learned our hypothesis were very complex, and although we were able to obtain results, we had several hypotheses in one question. For our surprise, the “Augmented Development” experience is still a reference in the office and was the point of entrance to accelerate development with the use of technology.
