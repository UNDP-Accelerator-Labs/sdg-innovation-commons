> Title of the innovation

VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP STUDENT EXPERIENCE (VISE)

> Brief description of the innovation

With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with high unemployment levels, traditional physical internships are no longer a viable option for most students . A virtual internship therefore provides a great alternative. VISE is a virtual internship platform that will provide students work experience placements which they can do from their homes using their laptops. The virtual internship will provide students with the experience and skills to add to their CVs and enable them to build some employability skills and soft skills that Zambian employers are looking for. As an online platform, VISE will easily be accessible for most students and can easily be scaled to all parts of the country.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

VISE will generate income through placement fees. Employers and Universities will be charged a fee when student takes on an internship. The fees will borne by the institution requesting for an intern or requesting for an intern to be placed. VISE will ensure that employers have good quality placements with real work offer. The return on investment for educators is significant given that they compete for students and employability has become the number one factor considered by students when picking a programme of study. The Prize money will help us with finalising the development of VISE so that  it is an efficient online platform that is user friendly and can easily be integrated into related employer and university programme. Being  a virtual programme, VISE can help reduce the green house gas emissions through reduced transportation to and from work and through a reduction in paper use.

> Technical Feasibility

The concept is simply to connect employers and interns virtually. VISE will match employers all over the country with universities and other educational institutions that have students looking for internship opportunities. The business acts as an intermediary, effectively vetting both sides by ensuring employers are able to offer meaningful placements and helping them choose the right candidates for the job. VISE will also handle the administration of the internship, including monitoring placements to ensure that both the employer and the student are happy, and working with both parties to ensure they are able to make the most of the opportunity. We intend to conduct a pilot in the first part of 2022 with a number of employers from different sectors of the Zambian economy starting with the Lusaka province. We will then roll out the programme to other provinces in the second part of the year targeting over 1000 students and new graduates. We intend to place about 5000 students by the end of 2024.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With the ever rising numbers of youth unemployment, there is an urgent need for practical and innovative solutions to offer young people job opportunities.  Many young people see work experience and internships as the key to getting one foot into the world of work. This is because internships provide an opportunity for young people to build the much-needed soft skills that employers are looking for. The current employment market requires employees who are technologically savvy and easily adapt to the changing nature of work. With the rise of trends such as remote working and use of workplace technologies, the virtual nature of our internships will be a plus for most employers and will also provide universities an opportunity to address the skills mismatch between academia and the industry.  VISE will have a lot of advantages over the traditional internship model as there is a larger field of applicants who can participate, students can fit in other work while working independently, and it is an opportunity to easily collaborate with  various employers. The programme can also be easily rolled out as it is easily acccesible and scalable.
