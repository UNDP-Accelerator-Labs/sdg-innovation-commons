## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Citizens' knowledge about the public spaces in their neighbourhoods could be the key to their design and revitalisation. With this pilot, we wanted to learn about: a) the level of citizens' engagement, if they are provided with an opportunity to participate in urban transformation with their ideas, and, b) how the local government reacts to participatory design based on crowdsourcing of citizens' preferences and selection of urban development option proposal based on popular vote. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we enable collective and structured citizens' feedback and suggestions for the renewal or development of public urban spaces THEN architects will be able to develop people-centred, lively and sustainable conceptual designs.  IF we enable citizens to vote on the awarded conceptual designs THEN local government would have evidence on what design to implement.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We developed an urban transformation digital platform https://centar.urbanlab.ba/ which allowed the collection of the citizens' feedback on the future design of one public space in the Municipality of Centar. We also organized the same consultations with the citizens, but on-site. We learned that the digital consultation was superior to the on-site consultation.  Data on visitors to the platform and those who registered and submitted their answers is tracked. The comprehensive report on citizens' feedback became a part of the tender dossier for the international architectural competition. The solution proposed reflects citizens' preferences. We are soon to publish three winning solutions on the platform and invite citizens to vote and make their choice among those three solutions awarded by the international jury of professionals (architects and landscape designers).

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Citizens engagement,  Architects bidders interest in the process,  Municipality position to community-led local development

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Accelerator Lab and the team of architects, urban planners, illustrators, and software developers worked for some 6-8 months to design the inclusive urban spaces transformation process, organize on-site events for the urban redesign of multiple locations, develop a platform, and organize and implement an international architectural competition.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

IF we enable collective and structured citizens' feedback and suggestions for the renewal or development of public urban spaces THEN architects will be able to develop people-centred, lively and sustainable conceptual designs.   For location 1 (full urban transformation design process): Google Analytics shows that out of some 3100 visitors to the platform in the period when citizens were invited to provide their preferences on development options of the site, out of which 2200 came from Sarajevo, 405 registered and submitted their answers to the 13-questions survey. The high conversion rate indicates the genuine interest of the local community to have a say in the future design of urban spaces. The workshop organized on-site and utilizing the same participatory design method was not so well attended.  IF we enable citizens to vote on the awarded conceptual designs THEN local government would have evidence on what design to implement. For location 2 (before the development of the urban transformation platform, we conducted a typical process of devising urban design proposals, and then used our Open innovation platform for public voting on 4 proposals) the Municipality accepted the public vote from the citizens (although their initial stand was that they will not accept the particular solution which actually won the public vote) and right now the "main project document" for the street reconstruction is under development exactly for that solution.   

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

The process was iterative, so we discover some learnings month by month. The overal process lasts for some 6 months.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

We haven't spend Accelerator Lab budget, but mobilized UNDP TRAC2 resources to the amount of 110.000 USD, current commitments around 90.000 USD.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This experiment will end after the pilot voting process, where citizens will select their prefered option amongst the three designs (location 1) awarded through the international architectural competition. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The municipality we partnered with already asks for the use of platform for redesign of additional urban spaces. We also have interest of other couple of other municipalities. We designed the urban redesign process and platform that supports it as scalable to any interested municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also in line with procurement and other laws in the country.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The process works, and citizens are responsive to the opportunity to affect their neighbourhood's future look. On-site consultations are outdated: low turnout and a problem of very vocal people trying to push their agenda over the silent ones' opinions. Architects are surprised by the process as well - we received 79 applications for Location 1 redesign, which is much more than usual. We got many enquires on the process from that community as well. The municipality is open to extending this approach to other locations, and we have rising interest among other cities in the country. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Communicating the activites with the citizens (invitatitions to events) which is done by the municipality.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Anyone working with the local governments on the topics of citizens engagement in the contects of urban planning and design. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

A win-win situation for the local government (in terms of their public standing) and citizens who can now say how they imagine their park, street... and be confident that those in charge of designing solutions have to align their proposals with overall citizens' opinion. Citizens' overall feedback becomes a part of the tender dossier and an evaluation criterion in architectural competitions.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment can be replicated in any other local development area - as it puts the people experiencing a need or challenge in the driving seat. After focusing on what you want to change, you build trust and alliances with the people who can help that change happen and rely on local people's involvement to make sure their voices and needs are heard.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We actually haven't seen processes like this happening - some pilots are being implemented in developed countries, but we couldn't learn much from there.

> What surprised you?

If you make the process fully transparent and open for participation, citizens will respond. I was personally suprised by the number of conversions on the web site - from anonymous users visiting the site to registered users submitting a thirteen-questions architectural survey designed for the space to be transformed.
