Biogas: Experimentation on the potential of fish waste generated from the Oistins Market and Bay Gardens market in Barbados as well as other forms of organic waste in the production of bio-methane for energy and heating generation. This would potentially lower the cost of energy and heating for fish vendors, improve the livelihoods of women, lower the cost of operations for MSMEs and create a commercial operation.
