## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1.) Working with weather data and up-skilling in climate smart practices can improve small holder farmers yields by over 100%.

2.) Small holder farmers are greatly impacted by the effects of climate change, because their activities are greatly dependent on working with established weather patterns, for example most solely practice rain-fed agriculture and sun drying for preservation is very common.

3.) Some Farmers areas are more affected by dry weather shocks such as late onset rain, dry spells and prolonged drought, however flooding typically makes more headlines. 

4.) Small holder farming is a popular occupation and a major contributor to GDP in Nigeria, averaging about 20% over the last 9 years. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our work has not yet scaled
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We are working on the adoption of this experiment by 2 projects teams in our CO, and a collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture that incorporates the experiment model in 2024. We are also concluding with endline surveys, and will handover once these processes are complete. 
## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used these types of data because we wanted to be more certain that the methods we were introducing would be accepted by the small holder farmers, since they would be risking their livelihoods based on our advice. 

Some data types addressed gaps about upcoming weather patterns in the small holder farming communities. Others were vital for ensuring we had 2-way data flows between the farmers and other technical experts. The establishment of knowledge exchange platforms is crucial to the sustainability of this intervention. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods were necessary for identifying local assets, and resources that we could work with, to improve the sustainability of this experiment if it was successful. 

We also needed to understand the farmers' prioritisation of the systemic challenges that they were dealing with, so we could understand where our work would have greater impact.

A collective intelligence approach was necessary, because there were many variables to address on this experiment and this was our best bet for designing a practical solution.
