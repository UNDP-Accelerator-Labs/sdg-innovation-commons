1. Technical support from National University of Lesotho, contribution of two software developers to undertake development of the application.

2. Provision of free internet access through zero-rating process by Econet Telecom Lesotho. The company also provided 25% off on acquiring of tablets for VHWs procured under MPTF project on Joined UN COVID-19 Response.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, it was proven. Village Health Workers were able to use developed digital platform for community activity reporting 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It was difficult to breakthrough into the health sector in Lesotho initially since UNDP is not primarily mandated to work on health issues. However, the Lab developed a prototype to prove the concept, ensuring that Bophelo-Ka-Mosebeletsi was developed collaboratively with relevant health experts knowledgeable in the health landscape. This strengthened building relations with relevant parties within Ministry of Health improving co-creation process for Bophelo-Ka-Mosebeletsi digital platform. The methodology worked well for this particular solution and the landscape, and nothing should be changed to the approach. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

18 Months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

$15000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

There is a planned stage to integrate BKM application with the Lehokela  (Community Security) application to share data and analytical insights to improve support to victim of violence and crime. Planned activity will be done in collaboration with UNICEF.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. The experiment is currently being scaled to expand it to more districts in addition to two pilot districts, with additional partnership support from a range of development partners. The experiment has also provided evidence  policy review for Ministry of Health on the following areas:

1. Including community health within e-health strategy

2. Review of VHWs Programme Policy to reduce age of engagement for VHWs to 65 maximum (from no limit initially). Additionally, education requirement section for engagement of VHWs was reviewed from no education required initially, to the minimum of Form-C (Grade-10).

3. Incorporation of all community health activities onto Bophelo-Ka-Mosebeletsi digital platform, which initially had COVID-19 module only.

4.Expansion of deployment area from two districts to five districts with resource support from UNICEF. Has further potential to expand due to support interest from other development partners including World Bank.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

  

Reflecting on the insights obtained from implementation of the Bophelo-Ka-Mosebeletsi (BKM) mobile application developed by the Lesotho Accelerator Lab in 2020 as a response to COVID-19, analysing pathways to scaling of experiments is necessary to obtain projected results bearing the foundation to support sustainable scaling of experiment. Based on the outlined learning questions, the experiment managed to achieve the insightful elements which are reflected within the following scaling dimensions:

a)     Scaling Up: “Which involves institutional and policy changes to further the innovation”

      ·     Incorporation of community health element within strategies - BKM provided evidence for possible use of digital technologies by VHWs, and the insights harvested from the two pilot districts of Mokhotlong and Quthing indicated high appreciation on the use of digital technologies by the VHWs. This highlighted the significance of community health data for incorporation into broader ministerial guides, encouraging a course of revision to existing e-Health Strategy (draft) to incorporate the community health elements with specifics to the VHWs unit activities within communities.

     ·    Revision of VHWs education and age requirements within Primary Healthcare Policy - To align with insights of the experiment, Ministry of Health revised the Primary Health Policy that governs implementation of Village Healthcare Workers unit. The policy strengthens aspects of VHWs programme management, the recruitment process with review on  the entry academic requirements of Village Healthcare Workers from “No Education requirement” to a minimum of “Grade-10 or Form-C”.  Other sections that were reviewed under the policy included the age requirement, reducing it to 65 from no age limit. Additionally,  the observation from rolling out the experiment was that some Village Healthcare Workers profiles did not suit the capacity to utilise digital technologies. E.g., Some Village Healthcare Workers were over the age of eighty (80), with no formal education and digital skills, while some had eyesight challenges due to elderly age.

    · Human resource management element of the policy – Since the Primary Healthcare Unit did not have proper documentation of Village Healthcare Workers, it was difficult to trace communities that had active and non-active Village Healthcare Workers. The Key Performance Indicators used to collect evidence on BKM digital platform ensured that Ministry of Health has evidence of day-to-day activities performed by Village Healthcare Workers, ensuring that stipends are paid to the right personnel, efficiently.

    · Development of new policy prospects – BKM experiment insights encouraged proposal to develop the Community Health Strategy and Policy. The proposal forms part of the scale-up in collaboration with UNICEF, where the ministry will endorse BKM as the ultimate Community Health Information System (CHIS) integrated into District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) to cover all community-based services. The new policy will come with controls to ensure that all development partners collaborate and utilise BKM as the unified community tool for data collection and analysis. Any development partner having resources geared towards digital support in the community will have to propose for review of the existing platform for possible upgrade to include new requirements after thorough analysis.  

           · Leveraging on Digital Public Goods Alliance as per the requirements of UNDP Digital Strategy – As the Lab scales BKM digital platform, sustainability, performance, and security play an integral role to ensure smooth implementation and improved user experience and acceptance. The application is currently under development to incorporate all community health activities and the new BKM digital platform is being developed over Open-Source Smart Register Platform (OpenSRP) stack.  OpenSRP is designed to support health systems delivering Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Health + Adolescent Health (RMNCH+) services with community-based outreach. OpenSRP is one of the solutions listed under Digital Public Goods Alliance that can be customised and used freely for human development and help acceleration of achievement of SDGs.

b)     Scaling Out: “Which includes achieving greater numbers through adoption of the innovation”

          ·   Increased number of Village Healthcare Workers using  BKM digital platform - There is a network of around 9,265, (VHW Verification report, 2020) Village Healthcare Workers in the country, inclusive of Supervisors and Coordinators.  From this number, UNDP enrolled and trained 682 VHWs on BKM from the Mokhotlong and Quthing districts. With collaboration with UNICEF, additional 800 VHWs will be trained and allocated gadgets from Maseru, Leribe and Mohale’s Hoek districts. Plans are underway in collaboration with World Bank to expand training of VHWs nationwide.

      ·     Increase in the number of healthcare facilities – The initial pilot stage of the application covered 11 healthcare facilities in two districts of Mokhotlong and Quthing. With the new rollout plan in collaboration with UNICEF and World Bank, this number will increase to include all 274 healthcare facilities within the country will be enrolled into BKM. From this, further training of 230 VHWs’ Coordinators from nine districts will be trained, with exclusion of VHWs from Maseru district already trained earlier in 2023. This training will be followed by national training of all 9,265 VHWs in the country, excluding the already trained VHWs Coordinators.

         ·   Increased number of functional modules incorporated into BKM digital platform – In the pilot phase, BKM ran a single COVID-19 Surveillance and Disease Control Module for data collection and analysis. The new platform will incorporate more than ten (11) functional modules including the  VHWs Programme Management module, VHW Household Register, Village Health Promotion Logbook, Community Health Register, Village Health Workers Registry, Under-Five Register, Maternal Health, VHW Stock Card Manager, Combined COVID-19 and TB Detection register, Nutrition and environmental Health, Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) for COVID-19 and other health related issues.

  ·      Increased partnership base to support BKM uptake - With sealed collaboration with UNICEF and World Bank, BKM is the pride of Lesotho  Accelerator Lab as the most successfully scaled experiment. The two organisations form additional collaborators to already existing partnerships outlined under preparation of environment for experiment scaling, and more partners are envisaged to collaborate once the policy to utilise BKM as the only  Community Health Information System is enacted.

c)     Scaling Deep: “Which is impacting culture through innovation that alters behaviours and norms, or a combination of all or some of the types of scaling”

       ·     Ownership, sustainability and building internal capacities –  The new software development exercise took into consideration; sustainability needs to ensure that technical level teams are well capacitate and own the solution. To achieve this, all Ministry of Health’s ICT staff were engaged  on the software development exercise of BKM digital platform, working with experienced developers from National University of Lesotho. The decision seeks to achieve  skills transfer to the Ministry’s technical personnel and will further improve  take-up of the solution, even to non-ICT units within the Ministry. The ministry has expressed the need to adopt this practice with a possibility of including  it within its guiding frameworks.

     ·   Enabling social interactive platforms to enhance VHWs digital skills – The controversial part of the experiment’s requirement was to enable VHWs to use social medial platforms and internet on the provided gadgets. While this was intolerable from the ministry’s side initially, the Lesotho Accelerator Lab believed that this aspect would help to improve VHWs’ digital skills set by exposing them to various and interesting digital platforms to diffuse technology intimidation. The ministry believed that uncontrolled use of the gadget will dilute outcomes of the objectives with substandard work from VHWs. With the average age of about 56 years for all VHWs trained in the first cohort in Quthing and Mokhotlong districts, and with careful consideration to only 10% of VHWs below 40 years, and a hefty 40% that was above age of 55 with no prior record of interacting with digital activity, opening the gadget for further frequent technology practice assisted in sharpening VHWs thinking and appreciation of technology use. While BKM took into consideration the need for human centered design approach to use colour themes denoting interface elements, other techniques were also used to influence digital inclusion to accelerate the solution’s user acceptance.

    ·   Financial Inclusion Sensitisation – While this was not the primary intent and the key objective of the experiment, KPIs were developed to  measure this dimension. VHWs were allowed to utilise Econet Telecom Lesotho’s provided  sim-cards for mobile money products such as Ecocash to transfer money and pay bills.  VHWs were also able to use Ecocash for community saving schemes as well on  Ecosure which is the mobile money insurance product. Over 35% of VHWs reported  to have been engaged in mobile money financial activities after a period of six  months from the training.

 



> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

After realising that it was possible for Village Health Worker to report using digital platform to address urgent needs of COVID-19 surveillance, the next step was to ensure that data collected is used efficiently to strengthen community health programming as a whole to review policies and to ensure that e-health strategy takes into consideration elements of community which were not deemed as important prior to the experiment. We did not even know that Village Health Workers were not being paid stipends because it was difficult to manage the programme and also to reflect their actual activities as evidence to enact payments, hence the Lab has learned that its important and easy to influence any model or structures when data is available, analysed clearly and well to inform organisational needs.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

1. Penetrating and working within the health sector was the main challenge is health is not primarily the UNDP's mandate. Ministry of Health in Lesotho boasts a number of development partners with large investments, and opening up for Accelerator Lab to experiment was not easy as is was perceived as some form of competition from unlikely competitor.

2. Lack of resources  - Initially, the Lab did not have any funding planned for COVID-19 response. The Lab utilised its inherent technical knowhow on software development to design and develop proof of concept to enable ensure ease of communication to beneficiaries and implementing partners. Concurrent to this exercise, the Lab was also in engagement with academia to have developers of board and telecommunications company to provide free network and internet access for Village Health Workers based on the knowledge that the application may not be used due to internet challenges.

3. Effects of COVID-19 - The pandemic contributed to dynamic changes to landscape, and the results of interrogating requirements today may change the following day. This was also the case in sealing partnerships.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All CO units will benefit from the experiment results, but not the actual outputs but soft lessons including our ability and strategies to mobilise partnerships and resources. For instance, from this experiment, we managed to seal long term partnerships from private sector and academia which we are replicating in many works of our work, including the work being done within different units.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Development partners including UNICEF, WHO, Partners for Health, World Bank etc. Currently UNICEF and World Bank are the main development partners involved in the experiment scaling process. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

1. Ensuring that the implementation landscape has attributes that are likely to those inherent in Lesotho. These may include the health programmes structures particularly those providing service to the community, mobile network infrastructure, ICT capacities in public health,  etc.
2. Ensure that there is a political will within health sector from both the technical and strategic levels.
3. Have a pool of external partnerships to ensure sustainability of the solution even beyond experimental period.
4. Be open to stakeholders inputs and ensure that those relevant and improving the experiment incorporated.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes.

1. Agriculture - collecting real-time data on smallholder farmers in communities feeding into analytics platform to monitor animal health, feed requirements, or maybe also measuring effects of climate change on agricultural activities. Insights from use of technology can be used to inform strategic visioning within the agricultural sector.

2. Governance and promotion of social cohesion in communities. E.g. Local government structures and community policing. Collecting data on social and governance activities at community level can help to develop models for social cohesion and livelihoods, with possibilities of leveraging on the indigenous knowledge for greater reception. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Establishment of key partners to support the experiment and the project beyond are iconic to the Ministry of Health as the implementing partner also the beneficiary. Sensemaking  that was done was mainly to achieve big tickets in partnering with private sector which the Ministry highlighted as very important because it would not be the case if it was not for UNDP. Since the health sector was a tough environment for UNDP to work on, I believe that the team performed well and there is nothing we could have done differently.

> What surprised you?

Obtaining the three scaling dimensions are a major surprise since the objective was not to influence so many aspects with community healthcare all at the same time. Additionally,  having World Bank within the scaling process as this was one of the toughest and also influential partnerships which made implementation of the experiment a bit difficult at the beginning.
