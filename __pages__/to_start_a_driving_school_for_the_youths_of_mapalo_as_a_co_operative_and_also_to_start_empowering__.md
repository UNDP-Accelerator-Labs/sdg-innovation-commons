> Brief description of the innovation

We want to form a Driving school that will help the people in our locality because most of the young people depend on this type of empowerment as a means of survival because most of the young people and adults alike have not managed to complete their education hence this will become as a way of helping them to achieve their dreams. In the training program we have also included basic car maintenance to enhance their skills of taking care of their vehicles. we shall also need to have two by thirty two seater mini buses for the co-operative for income generation. Basic car maintenance will not be limited to young people alone but also to anyone who will need our services as this type of a service is not taught in many driving schools. Through our Plan we will empower the first five young people with cars which they need to work for and after paying the agreed amount then those cars will be given to them as theirs and More cars will be bought and given to the next group in our co-operative. So this will be a continuous program.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate income in the following ways; 
- Through the affordable fees that will charged to the learners who want to become drivers.
- Through those who will be trained in Basic car maintenance as this is never taught in other driving schools.
- Through the interest that will be charged on those that will be empowered with cars.
- Through the two by thirty seater mini buses which will be owned by the co-operative.
Our target group will be the young people as most of them did not have a chance of completing their education due to circumstances beyond their control who will find this as a means of empowering them. Not only to young people from our locality but also from other areas as well. Because we will be dealing with this target group our fees will be affordable and competitive.

> Technical Feasibility

Our proposed implementation plan will be immediately we receive the funds we will register our driving school and buy all the necessities or requirement for us to start the the business. The training ground is already available, Instructors have already been contacted. So we will jus be waiting for funding so that our program can start

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will improve the the live of others through the following ways;
- Empowering the young people through the provision of cars that will be given to them as loans.
- Through the provision of training of drivers who will obtain the licenses.
- Through training of the people in Basic car maintenance.
Our innovation is very relevant because most people or young people who did not have chance to complete school due circumstances beyond their control opt to be trained as drivers so that they can start fending for themselves.
