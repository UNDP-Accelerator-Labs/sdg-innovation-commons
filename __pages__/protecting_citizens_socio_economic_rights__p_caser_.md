> Title of the innovation

Protecting Citizens Socio-Economic Rights (P-CASER)

> Brief description of the innovation

A Social Security Application to generate personal information on citizens living conditions so as to develop a certain level of understanding of individual households and be able to properly evaluate financial capacity, health conditions, housing and location, education background and access to essential services such as good health facilities,  and quality education, as well as assess food security.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This is a lifetime investment because it's not just a personal project but a project that can enhance government operations and goals provided the government of Zambia buys into this project.  This Application will offer job opportunities for many, especially the youth because this system will not manage itself. It would need Analysts, Data Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, Social Workers, Psychologists, Field Workers, etc. and definitely constant updates to improve and refine the system. The target group is every citizen of the Republic of Zambia. However, to start of, pilot study of citizens in Kitwe District on the Copperbelt Province. The Grant will help in the development of the P-CASER Application and pave way to the pilot study which will provide evidence and results that can be presented to government for national implementation. It will improve the socio-economic outlook of the District through evidence-based information that will be used to implement strategic decisions/policies for the betterment of the well-being of the citizens.

> Technical Feasibility

Unfortunately, no prototype is in existence at the moment.  However, for a start, it will be a mobile Application that will be easily accessible on all Android, Windows or Apple operated phone.  Will work with iStore, Microsoft Store, Play Store and all mobile service providers.

Proposed implementation plan: Jan 2022-March 2022 Development of P-CASER Application 

April 2022-June 2022 Implementation of Trial Run on P-CASER Application Prototype

July 2022-Sept 2022 Analysis of Data Collected

Oct 2022-Nov 2022 Evaluation of P-CASER Application

Dec 2022 Presentation of Findings

> Anticipated Social Impact

The purpose of this innovation is to improve on the acquisition of relevant information to aid in the development of appropriate systems for the equitable distribution of social services. For instance, the current selection criteria of those that qualify for social cash transfer is blurred and as such accessibility, monitoring and evaluation of the scheme remains a huge challenge marred with accountability problems. This Application will foster for effective checks and balances to the system. In addition, this Application will offer value addition to social welfare services that Zambia provides providing an increased and improved evidence-based system. This Application will also pave way for an improved health service which will extend beyond hospital infrastructure. Home-based care in this case would increase and be improved upon. Emergency services would improve thereby contribute to lower mortality rates of BIDs because even as EMTs rush to the aid of an individual, health history of the individual would have been known prior to their arrival and attending to the person and appropriate medical procedure would be applied there and then pending further examination at the hospital.  In addition, the donor service would also improve because health needs would be at every citizens door step thereby increasing participation.  It would also aid in identifying gaps in social services and improve on areas with deficiencies, e.g. Specialist Doctors, Medical Diagnostic Equipment and right medicines, etc. Most importantly, there would be a reconciled and consistent record of statistics in the country be it health, education, housing or income levels all the way to the nitty gritty details of the number of people afflicted by a particular health condition or are lacking in meeting their everyday needs, which will aid in the advancement of an appropriate approach to institute a measure to address particular problems.
