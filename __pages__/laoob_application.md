## The Problem:

1- Lack of Proper Coaching and Equipment: Many aspiring amateur football players in Iraq lack access to proper coaching and basic equipment. This deficiency in resources hinders their development and growth in the sport.

2- Limited Financial Support: Financial support for amateur players is limited, making it difficult for them to afford necessary training, equipment, and participation in competitive events.  

3- Media Visibility and Recognition: The lack of media attention and spotlight on amateur players in local teams prevents their talent from being recognized and acknowledged. This lack of visibility impacts their chances for growth and potential professional opportunities.  

4- Disconnect with Talent Scouts: There is a significant disconnect between amateur football players and talent scouts. This communication gap, compounded by the absence of effective channels like social media, irregular competitive events, and potential inequalities, prevents talented players from being discovered and nurtured.

5- Infrastructure Challenges: While playgrounds are available in most Iraqi cities, challenges exist in securing access. High demand, lack of proper scheduling systems, difficulties in reaching playground owners, and inconsistent maintenance can hinder players' ability to use these facilities effectively.

6- Self-Funding and Playground Reservations: Local teams in Iraq are often self-funded and must pay to reserve playgrounds for matches. The process of reserving preferred time slots, accessing owners, and dealing with inconsistent maintenance can be cumbersome and impact team activities.  

7- Unregistered Amateur Players: A significant number of amateur football players in Iraq (more than one million) are not registered with the Iraqi Football Association. This lack of formal registration can limit their opportunities for organized play and recognition.  

8- Uneven Quality of Facilities: While playgrounds are available, the quality of these facilities can vary across different districts, affecting the overall playing experience and skill development of players.  

9- Inequality and Corruption: There is a potential for inequality and corruption that may prevent talented players from being recognized, further exacerbating the challenges of talent development and growth. 

10- Competitive Opportunities: The irregularity of competitive events organized by talent scouts/clubs can limit players' chances to showcase their skills and potential for professional football.
