> Title of the innovation

Solar energy, an alternative for power shortages

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is an idea that is to help reduce on dependency on our traditional electrical energy sources such as hydroelectric and fossil fuels but one that rather focuses on the things that we can implement in order to start promoting solar energy which may be a good source of electricity in areas where the grid has not yet been established. It provides ways in which we can promote solar energy to in order to reduce over dependency on our current electrical energy sources as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It also shows how jobs can be created through that project especially for jobless youths and also encourage research in our academic facilities. It also promotes an advancement in science and technology for the country and also improving the lives of stakeholders involved in the area of photovoltaics by providing them jobs through the project.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If my project idea could be put into action by funding it, first and foremost, people would have to be employed to gather statistical information to be used for research, and also jobs for those to be involved in the installation process of solar panel systems once the project is well established and proved to be beneficial. Solar energy would give access to electricity in areas where grid electricity is not available, and in turn, electricity brings enhancement in all circles of life from educations good access to information through television and electronic gadgets. The potential beneficiaries are the members of communities without grid electricity. The government would also benefit as there would be minimized electricity shortages due to a reduction on traditional electricity generation types. The value addition of such an idealistic project is that global warming would be reduced by a certain fraction due to reduced dependency on fossil fuels.

> Technical Feasibility

The plan of this project mainly involves the largest utility company in our country, zesco to be implemented. The plan is that zesco should engage in purchasing wholesale stock of various components required to establish solar systems then sold to people in the community with offers to provide installation services at a cheaper than usual charge just to promote solar energy. Mainly, the installation cost of solar systems is usually high and many people have not done the homework of finding the long run advantages of this and so they are hesitant on going for solar energy. The fact that sensitisation is one important process to teach people about the advantages of solar energy already is a job creating venture. I for one believes that with many professionals from economists, engineers, statisticians working together in this project, costly though it may seem, the long run benefits would be appreciated. American and china are already working hard to go solar, that shows that solar can be a reliable alternative source of energy amidst global warming.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Over 40 percent of our people may not have electricity and the grid system may be far from ever reaching them. Wouldn't it be a good thing for them to use solar instead? Where electricity is, people get connected. It improves access to information and promotes businesses.
