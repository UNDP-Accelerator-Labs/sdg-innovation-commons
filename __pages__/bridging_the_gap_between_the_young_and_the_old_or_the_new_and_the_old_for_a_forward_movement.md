Bridging the gap between the young and the old or the new and the old for a forward movement

> Brief description of the innovation

For every forward movement in life it requires new way of thinking and new perspectives in front of us.But then we must understand were we are to learn wisdom of the old in both our mistakes/failures and success achieved in order to build on and move forward.We must know that the future is bright when we consider that past lessons are not irrelevant.To have right guide in life makes one avoid many mistakes,hence the need to bridge up the old and the young

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This is a mindset make achievers go getters pioneers and history maker.Success is a mindset and having such thoughts will position us to shape our destinies aright such that the genetation yet unborn will have a hope and a future.What we learn now both our mistakes and success will be an advantage to the next generation.I believe that once these thoughts are put inprint they will be commercially viable and development is innevitable.

> Technical Feasibility

I intend to reach as many people as possible and more especially the young generation because the future is ours for the taking.I have platforms in homes churches and the media,therefore this undertaking to me is a success.Am also looking on market penetration and as at now strategising.In the near future i look forward to reach the education system at all levels.

> Anticipated Social Impact
