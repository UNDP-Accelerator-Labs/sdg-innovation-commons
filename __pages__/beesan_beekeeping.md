An experience that allows you to live as a beekeeper in the heart of Jerash, and learn honey production from a local family who has inherited the honey industry from their forefathers.

The family also offers traditional meals from breakfast and lunch. After breakfast in the backyard, a hiking trip is available to the apiary location. You will gear up with the special beekeeper suit and begin the bee experience there.
