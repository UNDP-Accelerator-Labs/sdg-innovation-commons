> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

There are lots of villages in the world that are still not electrified or are receiving power erratically. Given the limited global supply of fossil fuels, the search for renewable energy has been on the top of the sustainability agenda. Biomass gasification, a century-old technology, is viewed today as an alternative to conventional fuel. In the gasification process, wood, charcoal, and other biomass materials are gasified to produce so-called producer gas for power or electricity generation. Mr. Rai Singh Dahiya observed that the users of biomass gas (producer gas) as a fuel generally complain about choking in the engine after running for a certain period. He solved this problem. The innovator has changed the conventional design of gasifiers, especially the filters and cooling units to get clean gas and ensure smooth operation of the engine at low operational cost. It is a downdraft type bio- mass gasifier, a compact and efficient system for converting BioMass into producer gas which is used as a fuel in running Diesel Engine by making little modification to the engine. The Biomass is burnt in a furnace packed from all the sides and has one outlet to pass the gases to another chamber where these gases are cooled and then passed through the filter for filtration. This filtered gas is then fed to the engine, as a substitute for diesel or like other fuel, for its running. 

1. Compact, mobile, and a soundproof unit 

2. Extremely clean gas generated from the gasifier, making downstream cleaning systems simple. 

3. It converts the agricultural waste into the generation of the electrical power 

4. No need for continuous flow of water, easy to operate, no extra training or skill is required 

5. Reliable &amp; rugged system, stand-alone mobile system, can be used anywhere where we need power. 

6. All types of wood waste and fuelwood Stalks of cotton, pulses, coconut shells, coconut palm stalks, Maize cobs, Rice husk, Branches &amp; twinges, briquettes of various agricultural residues, Certain Industrial wastes of paper mills, plywood industry, etc can be used as a fuel. 

7. The fuel consumption is reported to be 1 kg/kVA, claimed to be almost 30-35 percent lesser than conventional gasifiers, and depending upon the feedstock it produces ash and charcoal (7-10%) as a by-product.
