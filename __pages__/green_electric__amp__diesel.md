> Title of the innovation

Green Electric &amp; Diesel

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation shall allow us to produce electricity and diesel from garbage and other bio-degradable waste  products. We plan to collect discarded food waste from markets, restaurants, super markets, etc. These shall include but not limited  to, tomatoes, cabbages, nshima, paper, etc. We also plan to collect or buy manure from farms, dwellings, etc. Additionally, we also plan to collect wood waste such as saw dust, wood chips and shavings, etc. from carpenters, markets  and other production facilities.

These waste products shall then be transported to our plants for processing into bio-gas, natural gas(with further cleaning), bio-diesel(with further processing) and high grade fertilizer(manure) as a by products. These products shall then be used in various applications as shall be explained below in the next section.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The products from the process shall be used as follows:

1.  The Bio-gas shall be used as follows:
i) Sold to locals for cooking and heating needs as a cheaper and cleaner source of  fuel in comparison to the usual source  of charcoal. The later causes deforestation and contributed to global warming and climate change, which is one of the factors we shall counter.
ii) It  shall be used as fuel  for gasoline generators(no modifications needed) to produce electricity(either by private users we have supplied or by us). This electricity shall then be sold either directly to consumers(if produced by us) OR sold to the Electricity Utility Company - ZESCO(again if produced by us).

2. Natural gas, shall be used as explained in clause 1.) above for Bio-gas.

3. Bio-diesel shall be used as follows:
i) As fuel for trucks and vans which shall be in the collection of garbage and waste products for our plants in order to drastically reduce transportation costs in the running of our business.
ii) Shall be sold to consumers in need of a cheaper and cleaner source of diesel for their vehicles. The main target shall be transporters.
iii) It  shall be used as fuel  for diesel generators(no modifications needed) to produce electricity(either by private users we have supplied or by us). This electricity shall then be sold either directly to consumers(if produced by us) OR sold to the Electricity Utility Company - ZESCO(again if produced by us).
4.  The by-products:
i)Heat shall be used to heat the bio-digester tanks to the required temperature for anaerobic reactions to take place. The heats shall also be used for general heating required throughout the plant and also sold to nearby industries and homes which might require heating.
ii) The high grade fertilizer(manure) shall be sold to the agriculture market for use in their crop nutrition requirements.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation shall be built using locally available materials. These shall require the  use of concrete and steel in the construction of the mixing tank, bio-digester( there will be three stages  of bio-digesters to maximize collection of bio-gas from the same substrate and shall each have a dome for the collection of bio-gas at the top), a slurry tank(for the collection of used substrate which shall then be used as high grade fertilizer(manure).

Completion of a basic plant producing 5MW of power(able to power 10,000 homes) with all the funding in place shall be completed in 60 days. Additionally, we shall need to purchase high pressure large steel storage tanks for final  storage of all produces gas. These shall be imported and shall arrive within six weeks of purchase from China.  There is also a need to purchase smaller steel pressure container for resale or rent to consumers. We shall also require to purchase one 30 ton tipper(new or used) to be used in collection of garbage and bio-waste.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation shall  impact lives of others in several different ways. For starters, we shall reduce the bio footprint required in production of energy and electricity in the country. This shall be done through excess reduction of deforestation and collection of garbage which could have otherwise been rotting in public places, producing bad smells and also methane, which has a factor four times higher than carbon monoxide in adding to global warming.

Consumers shall be provided with cheaper and cleaner energy to be used as they need or want. It shall also benefit farmers as we shall buy manure from them and supply them with high grade organic fertilizer or a swap agreement can be arranged.

Furthermore, it will provide  employment for several women, youths and the differently abled who shall have varying roles in the production chain as labourers, drivers, technical support, engineers, etc.
