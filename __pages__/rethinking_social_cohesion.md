Portfolio approach to Transform through social cohesion in Panama 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



After a series of activities, including extensive interviews, media sensing and an interactive community walk (Jane Walk), we’ve identified, and our challenge is, that in Panama there is an erosion of trust in people, trust in institutions, and trust in tomorrow - we’ve summarized this as a breakdown in social cohesion.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



 Panama has seen unprecedented demonstrations in recent weeks, garnering attention from international media outlets, a most recent one from the Washington Post: “Panama has erupted in deadly protests over copper mining,” while protesters hold up signs that read “Panama is not for sale.”  Historians liken the situation to the 1980’s – when Panama witnessed widespread civil unrest as citizens tried to reclaim sovereignty over the US occupied Canal Zone territory.  

Panama is the third country with the highest inequality in the region.  

Given Panama’s level of development, financial inclusion is lower than expected.  Water shortages are frequent.  Support for democracy is in decline.

When asked, what is one thing you would do to change Panama´s current outlook, we often heard, as one interviewee bluntly proposed: “I’d change all politicians.” Yet, when asked who is responsible for the change we want to see, the response was often, “politicians.” The relationships we have with people, our institutions, and our surroundings is fractured.  

We also identified a lack of hope, disconnected public policies, and a sense that government is “useless,” a growing digital divide, rising inflation, a sense of ‘every man for himself.’  These trends are becoming tangible with visible signs in daily life, and bubbling to the surface, as we witnessed recently.  

In this context, another conversation resonates: "We lack a common national goal that unites society towards a shared vision. Before, the goal was to get back the Panama Canal, but now that this has been achieved, there is nothing that unifies the country under one single direction."  Much like the portfolio process, the need for a unifying vision becomes even more apparent, considering the underlying issues that remain obscured beneath the surface. 

This highlights the complex and challenging dynamic in the quest for societal transformation.

> 

Based on the research carried out by Latinobarometer earlier in 2023, Panama falls within the category of countries where satisfaction with democracy is below 20%.  

There is a fragile relationship between people and government: a resounding 80% of Panamanians perceive people as untrustworthy.  In 2019, UNDP’s National Human Development Report sternly advocated for strengthening institutions. Almost four years later, distrust remains high.

Growing insecurity is leading to polarization, distrust and feelings of lack of control over one’s own life. Globally, less than 30% of people think that most people can be trusted, this being the lowest value recorded.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Weak signals that have been identified can be grouped in the following areas: distrust in institutions, declining support for democracy, rising inequality, and insecurity and increasing polarization. The following signals collected represent these thematic areas:

80.9% of Panamanians think that people in Panama are 'little to no trustworthy.' (Encuesta revela 'hiperdesconfianza' entre los panameños (laestrella.com.pa) ↗)

75% of Panamanians supported the democratic system in 1996; in 2020, the support to democracy has declined to 35%, based on statistics from the Latinobarometro (2020) (Construcción de confianza pública, el camino hacia el desarrollo (laestrella.com.pa) ↗)

Distrust and disaffection for the commons increases as inequality grows.

Trust is the most urgent problem that Latin America and the Caribbean is facing, and yet the least debated.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



UNDP and the Global Innovation Unit have sought out the UNDP Accelerator Labs to push the Strategic Plan 2022-2025 to catalyze the deep systemic transformations needed to solve our most pressing development challenges. 

Our Lab was tasked with supporting the shift from projects to portfolios due to its alignment with the need for a more agile, innovative, and adaptive approach to development. 

Our Lab’s UVP is its unconventional approach to understand deep rooted systemic issues - thus far, for example, involving the CO in a signal mapping exercise by conducting a Jane Walk - a community walking tour that aims to discuss various aspects of a neighborhood or city, such as architecture, urban design, social dynamics and local history.  It is a way for people to come together, observe, and discuss their surroundings, fostering a deeper understanding of the build environment.  Activities such as these had never been done before at UNDP Panama.  

Our Lab needs to be working on these issues because we’re open to exploring new methods, and we are intentional about bringing the CO into the fold.  When we hear CO colleagues start using new terminology and referencing new methods, we know it’s working.

We need to continuously invest in these unconventional approaches because, while conducting these exercises, we realize that we are not solving challenges through conventional methods and continuously receive feedback such as: “we should do this more often.”  They shed new light on problems that have been looked at for decades with little progress.  The CO is also open to adopting new approaches when given time and attention.  The Lab has been instrumental in leading.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Can UNDP Panama go beyond the tradition structure and practice of a project-based approach to drive transformational change under a portfolio of social cohesion.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



 Sensemaking is a muscle for dynamically managing the portfolio, extracting learning and adapting as we go.  The practice is adapted for more frequent check-ins (to track learning and emerging insights) and less frequent strategic touchpoints (meant to take stock of the overall direction of the efforts). 

 To test coherence of our existing work in relation to the strategic intent and external changes, we intend to use collective intelligence, participatory design and systems thinking to extract intelligence that can feed intentional shaping of the portfolio by looking at the following questions:

‣Where the patterns and synergies (of insights, learnings) across existing interventions that if connected would lead to new interventions and acceleration of results on the ground?  

‣ What assets (relationships, expertise, insights, roles we play) exist in the current portfolio that if we’re more intentional about leveraging can accelerate the results on the ground?  

‣ Where do we have gaps that require seeding new partnerships, capabilities, etc? 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The iterative nature of the continous feedback allows us to design and adjust the portfolio process with agility, the continous feedback is not just internal, but the in-depth interviews also allow us to take the pulse of what we are learning, map signals of change and adapting our process as we go. In addition, through the bootcamps we have spaces to validate not just with external partners, but internal partners what we are learning and how we seek to transform through this portfolio process. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



  

Shared learning is a key goal of systems thinking and is fundamental to the UNDP portfolio's implementation alongside our partners. This approach, while new to UNDP Panama, holds immense potential to significantly impact how we address systemic issues. It encourages collaboration over working in isolation, linking diverse agendas and missions for a cohesive strategy. 

Moreover, this initiative is already reshaping our office culture. We're moving away from viewing projects in isolation, driven by a growing curiosity among colleagues to understand ongoing work and explore deeper collaboration. This shift is leading us toward a more dynamic, interconnected project framework that not only enhances collective efficacy but also accelerates sustainable development progress.

Other key beneficiaries, and champions, who have already started to benefit from our portfolio and who we will continue to engage with include:

Local Governments and Municipalities: We have already engaged with local municipalities - their involvement can help tailor interventions to specific community needs and ensure that local insights and challenges are considered. This can also facilitate the scaling of successful projects within different municipalities.

Civil Society Organizations (CSOs): Due to their deep community ties, we see them as crucial mediators between the UNDP and local communities, helping to build trust and ensure community needs are met.

Business Community: Engaging the private sector can provide additional resources, innovation, and investment necessary for scaling successful initiatives. 

We want to make a more intentional effort to work with the following actors, as we are seeing increasing relevance:

Ministry of Social Development: As the body responsible for implementing social policies, collaborating with the Ministry can ensure that the strategies developed are aligned with national priorities and have the necessary governmental backing. Their involvement can help scale successful interventions across different regions of Panama.

Media Outlets: Building relationships with the media can help raise awareness about the efforts and successes of the portfolio approach, garnering public support and accountability. We believe they can also play an educational role, helping to shift public perception and increase engagement.
