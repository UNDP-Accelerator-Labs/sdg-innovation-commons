According to Moroccan Central Bank, 88% of the people go for informal ways such as Daret when it comes to funding. while being pointed at as an unsafe funding system that further pushes out the economically disadvantaged into informal finance, this very popular way of lending and saving seems to outlive and outgrow every other existing modern finance service for the low and middle classes.
Here is how it usually goes. Every person, predominantly a group of woman, makes a monthly contribution. For instance, for a group of 10 women where every woman gives 500 MAD. the group assign the total, in this case 5000 MAD to one of them because of her pressing needs at the time. and the others will have each a turn and everyone keep systematically contributing the same amount. Where things are interesting is while every one have some skin in the game, the money allocating decision making is consensual and works just fine proving how trust can be enough to oil the informal finance machine.
