I met an incredible metal genius who succeeded in following all the laws of aerodynamics by building a model helicopter from a visualization. 
In Guinea and particularly in Kamsar, there is a man by the name of Yéro Kanté, never educated but who has to his credit creations worthy of an engineer of great schools. Yéro by viewing a helicopter, will bring together all the equipment necessary to make this dream come true. Beyond the physical design, he will meet pilots who will not hesitate to provide him with everything he needs to learn, understand and master all the interdependencies linked to the dynamics of the helicopter. This is how yéro will put everything on its side, with the support of a team of young people guided by the strong desire to see the dream come true; to collect metals, weld them together, make a rotor and hand-crafted propellers and finally buy a motor which will serve to provide a driving power drive to the whole. After days of hard work, Yéro will be congratulated by his friends and almost all the inhabitants for his achievement
