## 

Ecuador does not have a municipal recycling program. Separated waste goes all in one truck and sent to the dump where some waste pickers separate waste in bad work conditions. Other waste pickers walk around neighborhoods in early hours to look into trash bags and bins separating waste products. Reciveci is a crowdsourcing app where citizens can map local waste pickers, geolocalize them in a city map with their contact information so other citizens can reach them and agree on specific days to collect their recycling materials. The app improves their work conditions as they receive materials separated and clean. It has increased their livelihoods. Ecuador AccLab has held 9 experiments with ReciVeci App, by using behavioral insights methodology to see behavioural change with specific requests, incentives, communicational information. A citizen initiative and Ecuador AccLab partner.
