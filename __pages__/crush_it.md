CRUSH-IT is a machine designed to crush recyclable items like plastic bottles and aluminium tins. Users can use the machine's touchscreen display to choose the type of item that needs to be crushed. When the plastic bottle or aluminium tin is crushed, a mechanical presser in the machine will flatten the item for storage inside the machine. This is a more economic method because it involves lower travelling distance and transportation costs to collect recyclable waste. This technique can also minimise carbon emissions from the waste. 
Operating based on Internet of Things (IoT), the Crush-It machine not only detects the total collection but can also send notifications to the collector to inform that the machine is full. A text message will be sent with the phrase 'TONG PENUH' (translated as 'full bin'). The user can also access data and download the data into a USB drive. 
One additional feature is that there is a dump bin prepared on the side of the machine to enable users to insert bottle caps and collecting rack to hold plastic cups and used cup covers. The machine also comes with a panel display for commercial advertisement purposes.
