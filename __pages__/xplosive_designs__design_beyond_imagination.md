> Brief description of the innovation

The idea is to open a light factory for making egg trays, cups and plates made from recycled paper and cardboards, 
It's easy to find the raw materials in Zambia which is paper and cardboard, we can approach companies and malls to start collecting from there dumping sites thus helps them to manage waste.

Our target customers for these products are farmers also food and beverage companies.
   by making a good business partnership with the customers on delivery, efficiency in the production line and giving them at a lower price compared to other manufacturers in existence.   
   This idea needs good marketing and communications system also people who are serious to have a job,

> Technical Feasibility

For this to work their is need to have land and the production line machines also water and electricity as well as paper not forget man power.
  There are experts who know how to install all the machines needed for the production line, and are there to advice on every aspect of this production. The attached photos and videos can explain well how this works.

> Anticipated Social Impact

If given this opportunity, this will create jobs for youths who are not employed and will uplift their living standards and also it will be a huge contribution to the country.
