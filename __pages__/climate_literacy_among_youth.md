## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Improving climate literacy among children through systems thinking and simulation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The climate crisis is one of the biggest threats we face globally, yet young people have little understanding and opportunities for discussion on the subject as part of their formal education. The environmental curriculum in Turkey briefly mentions climate change without going into detail on the real causes, effects, and potential solutions. This leaves students with limited understanding and no prospect of becoming a changemaker in the future.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Although the climate crisis is a real threat which every individual should be aware of, this issue has been neglected in the Turkish education system. Private schools have done more on the subject compared to public schools. The undesired effects of the said neglect include lack of awareness on the scale of the problem and consequently lack of action on every level, especially individual. Children do not feel empowered and remain passive participants in society.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

There is currently no official quantitative data source on this issue. However, our interactions with various education specialists have led us believe that the scale of the problem is indeed large and needs an urgent intervention.


</div>


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The interviews we conducted with education specialists and academics have shown that climate change is not a part of the official curriculum, therefore children’s understanding of the subject is rather limited even in educated families. There are a few academic papers that highlight this issue as well.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The CCE portfolio of the CO, though doing valuable work in the area of climate, has not delivered carefully curated educational content to young people which poses a major gap. UNICEF in Turkey has not done anything like that either. The AccLab is currently trying to address this issue by partnering with two institutions (Darussafaka School and Systems Thinking Association) that specialize in providing environmental education through systems thinking and simulation. We think these two innovative techniques could accelerate learning as they provide an interesting way to deliver dense content. The two institutions are among the winners of the 2021 UNDP Turkey AccLab Social Innovation Challenge.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Turkey’s first climate literacy programme using systems thinking & simulation is being tested with 13-year olds. The intervention aims to try new methods to see whether they will increase children’s understanding of and motivation to address climate-related issues.
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.

<div class="group">


> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Darussafaka School will host the experiment. Darrussafaka Association is the first non-governmental organization in Turkish history in the field of education with the mission of providing “equity in education.” Bright and talented children who have lost one of their parents and who have limited financial resources become eligible to study at Darussafaka after passing a competitive exam when they are ten years old, and Darussafaka provides them access to quality education at international standards. Today, at Darussafaka, 954 children from 68 different provinces of the country receive boarding co-education in English with a full scholarship from the 5th grade until high school graduation.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

This NGO will provide the necessary training on systems thinking and simulation. They aim to solve problems in the field of climate change, providing people with an information environment where they can understand the system in general and a simulation environment where they can take a decision-making position in policy development. System thinking, which is used as a methodology, aims to concretize how the relations between concepts work by students by using accessible and accessible tools for all ages in science and mathematics lessons.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Through incorporating systems thinking and simulation into environmental education, could we improve children's climate literacy and increase their ability to act on the issue?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The learning question requires testing of a simulation game and systems thinking methodology in climate education. The programme is co-created with partners and will be piloted at Darussafaka School.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Since quantitative data on children’s understanding of climate-related phenomena is rather limited, the pre- and post-intervention data we will collect through this experiment will set a good example. Specifically, the data (both quantitative and qualitative) collected during this experiment will show the impact of systems thinking and simulation in terms of changing attitudes of children towards the climate crisis. Surveys and interviews with children will be held. We will also rely on observation during the programme.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Schools and other places where children learn (e.g. youth centres, etc.) can benefit from the programme which will be developed for this challenge. In addition, teachers associations could take part in addressing this challenge. Ultimately, if the intervention is successful, we would like to pursue a scaling strategy in partnership with the Ministry of Education.
