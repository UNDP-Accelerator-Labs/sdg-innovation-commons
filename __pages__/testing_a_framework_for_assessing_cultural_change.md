Knowledge management



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to base decisions and behaviors on existing knowledge



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

- United Nations agency
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

United Nations Volunteers (UNV); Centro de Voluntariado Guatemalteco (CVG)


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if the proposed framework for assessing cultural change can help provide actionable insights when evaluating an activity. Among our assumptions we believed that conversations are a more appropriate way to generate insights than filling out forms, that semi-structured interviews are quick to set up and implement, and that we need to give room for unexpected learnings.  



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we use the proposed framework for assessing cultural change, THEN we will gain valuable and actionable insights that allow ways to improve the activity, report/capitalize results, and shared lessons. 



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Among the alternative evaluation frameworks, we chose the one that focused on cultural change. We created a prototype of the framework to pilot it on a completed activity. The activity we tested with the framework was a series of training workshops conducted with volunteer organizations. We hacked the framework by turning it into a semi-structure questionnaire to collect data through interviews. Conversation offered an easy way to engage a variety of stakeholders including participants, organizers, and external observants. We went ahead, designed the questionnaire, set up and implemented the interviews, transfer responses to a Mural, analyze the patterns to develop insights.  



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each person interviewed with the framework



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Semi-structured interviews 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One week



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

We needed access to Mural and Office tools. Time to conduct the interviews. Access to online platform to conduct the interviews. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partially proven.



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The framework seems to be biased towards focusing on positive outcomes. It's not clear that we are able to contrast the insights that are made possible using this framework compared to alternatives. We were able to implement the framework ourselves, but if we wanted to scale it, it's important to train interviewers. We only did one-on-one interviews, but it's possible to interview groups. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than a month



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00 additional costs. 



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This activity was conducted in different locations, so we would expect an analysis of the insights from each iteration. We are looking into including approaches from this framework (using interviews) to evaluate new activities. 



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We will be evaluating more activities with this approach to understand cultural change. 



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment did not scale yet
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We see that some types of cultural change, at least at the individual level, may be attainable with a small activity. The language people use to describe an activity, and the adoption of language seems to be one of the entry points to cultural change. Open conversations are more conductive to generating insights. Activities need to record unintended learnings. 



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

We don't necessarily see if this framework can replace others, but rather it's complimentary. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The whole Country Office can benefit from evaluating cultural change. 



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Counterparts in civil society who are often seeking to impact cultural changes, as well as government organizations. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We did three iterations. In the process we combined some items in the framework because the difference was not evident to people interviewed. For example: people can only speak for themselves when asked about how thinking about a topic has changed. Also, people cannot untangle the difference of what it means a change in: attitude, behavior, ability, or discourse. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Provide space for open and honest conversation during the interviews. Notice key information to ask to follow up questions and examples. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely, cultural change is needed to achieve results in all SDG's. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This activity was led by the global team, so it was mostly an experiment detached from the learning cycle. 



> What surprised you?

Some cultural changes (in language) can happen quickly. People can observe them, but not necessarily understand why.
