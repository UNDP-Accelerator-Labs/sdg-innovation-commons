## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Career counseling and Guidance 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

To craft a career counseling program to understand the ecosystem which could inform school children/out of school children /job seekers in terms of diversifying their career pathways. This is in anticipation to influence high preference of youth for public sector jobs and showcase alternate success pathway for youths. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Mentorship was one of the needs expressed by youths during “systems approach to youth unemployment” report socialization. The high youth unemployment rate in the country drove the whole systems and portfolio approach.  Now we are trying to experiment some of the proposed solutions and also understand the portfolio approach.      The Information and Career Guidance Unit under Ministry of Labour and Human Resources is leading the initiative with UNDP. Within UNDP, career and counseling program is part of the joint workplan between Governance, Economist and Accelerator Lab. This is an effort towards integrating innovation in CO.    From a rapid assessment in 2021 involving around 30 youths, children and youths, it was observed that these individuals sought support from their immediate network in matters related to relations, career, family issues, study and others. Friends, parents, elder siblings, close relatives, and teachers usually formed their guidance group. Many of respondent felt comfortable talking to their friends. At times, parents’ and relatives’ incomplete information and knowledge on job market limited children's' career choices. It is also observed that many of the children/youth at rural areas came from broken family.            Undesired situation: The Policy makers may not like and acknowledge some of the findings. Career and counselling may be looked at as a separate program. Career counseling in true sense must be integrated in the job search process and also during the formative age.

There is limited success narrative in Bhutan. You are successful if you have a desk job. Children and young people in Bhutan are faced with unprecedented challenge in job market, more so due to the COVID times. Individuals are loosing job, skills are become irrelevant and schools moved to virtual mode due to lockdowns.     Insights shared by Youths during rapid assessment.    “I wish somebody would help me with the beautician training opportunity” “I wish to get more guidance on types of jobs were available in the market” “I which I had someone who helped me build my reading habit” “I share all my personal issues and dreams with my mother. I feel my father is quite strict”

Through co-design and co-creation approach towards developing a "short term career counseling guide" we wish to build partnership with the youth themselves and connect them with existing counseling network, potential future career counselor to build character  and form new narrative around success.  It is essential for us to involve the employers, education system and policy makers right from the start.
