> Description

Using secondary data from various soruces, AccLabPy and a team of researchers from NorthEastern University (USA) generated proxy indexes of social capital and vulnerabilty and produced heat maps to identify "hot spots" where social capital was high in relation to the levels of vulnerability and "hold spots" where social capital was low in relation to the levels of vulnerabilty. Subjet to data quality, this type of map can serve to guide public policy decisiones.
