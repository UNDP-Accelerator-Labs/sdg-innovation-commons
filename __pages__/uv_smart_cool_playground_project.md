Natural Cooling

> Description of the solution

In March 2020, Cumberland City Council partnered with Western Sydney University (WSU) to research and develop innovative ways to make playgrounds safer for families and children during hot weather. It involved re-troffing emorial Park playground at Merrylands to improve thermal comfort and reduce ultraviolet radiation (UV). The project demonstrates a cost-effective method to retrofit existing playgrounds to be UV safe and heat smart. Cost savings will be realised through the modular construction of the shade, structure that can be relocated to and adjusted for the next playground once the newly planted trees provide shade.
