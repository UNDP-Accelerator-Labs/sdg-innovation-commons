> Title of the innovation

Eco plastic bottle bricks for construction &amp; waste bottle management

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is the collection of waste plastic and waste bottles and use them as bricks for construction, big containers like 20lts are used as hand washing station. this makes the community manage waste in a sustainable manner, and also impact their livelihood cause the cost of bulding materials are high so wen they use plastics they save money for other expenses

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate more income for me and other community members as the demand for handwashing station increases, many people will buy handwashing station especially in the midst of COVID-19 where it is a mandatory requirement for every house to have a handwashing station, not only in our homes also in commercial centers in shops hand washing station will be on demand. 
many tool will be able to demand structures made out of bottles for the structure made of plastic bottles are durable and can resists blasts shock made by explosives expecially houses near mine areas. additionally it will remove plastic waste and manage them in good way

> Technical Feasibility

we collect  plastic bottles, pack them with waste plastic, and sand and make a brick for construction., for 20lts plastic containers, we cut them on the neck, put  a tap below and make a hand washing station
we plan to 
1. collect 60000 empty plastics bottles waste and build houses for vulnerable and aged

> Anticipated Social Impact

The hand washing station will prevent people from contacting the COVID-19, and also it will promote general hygiene, especially handwashing practices. those involved in plastic collection will have a share in the business, cause bottles shall be bought from collectors.
people shall be able to build low cost structures such as toilet and houses
