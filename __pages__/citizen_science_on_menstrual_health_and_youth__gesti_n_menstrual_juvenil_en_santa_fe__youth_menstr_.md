## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Describe and analyze the meanings and practices of menstrual health management of young menstruating women aged 10 to 19 years in the province of Santa Fe. 

Collaboratively design possible territorial intervention strategies to be applied across institutions within the province. 
## Specific goals

Describe and analyze the material, cultural, and infrastructural aspects of the meanings and practices of menstrual health management of young menstruating women in Santa Fe. 

Identify and describe the main myths and taboos they have about menstruation. 

Systematize the main obstacles that young menstruating people identify to improve their menstrual management possibilities and devise initiatives for each of the identified areas. 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens (young menstruating people, social institutions, feminist and sexual dissident organizations) participate in data collection (surveyed through a form), analysis, and the design and implementation of solutions. During the first stage, work on co-management is carried out together with teachers, health professionals, and young people during workshops in the institutions where they work. Thus, the topic is introduced and interest in the issue is sought to be awakened so that young people become promoters of the survey. Afterward, meetings are held with the youth who participated in the survey (and the general public) to analyze the main results. These meetings will include an analysis phase and a phase aimed at the development of ideas for solutions.
