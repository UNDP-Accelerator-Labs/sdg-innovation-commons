## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Portfolios are a more coherent approach to investment decisions in the Country Office once the joint strategic intent is defined. 
2. The overhaul of the development work impact and design requires rethinking the fundamentals of how our
current structures operate and convincing both the staff and financing partners is difficult at times.
3. Portfolios further provide a different path to scale toward investing in multiple &amp; reinforcing interventions, as opposed to the fragmentized single-point solutions.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The Circular Economy portfolio was merged into a larger Green Transition portfolio with the owners now being two sectors in the CO.
