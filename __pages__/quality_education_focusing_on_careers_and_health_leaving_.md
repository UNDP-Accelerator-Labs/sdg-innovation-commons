> Title of the innovation

Quality Education focusing on careers and Health leaving.

> Brief description of the innovation

My main innovation is in Education and Health. Education wise is that government school are over clouded and we haven't had new secondary school in many years. My main focus is also to teach craft / career works on a serious note from primary school. We need to discover talents in year early age and start mentoring. We should shorten subjects taken in Primary ,Secondary then colleges and universities will follow suit. Subject taken will depend on the Crafts or Careers that one has interest in. We also need to shorten years of primary and secondary years. In Health I would love to teach young ones and elderly people, in short all ages on Health leaving. We have to take care of self first in order to help other people around us.
