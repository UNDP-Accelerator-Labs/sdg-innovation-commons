Family fun

> Brief description of the innovation

Family fun will be like a tourism site for many zambians Even the neighboring countries,it will consist of alot of fun and different plays for all age groups.it will be to the likes of every child and adults more like disney world.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Since most people will tour the place I will put across a charge for every person and other business will benefit in the sense that they can bring there business on board especially those with food items

> Technical Feasibility

How it is designed it's a plan without fund 
But once I have some one to fund this I will put it in motion,as for the prototype it's something that has yet to be put on paper and that's the more reason on the picture above have put something to define it all.
How I plan on implementing this is as follows:land
Resources
Man power
And mostly support from the government

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve lives in such a way that those with out jobs can be hired and not just those with diploma or degree,or grade 12 certificate can have a job and provide food for themselves.
