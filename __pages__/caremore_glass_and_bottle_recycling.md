> Brief description of the innovation

We turn glass waste into quality building materials such as building blocks pavers and tiles

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We make quality building blocks from glass waste and sale to local people in Kanyamacompound at an affordable price.
Our products are so competitive, durable and creates many job opportunities for the youths and other citizens.we also help to save natural resources such as river sand, stones and cutting down of trees as a result of quarrying.
We can use any available fund to grow our production and contribute to the GDP of our economy.

> Technical Feasibility

Our business plan has already started delivering on our drean. It is designed in such a way that we can use what we have to keep moving.we have started with our local community though our focus is to reach out all the provinces in Zambia and Africa. 
We have started with building blocks, later we shall extend to pavers and tiles and discover more products that can be made using glass waste.
