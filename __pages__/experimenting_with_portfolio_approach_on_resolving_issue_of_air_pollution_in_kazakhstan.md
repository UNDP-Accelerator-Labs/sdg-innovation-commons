## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Experimenting with portfolio approach on resolving issue of air pollution in Kazakhstan 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to systematize the ongoing activities, identify barriers towards enforcing existing and previously proposed action plans, and through identification of policy gaps create enabling environment in resolving persistent issue of air pollution in Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Almaty’s air quality challenges are acute: it is regularly ranked among the most polluted cities of the world. Major sources of air pollution include emissions from two coal-fired combined heat and power plants, transport, and residential and commercial heating. Air quality is exacerbated by Almaty’s geography, surrounded by mountains. Increases in air pollution are interwoven with economic development, population growth, and a local construction boom. While there are many “end-of-pipe” technological solutions to combat air pollution that are important parts of the solutions space, unhealthy air is itself an unpriced waste product, or externality, of the social and economic systems. With Almaty being the most politically active city of the country, the issue is well publicized. Many activist groups, NGOs and international organizations has been working to tackle the problem, albeit their efforts have been arguably fragmented and to date the situation with air quality has not changed much.

At the beginning of this year over 53 thousand people signed petition for the government of Kazakhstan to recognize the air pollution situation in Almaty to be an ecological disaster.  (link: https://alash.online/1525-ecology.html)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

A holistic and innovative strategic approach to air quality with focus on the health, urban space, entrepreneurship, and green economic development opportunities that could deliver on the city’s development goals while also contributing to cleaner air has a great potential to deliver significant positive results.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
