Bio sand water filters
Our focus is on eliminating Water borne diseases by providing plenty of safe water to both institutions
and households in a way that preserves our environment. In a country where keeping drinking water clean or even getting clean water in the first place is difficult, there are few communities that don’t face preventable illnesses like typhoid that come from these sources of water. Even pipes are not always safe. Traditionally, people then try and boil their water, which consumes a lot of charcoal and time. Then, the water is stored in pots and jerrycans, and if it wasn’t contamined during transport, bacteria will now easily enter.

This is a lot of effort for a small outcome. Tusafishe has inquired from the communities that there is a need for a better solution, and our solution is a simple one: Sand filters. Using the same principle as natural springs in the ground, it is simply a bucket filled with nothing but freshly ground granite. It filters particles, bacteria, even chemicals out of the water and makes it safe to drink. One small bucket filters up to 40 liters per day, enough for an average household. A large bucket has a capacity of 200 liters per day. And the more the filter is used, the more the material compacts – the water will get even cleaner over time. It’s „forever lasting“: The Tusafishe granite just needs to be washed and dried every few months and the bucket can be refilled right away.
