> Title of the innovation

Titume on-demand transport

> Brief description of the innovation

Transport is the biggest component in final price of commodities, hence small and medium enterprises are constrained to expand. Titume is a phone application that enables customers to connect with transporters and other vehicle owners to move cargo or goods to all parts of the country on-demand. The Application utilizes an in-built GPS to alert transporters of pending loads from would-be customers on pre-planned routes. An online calculator enables customers to know in advance the freight cost and make a booking, if desired, which alerts transporters of a pending load.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Every successful transaction (booking and pick-up) of a parcel/ package or cargo would attract a twelve percent (12%)  fee of the total transportation cost

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is made up of a smart phone application that can be downloaded from Play Store and I Store and a website to support the traffic and enable transactions as well as market the app.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation shall enable small and medium enterprises to utilise the excess capacities on trucks, buses and other vehicles to move goods at a fraction of the current cost of transport. This is enabled through the excess capacity aboard vehicles, which would also enable cost-sharing between transporters and would-be customers.
