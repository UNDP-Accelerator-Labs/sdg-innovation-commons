## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can Social Innovation Platform (SIP) approach to local governance foster better informed decision making that will improve basic service delivery to Pacific islanders?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF SIP approach to local governance is undertaken THEN decision making will be better informed by realities on the ground and will improve basic service delivery for Pacific islanders. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Design of SIP approach implemented in 3 locations (villages in Fiji) SIP workshop including deep listening and use of inclusive imaginary tool to gather insights, experiences, and voice of participants Co-creation and experimentation of interventions to improve local governance structures and basic service delivery

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Change in local governance structures and access to basic service deliveries in 3 Fijian villages

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Collective intelligence, inclusive imaginaries tool, deep listening, interviews.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 year

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

30% of Solution Mapper, Explorer, and Experimenter's time respectively
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

NA

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

NA

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

NA

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

NA

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Na

NA
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All governance teams.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government partners.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

NA

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

NA

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment can be replicated in any space that involves governance structures/ mechanisms.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This experiment is heavily influenced by the "test" phase more than the "sense" and "explore" phase.

> What surprised you?

NA
