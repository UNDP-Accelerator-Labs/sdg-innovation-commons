## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Telemedicine solution for improving health care services in remote areas. 


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The challenge is aiming to improve the health care services in the clinics located in the marginalized communities' neighborhoods (IDPs) and remote areas that doesn't have access to good quality medical services by injecting a Telemedicine solution into the already existing clinics.

  



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



  

The Access to health care in Somalia is considered one of the lowest indicators in the world due to the decades of instability and absence of public health services. The majority of populations seeks health care from the private hospitals and have to pay out a high cost in return to the treatment services. The situation varies from urban to rural areas in which circumstances are worse in the remote areas due to lack of both public and private health care centers. With the situation depressed by implications of Covid-19 and recurrent droughts, it’s important to explore new solutions to enable communities access to medical services.

The United Nations Development programme (UNDP) Accelerator Lab has created a partnership with United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) to jointly support and enhance the capacity of five youth/ community centers set up under an EU-funded UNFPA project in 5 cities. Through the partnership, UNDP is supporting the expansion of the service offer of the existing Centers by experimenting with the telemedicine equipment to enhance the quantity and  quality of health services currently provided by the Centers’ clinics. UNDP is supporting the centers to obtain the equipment, installation services and hands-on training to the clinic’s health workers, to enable the center’s current health facilities seek specialized medical services, clinical guidance and support from specialized doctors in the city’s major hospitals and from Diaspora’s doctor network interested to voluntarily conduct medical services from distance to the clients of the center’s clinic coming from marginalized communities including IDPs.

The initiative is aiming to provide a free or low cost, high quality medical services to the center’s neighborhoods beneficiaries of young people and marginalized communities and provide them access to greater services, improve youth center’s doctors knowledge by enabling them share experience, exchange knowledge with their peers from well-established health service providers, as well as promoting potential use of telemedicine solutions in the country to facilitate access to medical services by populations living in remote areas with limited access of health care.

According to Un Independant expert on the situation human rights in Somalia, access to health care remains dangerously low in the country. we are planning to analyze recorded data prior introducing Telemedicine solution to t five community centers to use as a baseline and conduct a endline survey to measure the value the telemedicine solution could bring to the community in terms of changes of beneficiaries' numbers and types of services.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Lab has identified this opportunity to work with other UN partners and community centers to explore ways to facilitate access to health care services by communities living in remote areas with limited access to specialized medical services.
