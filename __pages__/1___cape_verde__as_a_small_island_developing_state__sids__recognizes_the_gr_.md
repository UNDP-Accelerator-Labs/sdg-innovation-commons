## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1 - Cape Verde, as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) recognizes the great potential in the maritime economy, with its vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and related resources. The sector is a national priority and strategic planning has been developed by authorities and international partners to unlock this potential and promote investments in ports and maritime transport, fisheries, renewable energy and other related areas. The country Cape Verde is also rich in globally significant biodiversity. The country's coastal zones and EEZ provide habitat for extensive marine biodiversity with a significant number of endemic and emblematic species.   2 - We discovered during project implementation that each island has a different focus regarding blue economy. In Fogo Island, participants have more focus on biodiversity and the use of local and endogenous products for cosmetics, agriculture or ecotourism. In Sal island, the most touristic island in the country, participants tend to focus more on water sports and on promoting the island flagship sports such as kitesurfing and windsurfing, with surfing schools, and also diving. São Vicente Island, as the center of blue economy in Cape Verde, presents a greater diversity of opportunities and potential, from digital transformation of the sector to services that add value to economic operators.   3 – The need for semi-industrial fishing is transversal to all islands, whereby everyone recognizes the need to structure projects for vessels of this caliber and improve fishing conditions and capacity.   4 - Proposed innovations include Cosmetics with therapeutic potential, Tourism and conservation of marine species; Virtual underwater diving simulator for educational, tourism and environmental purposes; Surf and water sports school; Production of a macrolake and brine shrimp to feed species in aquaculture; and Ice production and fish conservation for fishermen and fishmongers in a fishing village, among other solutions.   5 - Winning solutions from the different editions of Blue Hack should be implemented with the support of business incubators / accelerators accredited in our entrepreneurship ecosystem, namely those linked to the blue economy. There are some options available.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Fishermen, divers and fishmongers have some difficulty participating in events like this given their work schedule and because of income loss fears, hence the difficulty in attract them in lager scale. It is good idea to work with some fishermen community associations as intermediary to reach this target group. Enrolments / subscriptions via online platforms may not work well in this context. Local partnerships with associations and other institutions (public or ONGs) to help applicants apply to the program works better.   The diversity of ages, professional areas and levels of education also represented a challenge. The role of mentors in the process is very important.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To support the challenge, we documented 10 thematic areas within blue economy, including Fisheries and Aquaculture, Coastal/Sustainable Tourism, Marine Pollution and Waste Management, Marine Biotechnology, Climate Change, Digitization and Maritime Industry, etc. For this, we started with open data and public reports on the sector. We faced the challenge of lack regularity and coverage of statistical data in the sector, which are very scarce.   Within each thematic area, specific problem statements were developed to direct participants to concrete opportunities and challenges, and align the work to be developed with the reality of the sector. For this, we conducted surveys to operators and associations in the blue economy sector and in-depth interviews and workshop sessions to develop the problem statements, that were shared in the Blue Hack web site for the applicants to choose upon application to the program.   Data on the applicants was collected through an application form in the Call for Solutions phase, that was used to survey information about the applicants, including general information, location, education, skills, etc. This application form was also used to start crowdsource solutions for the problem statements in blue economy.   During the hackathon workshops, mentorship and coaching sessions were undertaken to help participants develop their projects and pith their ideas. Business models, market assessments, prototypes were developed. Spreadsheets, documents and presentations were made, and this information organized per team.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The general objective was to engage with local communities around blue economy sectors to support innovation and development of sustainable local-based solutions to address opportunities in blue economy and SIDS challenges in the country with a collective intelligence approach.   To create an an environment conducive to ideation and creativity with local communities and help small operators, entrepreneurs, start-ups, innovators and students to develop their ideas, an innovation challengein hackathon format was launched in 3 different locations to test solutions development in different circumstances within the blue economy sector in Cabo Verde.   The process begins with the presentation of the challenges by thematic specialists / speakers, followed by teams’ formation. Then, the teams work with technical and management areas mentors linked to the blue economy to develop their solutions, combining Human-Centered Design (HCD) approaches, to bring empathy and emerge in livelihoods and local challenges, and Design Thinking, as a practical, collaborative and iterative way of understanding and solving problems in multidisciplinary teams to co-create solutions and develop prototypes to the selected challenge.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In order to document the thematic areas and develop the problem statements in blue economy and nature-based solutions, we worked with 3 environmental organizations and associations in different islands: Projeto VITO in Fogo Island, Projeto Biodiversidade in Sal and Bioesfera 1 in São Vicente Island. They provided sector field/local knowledge and documentation. In later phases, they provided mentors and coachers to help teams develop their solutions and jury members in some cases to help evaluate the final solutions presented.   In São Vicente Island, we worked with a fishermen community association of São Pedro, that help involve fishermen, divers and fishmongers in the challenge with one team, developing a solution for the community.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

3 universities were involved in the Blue Hack 2022 with the purpose of obtaining expertise and information about the blue economy sector, mobilizing participants and providing mentors and speakers for the workshops: E-Mar (Escola do Mar), UTA (University of the Atlantic) and UNI-CV (University of Cabo Verde).   E-Mar is a university especially created in São Vicente to provide courses, graduation and investigation in maritime economy and sea sciences. They were with the organization of the Ocean Week 2022 and provided us the venue and logistic support in São Vicente’s hackathon edition.   They also promoted the participation of their students (in last year of graduation) in the initiative.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Regarding governmental partners, we worked with the Institute of Employment and with the Maritime and Ports Institute, for logistic support, participants engagement, outreach and visibility. They also provided sector expertise in defining the thematic areas and developing the problem statements and contributed with mentors and jury members for the hackathon dynamics.   We also worked with the Municipality of São Filipe in Fogo Island, that helped us engage locally with communities and target- groups. They also provided contacts and intelligence on local opportunities and challenges.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Bringing together civil society, universities and public sector organizations to work together with start-ups and entrepreneurs in the same initiative is innovative and allows for synergies and knowledge sharing that are very important and benefic for all involved.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We explored linkages with FAO and with the Joint Office Environment and Climate Change portfolio. FAO has a very important intervention in the blue economy in Cabo Verde and provided us sector expertise and support, especially for São Vicente Island edition.    We worked very closely with the office Environment Portfolio for the initiative, from the very beginning. Our colleague Sonia Lopes was appointed for the Hackathon Project Team and helped us a lot with sector expertise and partners contacts. She helped review the concept note, introduced the concept of Nature Based Solutions to the challenge helped throughout the process. She was Jury member in the final hackathon in São Vicente.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The process begins with the definition of a set of thematic areas, on which the teams will focus to develop their solutions. Following the methodology, we help the teams immerge in the problem and develop an Empathy Map and then work on the customer journey and an experience map. With these elements, a sketch phasefollows, where the teams develop their Business Model Canvas by applying market concepts such as TAM1, SAM2 and SOM3, and create services and prototypes. With the business model developed, the next step is a final presentation to the hackathon’s jury in a 5-minute pitch. The pitch deck includes the development of a storyboard. More than 15 solutions for the blue economy were developed in Blue Hack to address challenges and opportunities on the various islands.   (1) Total Addressable Market (2) Serviceable Addressable Market (3) Serviceable Obtainable Market
