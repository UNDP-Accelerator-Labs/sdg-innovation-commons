## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Depopulation Portfolio Operationalisation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that adapting to demographic change requires system transformation and a whole-of-society approach. Turning a new narrative, which defines trajectories for action and an extensive landscape of possible interventions, into an actionable portfolio and operationalising it with the Government of the Republic of Serbia.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Depopulation is a long-term trend for many countries, with Serbia among the fastest-shrinking in the world. It is a complex challenge with multiple root causes and several aspects moving at different speeds.

Although the pandemic has slowed down out-migration, in the past year Serbia reached a decade-long maximum of the total number of deaths and the overall mortality rate.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Official data from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia indicate that In 2021 Serbia had the highest number of deaths since World War II. In 2021, Serbia lost almost 74,000 people due to the negative population growth.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

A weak signal: we see that out-migration is speeding up after the EU countries have started relaxing COVID measures (our experiment https://measuring-depopulation.org)


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Tackling depopulation is a strategic bet made by management for the entire CO, with the Accelerator Lab leading the work. The Lab has been engaged on the issue since its establishment in Serbia, reframing the challenge, exploring different aspects, testing ideas, establishing new partnerships, and designing a portfolio around depopulation. The approach employs “bleeding edge” thinking on tackling complex development problems.

The Lab is uniquely positioned to take this work into its next stage, including partnership building, operationalization, having a team working on depopulation within the Prime Minister’s Office, further learning to articulate and refine the entry points, and onboarding three colleague to lead the portfolio into its growth stage.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Responding to a declining population means prioritizing human development. Demographic change requires adaptive policies and new development approaches that help us learn about complex systems.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The depopulation portfolio will be anchored with the Office of the Prime Minister. A new team of 3 advisors (Integration Unit) have been recruited, and the onboarding process is starting, supported by the Accelerator Lab in operationalizing the portfolio within Government. In addition, the onboarding and handholding of this team, as well as quality assurance of their initial work, will be part of the Lab’s responsibilities in 2022.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to best support the new team within the Prime Minister Office (Integration Unit) that will work on the operationalisation of the depopulation portfolio?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

In order to proceed with the operationalization of the portfolio, a different set of innovative methods and approaches will be required including co-creation as a joint/participatory way of working, deep listening in order to understand human perspectives, human-centric design for creating the set of different products and services that are in line with real people’s need and expectations. This phase of development will include a portfolio of experiments centred on a variety of themes, sub-groups, geographic areas, and novel ideas.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

these sources are closer to real time.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to support the growth phase of the newly established organisation Returning Point that was incubated as a UNDP project in 2021? 

Returning Point is a program for circular migration that went from the mapped initiative to the project that UNDP incubated through the Initiation plan to a stand-alone organisation with which UNDP is entering in a new type of partnership. This entry point of the portfolio went through the entire learning cycle during these Lab years (2020-2021): Sense, Explore, Test, and Grow. This entry point will continue in 2022 as a spinoff that we supported and guided as it grew into an independent and standalone organization.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Supporting a newly formed organization for circular migration, relying on human-centred design in order to better understand the Serbian diaspora and returnees as well as to promote a new narrative and framing of migration. With Returning Point, we hope to use a variety of innovative approaches to re-establish trust between Serbian society here and abroad while also rethinking new and innovative ways to connect the two groups, especially through the use of digital technologies. AccLab believes that this can be accomplished through a number of initiatives that we can co-design in order to probe the system and change the narrative surrounding circular migration, coming and leaving Serbia, as well as reintegration into Serbian society and culture. This will also include a portfolio of experiments centred on a variety of themes, sub-groups, geographic areas, and novel ideas about migration during the organization's development phase (podcasts, vibrant Viber community, online meetups, events, etc.).

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The need for constant feedback from Serbian diaspora and returnees in order to create a) better products and services, b) tailor-made messages/comms, and c) knowledge base of relevant content 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The entire ecosystem of stakeholders that we activated will benefit from this work. The PMO might become a champion.

Highest levels of policy-making; Local governments; broad academic/social policy community; diaspora organizations; grassroots organizations in depopulating communities; women’s organizations and groups; service providers to older persons; private sector, especially: foreign investors short of labor force, businesses in affected areas; governments of countries with large Serbian diasporas; the EU.
