The main motivation of GREEN HUMAN CITY is a broad unification of activists and ordinary citizens behind specific projects within the framework of thematic efforts.  These projects are generated through three sources: 1. The expertise of the activist organizations that make up ZHG 2. Citizens' proposals on the MojGrad platform, created and administered by ZHG, and 3. The demands of the protest movements in which ZHG participates ZHG's goal is to integrate projects from these three sources and to represent them as policies in local institutions, in parallel with an agenda for progressive institutional transformation aimed at transferring power from the political and business elite to the citizens. Thematic efforts: Urban mobility, Animal protection, Clean environment, Energy independence, Sustainable development, Social justice Organizational principles: Horizontality, Inclusiveness, Transparency
