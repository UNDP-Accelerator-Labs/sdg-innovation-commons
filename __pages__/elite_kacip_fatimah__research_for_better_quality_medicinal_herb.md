The elite kacip fatimah (FaFa01) is a result of rigorous research to cultivate kacip fatimah that possesses the high medicinal properties. Cultivating this elite Kacip Fatimah is known to be better than the normal ones found in the forest because of a few aspects, namely the propagation rate, yield per hectare, biomass, survivability, and its bioactive compounds. The elite species can produce 15% more in terms of yield as compared to the normal or wild variety.  It does not only prove its sustainability and ability to yield better results than others, but it speaks volumes of how it can benefit society.
