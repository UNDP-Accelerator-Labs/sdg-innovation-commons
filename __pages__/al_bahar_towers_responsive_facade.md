> Description of the solution

Aedas Architects designed a responsive facade which takes cultural cues from the ‚Äúmashrabiya‚Äù a traditional Islamic lattice shading device. Completed in June 2012, the 145 meter towers was developed by computational design using parametric description for the geometry of the actuated facade panels. The screen operates as a curtain wall sitting two meters outside the buildings exterior on an independent frame. Each triangle is coated with fiberglass and programmed to respond to the movement of the sun as a way to reduce solar gain and glare. In the evening all the screens will close and it reduces solar gain by 50%.
