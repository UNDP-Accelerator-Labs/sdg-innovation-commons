> Brief description of the innovation

Waana Healthcare plans to be Zambia's first online healthcare store where customers can order all healthcare products and delivered to where they are anywhere in Zambia. The main goal of the innovation is to improve people's accessibility to quality and affordable healthcare products.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate income through direct sale of healthcare products on our online e-commerce store and through shipment costs. Existing businesses will benefit from us through partnerships. Our target market includes people of all sex groups or orientations and an age group of 18 to 75. The challenge prize will help us complete our website, get transportation equipments, marketing and research. Through digital transmission of data, our innovation will help reduce paper waste created by organizations thereby creating an environmentally friendly business.

> Technical Feasibility

Waana Healthcare is an online healthcare store which provides healthcare products to customers. Customers can login into the website and order any healthcare product they need. Once an order is executed, the product is delivered to the customers doorstep anywhere in Zambia. This is to be implemented through the creation of a website, effective internet marketing, effective transport system, research and partnership with existing brick and mortar businesses that sale healthcare products like pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers. We plan to grow our business through provision of customer buying experience on our website, quick deliveries, provision of quality and cost effective products and having a huge social media presence. With enough seed money we plan to achieve this within 12 months.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will help improve Zambian's accessibility to quality and affordable healthcare products needed to live a quality and healthy life. It will also help improve small businesses in Zambia through partnerships. Last but on the least, the innovation will seek to provide employment opportunities to many Zambian youths thereby helping tackle the unemployment problem in the country.
