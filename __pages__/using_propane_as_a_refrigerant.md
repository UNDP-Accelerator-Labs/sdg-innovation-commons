> Description of the solution

New study found that switching to propane as a refrigerant could lessen the global temperature increase from space cooling, meaning that we could avoid a 0.09¬∞C increase in global temperature by the end of the century, making a significant contribution toward keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 ¬∞C.
