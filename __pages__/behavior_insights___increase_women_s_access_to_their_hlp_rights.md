Behavior Insights - Increase women's access to their HLP Rights 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge is that societal norms and behaviours largely driven by patriarchal structures constrains and disincentivizes women’s access to House, land, and property, including women’s own preconceptions and fears that deter them from pursuing their HLP rights. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Although women in Syria are, to a certain extent, legally entitled to housing, land and property (HLP) rights, enshrined in law and institutionally supported, women’s access to HLP is often not realised due to a lack of government service capacity and infrastructure, as well as a variety of technical and economic factors. However, predominantly, psychosocial factors across a wide spectrum of actors associated with women’s HLP constrains women’s access. Indeed, societal norms and behaviours largely driven by patriarchal structures constrains and disincentivizes women’s access to HLP, including women’s own preconceptions and fears that deter them from pursuing their HLP rights. Prior to the conflict, several studies dealing with the reality of women’s inheritance of land in rural and urban areas began in the early 1990s to draw attention to this historical inequality. Field studies focused on the economic and social reality of rural women in Syria, noting the trend whereby women incrementally lose their rights to properties, which cause longer-term socio-economic consequences.[1] Efforts in awareness raising campaigns coupled with a general increase in the level of women’s education successfully brought attention to this issue and women began to demand their rights to inherit land from their parents, although however, the number of women that owned property still remained low. However, After the conflict, the already challenging situation got even worse; women are not able to access or inherit their rights because they are lacking civil and HLP documentation, particularly in the case of death of family members or missing persons. Women are also greatly impacted by the failure of the other party (the husband’s family or male brothers) to confirm the death of the missing person (the husband, father or son). But still, the main barrier that women is facing when it comes to accessing their HLP rights is behavioural; These behavioural dynamics are often derived from cultural practices, customs and traditions that are perpetuated across Syria, particularly in rural areas of the country. Women pursuing HLP rights are often faced with reprisals in various forms, largely including physical violence towards them, as well as family members forcefully taking control of their property, with further repercussions such as stigmatisation in their communities. Based on UNDP Syria’s experience and research, these norms and behaviours is affecting women’s access to HLP rights which in turn is reflected in women having an unequal access and participation in HLP-related institutions and land administration processes, lack of access to dispute resolution mechanisms to challenge inheritance biases that benefit males over females, as well as missing financing and micro-financing opportunities offered by institutions. Increasing women access to justice is highly important at this stage of Syria’s early recovery context, where securing women’s HLP rights can help support wider peace dividends; by empowering women’s access to HLP rights in communities and wider Syrian society, stability, and equality for organising Syria’s fragmented territories can be achieved, thus mitigating a source of conflict in the process. Under the UNDP Syria’s ‘Mizan project’ UNDP aimed to raise legal awareness and provide legal counselling to the community members across 10 neighbourhoods in eastern Aleppo. The Project engaged 123 volunteers, lawyers, academics and local community members to support implementation.  3,839 individuals benefited from Mizan services and closed with over 2,000 people on the waiting list for support. The Project showed an average increase of the beneficiaries’ knowledge and understanding across general legal issues, civil status, civil law, and personal status issues (by at least 15%).  Key findings indicated that individuals, particularly women, are more likely to exercise their rights after legal awareness sessions.  However, in many cases, women still may be afraid of afraid to act on this new acquired information.  As a next step, UNDP will aim to have a closer look at how behaviour insights may be applied to increasing access to justice for women by identifying key areas to target behaviour change.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We want to explore how overcoming behavioral barriers can improve women in accessing their HLP rights. We will work with an external BI consultancy to identify drivers of inheritance bias that benefit male over females and behavioral barriers that is preventing women from pursuing their HLP rights and to design a behavioral insight experiment to address these barriers. Learnings and outcome of the consultancy is expected to inform the design of future UNDP interventions. In collaboration with the accelerator lab and through the engagement of targeted community and stakeholders, the service provider will identify entry points for behavioral insights (BI) interventions, and design and implement a behavioral insight experiment to nudge (communities male/female) targeted under Mizzen Project to increase rate of women pursuing their right in court in the context of Syria.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are applying BI to be able to map behavioral barriers and to design our solutions that will be piloted 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Although we are able to understand knowledge gaps and identify some structural barriers, there is still limited data when it comes to mapping behavioral barriers linked to women access to justice
