Refugees creating their own Opportunities in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement
OPPORTUNIGEE creates a self-organized empowerment and social entrepreneurship hub in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement (home to 100,000 people) in Uganda. The space is open for everyone, owned and run by the refugees themselves. It provides internet, tools, learning resources and tutorials on how to use the internet for research and the creation of projects. Design Thinking and Lean Startup push the refugees to test ideas and find solutions to the problems they face and create social enterprises to sustain themselves.
