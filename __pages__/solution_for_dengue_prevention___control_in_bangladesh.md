The Bangladesh Accelerator Lab organized a Women’s Digital Innovation hackathon to promote ICT skills and innovation practices to female students and professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of SDG challenges. The third place wining women's hackathon team designed an Artificial Intelligence based Dengue Monitor & Control System which can effectively predict dengue outbreaks in different areas of an urban city depending on weather, garbage data, mobility, google search records, Aedes mosquito population survey data etc. This is a vital solution as Dengue is one of the major public health challenges of Bangladesh. The picture shows the participants of the team that designed this solution.
