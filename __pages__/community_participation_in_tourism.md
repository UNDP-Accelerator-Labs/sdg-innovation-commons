## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Community participation in Tourism
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Local communities that live in areas were tourism is taking place do not benefit economically from the natural resources around them

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Community-based tourism (CBT) is already being promoted in many of these destinations as a strategy to improve livelihood and provide alternative source of income to the marginalized communities. However, Community- Led participation in Tourism is yet to bear fruits. For example, a study that was conducted in Livingstone to investigate community tourism participation showed that over half of the residents (57%) do believe that they participate in the tourism sector. The participation levels were lowest (32%) in the case of low-income households. Tourism participation was "framed" by residents as occurring through the medium of employment or from engagement in income generating activities, and not through visiting tourist sites for leisure purposes.

Communities perceived tourism to be for foreigners and that they did not benefit from it. The study concluded that there is need to implement initiatives that enhance community participation in tourism-related decision making at local level, in income generation, and employment. These changes would lead to more favourable tourism perceptions among residents. Based on this context the Zambia Accelerator Lab seeks to examine the potential and viability of Community based tourism livelihood projects as a strategy for employment creation and poverty reduction especially in rural areas.

Zambia has significant potential for tourism and offers a wealth of natural tourism assets.  Attractions include Victoria Falls - one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World and a UNESCO Heritage site – abundant lakes and rivers, and wildlife-protected areas in the form of 20 national parks and 34 game management areas that together occupy some 10 percent of the country’s total land area. Zambia is also endowed with a rich and diverse culture that enjoys more than 30 colourful traditional ceremonies annually. However, this sector continues to underperform and remains underutilized, and thus creating opportunities for improvement. [1]

In 2019, Zambia generated over 820million US dollars in the tourism sector alone. This corresponds to 3.7 percent of the gross domestic product. This figure was greatly reduced in 2020 due to the restrictions in movement  associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. [2]

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is working on this challenge as its providing a proof of concept to the other units within the country office that they can use to develop full fledged projects.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

If local Communities are involved in tourism, they will take part in conservation and benefit from the proceeds of the sector to improve their livelihoods? We need to understand what is creating the barriers for local communities to participate in the Tourism sector.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The methods will help in data collection, piloting and getting the evidence to prove the concept of community involvement in tourism.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These new data sources provide information that we cannot obtain from the other methods and triangulates the information obtained.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are collaborating with the Strategy and Policy Unit in the country office for the initiative. and the results of our work will be passed on to the Environment unit for scaling.
