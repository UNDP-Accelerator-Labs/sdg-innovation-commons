## Overall goal

Analyze habits related to the running of the internal clock controlling daily (circadian) rhythms in the Argentine population through its interaction with an app called Mi Reloj Interno [My Internal Clock]. 

Generate an algorithm to provide personalized recommendations to optimize rest. 
## Specific goals

Develop and implement the Mi Reloj Interno app for mobile devices as an educational and interactive tool on the status and evolution of the participating citizens’ internal clocks. 

Analyze the effect of age, self-perceived gender, and geographic location of the app users on the improvements resulting from the follow-up of the recommendations given. 
## Description of citizen participation

The role of the citizens includes data collection and analysis, as well as the design of solutions, although these roles vary according to the stages of the project. Citizens were involved from the beginning of the project in the collection of data used to design the algorithm for the Mi Reloj Interno app, in which more than 4,000 people from all over the country participated. Once the app was developed, users kept contributing to data collection through the use of the tool. So far, more than 10,000 people from all over the country have participated in this stage. A group of citizens will be trained to take part in the analysis and interpretation of data from a set of people “of which they are in charge”. In addition, citizens will collaborate directly with the design of future improvements of the app through suggestions (such as the wording of prompts, feedback format, inclusion of notifications, and aspects related to local or regional characteristics).
