## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) Accelerator lab conducted the experiment of waste transportation within 36 residential houses in the three selected cities namely, Bahir Dar, Adama, and Addis Ababa. During the 4 weeks exercise a total of 4061 Kg of solid waste was collected from the selected neighborhoods. Out of the total collected waste, only 771.6 Kg is segregated into two major categories (organic and inorganic). Women are mostly responsible for waste segregation and disposal, 68 % of the household waste was disposed of by female members of the household.  Family members in the age range of 15 to 30 are the most responsible ones for waste disposal (37 %) followed by the 45 to 60 age range (27 %). In the experiment, facilitating households with the tools and information to manage their waste helped households to see the value in their waste. some households that have been provided with different types of sacks for waste collection have better waste segregating practices.  Behavior and attitudinal change interventions should target women and young members of the family as these groups of households are mostly responsible for waste disposal. Interventions in schools could have the potential to bring change. Behavior and attitude change interventions should also include waste collectors and transporters because some of the waste collectors were found to be reluctant about waste segregation during this exercise. In addition, it is crucial to create a better value and sustainable market for organic waste 
   2)The main objective of our experiment was to validate the hypothesis from the behavioral study, i.e., to see if improved technology particularly a pushcart with a solution for segregated waste compartments will improve waste segregation behavior at the household level.  In the end, we didn’t see a clear pattern between the promotion of a pushcart with compartments for segregated waste and household waste segregation behavior. In this case, the argument made by municipalities that “households are not segregating their waste because waste transporters/collectors don’t have separate waste collection carts for different types of waste and consequently are mixing the waste” may not make sense.  Behavior and attitude change are essential in ensuring sustainable and long-lasting waste management practices. Using incentives whether monetary or emotion-based has been found to influence people’s behavior and practices in waste management. For example, model households were found to have better waste segregating practices.       
 3) From the deep dive exercise conducted at the early stages of this process, we learned that it took the waste collectors about two hours to collect all the waste from the neighborhood and temporarily store it at collection points. With the new prototypes, it took waste collectors only about 75 minutes to collect an equivalent size of waste with a similar group. The main reasons for this are.    The prototypes are stable and easy to operate. As a result, all the operators can participate in loading/unloading activities.   The prototypes have extendable loading capacity depending on the type of road and waste which helped waste collectors to collect more volume of waste in a single batch.    Because of the tilted design of the pushcart unloading time is reduced by 50 % to 60 % compared to the traditional pushcarts.   The smaller size pushcart prototype was convenient for women members of the enterprises and increased their active participation in door-to-door waste collection.    No/insignificant time off for maintenance during working hours.     
 4) The lab integrates an understanding of supply chain issues for the push carts including the availability of raw materials, and manufacturing skills particularly welding, electric power, and maintainability to ensure the scale-up and sustainability issue. Establishing a sustainable product supply chain involves three aspects in particular: good raw materials, good technical skills, and good design. Quality control is then necessary to ensure these aspects are maintained at a high level and there existing capacities like Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutes to ensure product quality. . The raw materials for the pushcarts are well specified in the design and tested to be accessible in the selected cities and mostly at zonal and regional levels.  The test also confirmed that there are qualified welding and fabrication workshops to fabricate the cart in the selected cities.  However, it is apparent that there should be a strategy and division of roles and responsibilities among actors to ensure adoption by the users.  
   5) The lab team measured the usability of the prototypes with three metrics: effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Effectiveness relates to the goal of using the product to the accuracy and completeness with which these goals can be achieved. Common measures of effectiveness include time of task completion, frequency of maintenance, frequency of assistance to the user from the testers. It does not take account of how the goals were achieved, only the extent to which they were achieved. Efficiency relates the level of effectiveness achieved to the quantity of resources expended. Three municipality experts and nine waste collectors/transporters participated in this user acceptability testing and below is the average scoring of the participants.       Metrics (Average)   Effectiveness    (0 to 5)   Efficiency    (0 to 5)   satisfaction    (0 to 5)   Prototype 1   4.7   4.5   4.5   Prototype 2   4.4   4.4   4.7   Prototype 3   4.2   3.9   3.7   0 = very poor, 1 = poor, 2 = satisfactory, 3 = good, 4 = very good, 5 = excellent.    The team made some design amendments as per the user’s feedback mainly on center of mass, angle of the handle and leg arm of the pushcart.

Behavior Matters: Insights from Solid Waste transportation Experiment

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Behavior and attitude change interventions should also include waste collectors and transporters because some of the waste collectors were found to be reluctant about waste segregation during this exercise.  For scale-up, there should be a strategy and division of roles and responsibilities among actors to ensure adoption by the users. Many of the key questions revolve around these responsibilities, the need for subsidies or other methods of financial support, and what forms of support infrastructure need to be in place.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The field experimentation involves direct interviews and Participatory observation to see how the households value their waste and their waste segregating practices which enable us to generate on what Behavior and attitudinal change interventions should look like.    We have designed an experiment by integrating a behavioral insight tool study to validate the hypothesis from the behavioral study, i.e., to see if improved technology particularly a pushcart with a solution for segregated waste compartments will improve waste segregation behavior at the household level using ethnography tools. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- The lab used Human Centered Design as a tool to co-create the pushcart prototypes and started the design process with a deep dive exercise to understand the user journey and generate insights for design. After the deep dive, we brought together municipality solid waste experts, waste collectors and leaders of waste collecting and transportation companies and associations for a co-creation exercise. The exercise enabled us to explore the prominent challenges associated with solid waste collection, transportation, the respective potential technological solutions & business models that help to efficiently collect and transport solid waste from a household.  - Accelerator Lab also organized a three-day Bootcamp with the aim to build project staff and implementing partners’ capacity for design thinking, user-centered product testing, and enhancing the culture of experimentation and co-experiment pushcart prototypes for efficient municipal solid waste collection and user feedback for improvement.     
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Yes    - Waste sorting, Collecting, and transportation associations and companies.     The lab works with them on a human center design workshop as well on the field experimentation phase to experiment with the solution we co-create with them through prototyping.

 - UNDP: Sheger project  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

- Using unusual data sources as well as bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight within a short period of time in different topics as well-diversified learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implemented in a previous implementation form. It enables us to see different insights which we didn’t see in the normal project implementation ways. It also enables us to use fewer resources since we have done many activities through collaboration with other partners which makes the lab approach less resource incentive method.
