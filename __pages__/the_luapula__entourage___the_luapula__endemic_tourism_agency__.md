> Title of the innovation

The Luapula 'EnTourAge' (The Luapula 'Endemic Tourism Agency).

> Brief description of the innovation

The official title of my innovation is The Luapula 'EnTourage' - which is the brand acronym for my innovation's full official title: The Luapula 'Endemic Tourism Agency'.
      The core business of the Luapula 'EnTourAge' will be to promote local (or endemic) tourism by organizing highly-incentivized visits for local tourists to and from local tourism destinations that include facilities, sites, events, occasions, activities etc.
     The Luapula 'EnTourAge' innovation is a brainchild of my Mansa-Based, PACRA-registered and self-named consultancy called 'Aston Kuseka Innovations' (A.K.Innovs).
     Originally, I conceived my maiden local tourism promotion business idea in 2008 while serving on the historic 'Destination Luapula' Tourism and Investment Promotion Committee which birthed the concept of the Luapula Tourism Exposition and Investment Forum which was successfully held in 2017 .
    Progressively, my 2008 local tourism promotion business idea got crystalized in 2017 when I actually attended the Luapula Expo 2021.
   Ultimately, here is the 2021 National Innovation Initiative challenge - the lifetime opportunity for me to showcase and realize my undying 2008 dream through my Luapula 'EnTourAge' innovation!

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My Luapula 'EnTourAge' innovation has great potential for commercial viability based on vast potential to:
1. Generate income for me from the variety of user-payments for my venture's characteristic innovative services, products, facilities, etc to be offloaded on the market,
2. Generate income for other market players it will commercially interact with along the local tourism value-chain.
      Additionally, my Luapula 'EnTourAge' innovation can potentially assist in improving the operations of other businesses through the following opportunities it will avail them:-
1. A Luapula 'EnTourAge' platform to promote their own businesses.
2. A Luapula 'EnTourAge' partnership for mutually beneficial ventures.
3. Access to the Luapula 'EnTourAge' client-base.
      My primary target market in this particular innovation are the local high-income workers, entrepreneurs, executives, personalities, leaders, groups, communities, organizations etc who are hitherto starved of tourism opportunities.
     Further, a highly-incentivized inclusive pro-poor package will be on offer in order not to leave anyone behind in this Luapula "EnTourAge' revolution.
     Inspirationally, the NII prize will guarantee the growth/success of my Luapula "EnTourAge" venture by helping me acquire the necessary startup requisites like formalization, capital, equipment, accommodation, materials, services and personnel
    Lastly, since tourism and the environment are intimate bedfellows, one of my Luapula "EnTourAge" innovation's key business policies is to ensure its maximum promotion of, and participation in, all external environmental protection efforts at all levels of our provincial community.
