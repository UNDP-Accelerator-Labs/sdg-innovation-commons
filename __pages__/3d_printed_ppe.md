3D Printed PPE: The Samuel Jackman Prescod Institute of Technology (SJPI)  in Barbados produced 2000 safety shields and 700 3-D masks for front line health care workers in the country. These items are being produced using  3-D  Printers within the Division of Mechanical Engineering and Printing.  Principal Ian Drakes explained that the 3-D printers were acquired as part of grant funding from the IA DB – “Skills for the Future Project “. The project is fully funded by the Maria Holder Memorial Trust.
