## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. With CI, design of sustainable solutions to complex systems is possible through democratizing decision making.


2. With CI, we were able to combine community knowledge of the area, previous interventions and amplify knowledge to design better for the community.

3. With CI + prototyping and Rapid Testing of initial ideas, we can quickly learn what would work and what would not, hence saving time and resources.

4. CI sessions allow for community building towards solving a common challenge and ownership of individual contributions to the problem and solution.

5. Kampala City generates 2,500 tones of garbage daily. Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) https://www.kcca.go.ug/news/679/

6. By-Law to be created by Community members led by the Local Council.  “For the very first time we have met as a community on this issue of waste management, we must create a by-law to regulate reckless disposal of garbage to avoid clogging the drainage system which leads to floods ” Mr. Kibuuka , LC 1 Chairman MakerereKavule Kigunddu Zone

7. Community members organize themselves to mobilize resources for garbage collection.  “We will not wait for KCCA to come collect our rubbish, we the Landlords, need to work with our tenants and collect UGX 1000 (less than a dollar) each house and we hire a private waste collection company to collect the garbage ” Mr. ZZiwa , landlord MakerereKavule Sebina Zone

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We have not yet handed over this process. This is because of the fact that there is still some learnings to record. However, in our Journey, we are working with Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) who asked us to review their Strategic Plan based on the learnings from this process. This is going to be done in the year 2024 after documenting lessons from the pending experiments on Waste management and using the local knowledge and expertise to construct the drainage tributaries.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose to use open data, mobile phone data and geospatial data to help us map the geographical area of the community to identify suitable locations for the construction of the the small drainage tributaries that connect to the main drainage channel. They will also help in the identification of appropriate sites for waste disposal as well as other solutions to this problem.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Using those types of innovation methods helped to address the decision-making gap because it looed at how involving communities in solving their climate related challenges can yield solutions that are citizen centric and sustainable. Working with the community in Makerere Kavule, we were able to design a waste management system for their community that involved citizens and leadership structures and map the drainage systems that would reduce the flooding in the area.
