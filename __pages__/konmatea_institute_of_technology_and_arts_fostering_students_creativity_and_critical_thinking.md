> Title of the innovation

Konmatea Institute of Technology and Arts Fostering Students Creativity and Critical thinking

> Brief description of the innovation

Education in Zambia kills Creativity in Students. Most students by the time they complete grade 12 they would have been left with no any creativity in them. That's why we have alot of youths in the street doing nothing. My institute will address this challenge and make sure creativity is maintained in children from the young stage to adults. Students will never lose their creative powers as we will maintain that.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

All students attending our classes will be charged a fee which will help to pay my staffs and attend to other expenses. This business will also help other businesses in the sense that these students we will be training will be assets not only in education sector but other industries such as Media, health, technology and research. With there creative minds they will be able to contribute positively to other sectors. For the start I will start with children of ages 12 and below as they have alot of creativity in them. The challenge prize will help me with my statup cost as I already have clients whom I was teaching children online coding. This project will massively contribute to environmental awareness to both students and the public by way of providing research to the public.

> Technical Feasibility

First I will start with an after school program. My centre will only be receiving learners who go to different schools. We will be using a pickup van to pick students from various schools so that parents during pickup time just picks there children to our centre. We will have 5 classes:
Science Class for children who wants to be Scientists.
Mathematics for students who wants to be Mathematicians
Technology class for tech savvy kids
Story writers, animators, artist in one class. 
Song composers, dancers in one class.
Hence I will start with 5 members of staff
Science Teacher with a bachelor's degree
Mathematics teacher with a bachelor's degree
IT teacher with a bachelor's degree
Music teacher with a diploma
I will be teaching students in animation, story telling, and art with a helper.
If funds Will be ready I intend to start the program in January 2022.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This is what Zambia needs. We have seen alot of students in the street just waiting for the government to be given jobs. Our youths the moment they complete grade 12 and if they didn't do better at grade 12 they end up in the street. Now if these students are taught a skill from young coupled with creativity they will be able to come up with tangible products in our country. Areas of art, animation, screenplay writing are still lagging behind. We have no scientists that's why up to now we depend on foreign countries to come up with vaccines and guide us on how we should lead our lives  So if we train these children in these areas they will be able to contribute positively to society. This will reduce crimes in our country as students will have something to do.
