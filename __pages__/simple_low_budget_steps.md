> Description of the solution

At an individual level, people can keep their homes cooler by taking simple, low-budget steps, like using foam tape to seal gaps around doors, or making larger renovations, like installing insulation. At community level neighbors can check in on one another, paying particular attention to the elderly or those who might not have as many social levels.
