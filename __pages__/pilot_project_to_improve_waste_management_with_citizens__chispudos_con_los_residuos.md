A pilot project for waste classification was carried out in collaboration with the municipality of Guatemala. The objective was that more than 100 homes in zone 5 began to classify their waste into "organic" and "inorganic", trying to make it a coordinated work between neighbors, municipality and collectors.  
The Project sought to support compliance with government agreement 164-2021, through the classification of waste from home.
