## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



KAFUKA Renewable Energy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Challenge: To develop innovative and sustainable lighting energy solutions adapted to the specific needs and circumstances of low-income communities and families in Cape Verde (mostly headed by women, and girls). 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Cape Verde, vulnerable communities face significant challenges in accessing reliable and affordable energy services, hindering economic development, social progress, and environmental sustainability. Traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are expensive, polluting and often unreliable, especially in remote areas. Addressing this energy access gap is key to improving livelihoods, promoting inclusive growth and mitigating the effects of climate change.

The Accelerator Lab, the University of Cabo Verde and local stakeholders to design and implement innovative, context-specific interventions that promote energy access, environmental sustainability and social inclusion.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab brings several added values and unique value propositions to the challenge of developing sustainable and inclusive lighting energy solutions for underserved communities and families: 

 Innovation and experimentation: The Accelerator Lab is focused on fostering innovation and experimentation to address complex development challenges. It can leverage cutting-edge technologies, methodologies and approaches to design and implement novel solutions tailored to the specific context of the Kafuka Renewable Energy

project.

Systems thinking: The Accelerator Lab adopts a system thinking approach, which allows it to understand the interconnectedness of different factors that influence energy access in low-income families, including socio-economic, environmental and technological aspects. This holistic perspective enables the Lab to develop comprehensive and integrated solutions that address root causes and leverage synergies across sectors.

Local engagement and co-creation: The Accelerator Lab emphasizes local engagement and co-creation, working

closely with underserved communities, local stakeholders and partners to understand their needs, aspirations and priorities. By involving local actors in the design and implementation of energy solutions, the Lab ensures that

interventions are contextually relevant, culturally appropriate, and sustainable over time.

Partnership facilitation: The Accelerator Lab facilitates partnerships and collaboration between different stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, academic institutions and private sector actors, to leverage complementary strengths, resources and expertise in addressing energy access challenges. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we effectively design and implement sustainable lighting energy solutions that are inclusive, affordable and tailored to the specific needs and contexts of underserved communities and low-income families?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will use a combination of methods and tools to gather relevant information, analyze data and generate insights. These methods and tools include:1. Surveys and interviews; field visits and observations; stakeholder workshops; literature reviews; data analysis; scenario planning; participatory mapping; monitoring and evaluation.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These new sources of data and information add value by providing a comprehensive understanding of energy access challenges in Cabo Verde, incorporating community perspectives, identifying appropriate technologies, fostering collaboration, and enabling evidence-based decision-making. Addressing existing data and knowledge gaps will enable us to develop more targeted, context-specific and impactful interventions to improve energy access and promote sustainable development in underserved communities and low-income families.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



During the growth phase of this challenge, several stakeholders could benefit from our work and contribute to its expansion and success: 

Local communities: Underserved communities, and low-income families would be the primary beneficiaries of

sustainable and inclusive lighting energy solutions. They would benefit from improved energy access, reduced energy costs, enhanced livelihood opportunities and improved quality of life.

Government agencies: Collaboration with government agencies, such as the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Rural Development, would be critical for scaling up energy solutions and integrating them into national policies and programmes. These agencies could provide support in terms of financing, regulatory frameworks and infrastructure development.

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs): NGOs working in the areas of rural development, environmental protection and social justice could play a key role in implementing and scaling up energy solutions, using their expertise, networks and resources to reach underserved communities and advocate for their needs.

Academic and research institutions: Collaboration with academic and research institutions, including the University of Cabo Verde, could facilitate knowledge sharing, capacity building and innovation in sustainable energy development. These institutions could provide technical expertise, research support and opportunities for student involvement in energy projects.

Private sector: Engagement with private sector actors, such as renewable energy companies, technology providers and financial institutions, could unlock opportunities for investment, innovation, and market development in the energy sector. Partnerships with the private sector could accelerate the deployment of energy solutions and stimulate economic growth in rural areas.

International development partners: Working with international development partners, including multilateral organizations, bilateral donors, and development banks, could provide access to funding, technical assistance, and best practices in sustainable energy development. These partnerships could support project implementation and help scale up successful interventions.

Community leaders and champions: Identifying and working with community leaders, local entrepreneurs, and champions of sustainable development in underserved communities would be essential to build trust, mobilize support and ensure community ownership of energy projects. These individuals could advocate for the needs of their communities and play a key role in project implementation and sustainability.
