> Brief description of the innovation

In 2019, approximately 53.6 million tons (Mt) of e-waste (excluding PV panels) was generated. It is estimated that the amount of e-waste generated will exceed 74Mt in 2030 (Global E-waste monitor.2020). Our Startup creates value for e-waste. We Recycle E-waste in a planet friendly manner Solving the e-waste problem.. 
Problems to be solved. 
 Reduce the huge land space that Primary mining does that should be left as forest reserves. 
 Avoid the careless disposal of e-waste in our communities. 
 Help reduce Government Expenditure on e-waste management. 
 Conserve our Mineral reserves for future supply. 
 Reduce diseases associated to e-waste and Lead poisoning. 
 Reduction of 1.3 Million tons of carbon dioxide emitted from the making of electronic devices from raw material. 
 Minimize damage to the environment. For example in an African gold mine you need two tons of rock to extract 1 gram of gold whilst you only need about five waste computers to get the same amount. 
 Conserve substantial amounts of energy that is used in Traditional mining. That means more gain for the Environment.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Recycling is a key industry for the way to a resource efficient circular economy. This innovation is a secondary form of Mining which after commercialization will benefit the economy and individuals in the following ways. 
 Commercialization will create direct and indirect jobs for workers at the plant and the scrap venders that will collect electronic waste from the communities and landfills. 
 This Form of gold mining will represent large savings since the cost of production is far less than primary mining hence, more profit resulting in more Tax revenue for the Zambian Government. 
 According to United Nations University, Mining gold from descended electronics yields 40-50 times more than raw gold mining. This will significantly increase capacity to Zambia’s Foreign exchange, turning in millions of dollars but with sustainability at the core. 
 This innovation will also bring about the growth of the Zambian Jewelry industry becomes of the affordable local gold supply. More Jobs. 
 The Exportation of electronic waste that remains after gold extraction to be further recycled will also source income. 
 With this innovation we will also support similar innovation among young people giving opportunity to the starting up of more local industries or improving of systems.

> Technical Feasibility

Electronic waste is collected/bought from communities, Companies and those that fix electronics, then it is broken down into the different components  which are Metal, Plastic and Glass. Since Our Startup currently focuses on Precious metals. the metal components which are plated with precious metals are processed through Chemical and physical processes to recover the precious metals as Gold. then the other components are to be sold to companies that recycle the respective materials being plastic and Glass.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will be very inclusive, from the workers at that will work at our E-waste plant, to scrap venders and communities. Resulting in proper 
disposal of E-waste and more opportunities as;
 Employment opportunities for the scrap vendors.
 All those directly or indirectly involved in the E-waste recycling procedure will have a sense of belonging to Environmental agents. 
 More appreciation for ICT as less danger will be imposed by it when its descended.
 It will contribute to enhancing the Right to Life Under article 6 of the ICCPR. As the innovation fights the threats that e-waste poses to right to life. 
 Article 12 of CESR calls for highest attainable health which the innovation will work towards by reducing all threats to human health. 
 Help propel Zambia to achieve a circular economy.
