> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Online learning is the now thing! Our Target market of this e-learning Platform are, ution centers, private schools, freelance tutors, teachers. The potential offtakers will have to subscribe to Par Excellence Tutorials(the company owning the system) by paying a charge and be able to use the platform. This platform will assist also those tutors who have the zeal to offload their knowledge but has not platform. As at now when the government closes schools, learning stops which is wrong because people graduate half-baked which is hazardous to the society.As these offtakers will have successful way of delivering to the pupils etc, they will have great recommendation. The prize will help the bussiness grow by helping in Database Management, purchasing equipments such as laptops, Branding, running advertisement, buying storage. Spreading knowledge and making this same knowledge accessible to others is the value added to the environment

> Technical Feasibility

The Consolidated School Management System is an upgrade of the Par Excellence Tutorials website, a company that offers tutorials services to local and international students. It has been designed in a way that students will be accessing online sessions right from the consolidated School Management System. This platform has an zoom integrated software, digital attendance monitoring(for both teachers/tutors/lectures and pupils/students).

> Anticipated Social Impact

Learning and a method of learning in periods of Covid-19 pandemic has been a choking problem. The society has half-baked graduates because of closures, schools in the name of online learning just bombard students with the notes through WhatsApp groups, and that's not a way of delivering services. In periods of closures pupils and students engange themselves in bad vices because they don't have what to do. However, Par Excellence Tutorials through it's consolidated school management platform wants to build the bridge for the gap in the education sector. As generations are changing there's need to revolutionarise into technoprenuership. Tutors and teachers will have a platform where they can deliver their work hence earning thereby improving their lives. Students and pupils will be able to finishes their syllabi.
