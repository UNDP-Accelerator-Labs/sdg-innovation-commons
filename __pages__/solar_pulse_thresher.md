> Description of innovation

Grassroot innovator Dipankar Das has developed a device for efficiently threshing matured pulses and grains such as green gram, black gram, arhar and horse gram, without using electricity or fossil fuels.

His creation of a solar thresher is expected to help Indian farmers save time on threshing and use the wastage as bio- manure in the field.
