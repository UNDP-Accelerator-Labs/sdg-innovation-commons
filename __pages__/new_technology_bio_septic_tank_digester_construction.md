> Title of the innovation

New technology Bio-Septic tank digester construction

> Brief description of the innovation

We're able to construct a Bio-Septic tanks which are environmental friendly and take less space compared to ordinary Septic Tanks. Water from Bio Digester can be taken through filtration unit drained into an underground storage tank, pumped out to a tank high above the ground, chlorinated and flows back into the house to be reused for flushing toilets and watering flowers.
This helps to reserve water resource.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will help generate incomes by participating in private and public construction sectors.
•Our target markets are government projects both residential and commercial, even in private sector. The challenge price will enable our business to grow by reinvesting in the required machines and tools for use in much complicated or complex projects ahead of us.
•The value addition of our innovation on the environment is that, they're environmental friendly, human solid waste are processed into water and methene. Water can further be reprocessed by filtration for reuse in gardening, flushing toilets and even for washing.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation are designed in a flexible way as a result of varying number of users determining the size of Bio Digesters ranging from 35 to more than 200 continuous users of toilet. 
The structure is filled with water and bacteria added into the water. This bacteria promotes the spontaneous reproduction inside the tank which acts as a catalyst to speed the rate of degradation process of solid waste into water and methene gas. Any bio degradable material that gets into the bio septic tank is dissolved and resultant water is channeled out through a pipe and drained into the ground.
•Our proposed implementation plan requires funds/capital to buy ready materials required for projects and more projects to drive this course to success.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our expected social impact is job recreation and preventing degradation of our environment.
