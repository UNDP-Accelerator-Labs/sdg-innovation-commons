> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation will be up-cycling plastic into building and pavers. Using Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET or PETE or Polyester), High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and some types of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) we will produce paving stones and building blocks 40% stronger than concrete blocks.
We will engage local governments, waste management companies and industries on the disposal of such types of plastics as the ones above which we will be using.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will get our blocks certified by the Zambia Bureau of Standards after which we will be able to sell to local building companies and customers. Our raw materials are very cheap as others which will significantly reduce our cost of production transferring the cost to customers which will be lower by 25-30% compared to the concrete blocks currently on the market.
We will also buy used plastics in the above classifications from local people who we will engage thereby they will make money through supplying the plastic materials to us.
transporters will also be engaged in transporting sand and finished products to customers.
Last but not least we will provide employment for the youths whole will earn a living also.

> Technical Feasibility

Plastic will be used as bonding agent for making blocks and paving stones this is an improvement of similar products by other actors.
We will use four types of plastics at specified ratios to sand. this will be done in a number of steps in summary as follows;
the plastics will be melted on wood fire at 500 degree Celsius after which sieved and cleaned sand will be added and mixed at specified ratios. The mixture will then be poured into oiled block molds and dried.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our product will be 25-30% cheaper and 7-10 times stronger than the concrete blocks that are currently on the market. it will provide employment.
we will rid the streets of plastic which has proven very difficult to dispose of and relieve the environment from the toxic effects that come with the used plastic.  In addiction to the disposal of plastic we will also use used engine oil.
Our innovation will have numerous benefits on the market.
