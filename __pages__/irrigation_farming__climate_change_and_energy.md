> Brief description of the innovation

We are into support of winter and irrigation farming,promoting and sensitising communities about Climate change and energy. We promote afforestation, value additional to our crops  on the market. Our aim is to make sure that youths and women are fully participating so as to reduce illegal poaching, prostitution and zero hunger by 2026.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The population  is growing rapidly in our district, therefore ,there is high demand in variety of food. By growing and supply on the market we will be making a lot money for the family, it will be the source of employment creation which will also boost the living standards of others when they paid their wages. There will  be a higher competition at the market which  helps levelling prices as to compared where is monopoly of prices because of low supply  and high demand.
We are embracing afforestation, using of inorganic fertiliser and practice arable agricultural farming method. We introduce a revolving funds amongest women, youths and differently abled persons. This will promote self-reliance.

> Technical Feasibility

We are using fallow type irrigation as our prototype. The water is drawn-out from the main stream and during use it's channelled through back into the main stream. When all  the water activities  are done ✔the  fallow is  completely closed until such a time when it's needed again.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Very relevant because business men and women have taken advantage  of the coronations pandemic and hiked prices of all the machedise in the name COVID-19 and dollar 💵 to kwacha  high exchange rate. This one will  use a different approach of involving and participating  of youths  and women  from different communities in the said mpulungu District. We be networking with  the local authority and agriculture department.
