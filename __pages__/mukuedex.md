> Title of the innovation

MukuEdex

> Brief description of the innovation

MukuEdex is an academic-platform bridging the gap between elementary and high schools lopsided toward teaching-staff equipped with diploma academic qualifications and those staffed with Undergraduate, Masters and PhD 
 degree academic qualifications to match the scenario in the developed world, thereby revolutionizing academia in emerging and new frontier markets. Students will post a job (based on the topic/subject their teacher lacked proper delivery skills in) on the platform, outlining their topic/subject in question as well as budget restrictions, and qualified staff from across the globe shall bid on the job, while noting the student’s syllabus posted on the latter’s profile. The platform 
 provides performance review and rating components on both sides of the isle, vis-à-vis teaching staff and students. The platform also provides a multiplicity of languages, including local and English, where-from a student could pick 
 their language of preference only for concept-introduction purposes by the teacher for the sole purpose of them gaining a real feel or gauge of the instructor’s capability on the subject matter.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The platform will make a commission on the bid-payments made by students to the hired instructors. The platform will also charge commissions on the study materials purchased by students from instructors. The primary target market are students needing private, but qualified tutors to help them understand topics they may not have understood clearly in class. The challenge prize shall help with further software development of the project. The project shall help schools graduate more university-material student as a value addition to the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The platform has a provision for students to post a job, outlining their topic/ subject in question as well as budget restrictions, and qualified staff from across the globe shall bid on the job. Student’s will be able to post their syllabuses as part of their own profile. The platform provides performance review and rating components for teaching staff and students. The platform also provides a multiple languages. The platform, further, provides moderation and instructional tools through a video/ audio/ text conference chat component. The system also provides an automated dynamic search and matching tool for the local-syllabus upload matching the syllabuses for the various schools around the new geographical area the student relocates to, whether that be abroad, regional or local. The student could then re-customize their profile with the appropriate syllabuses as applies to their new curriculum. The system shall also provide teaching-related and quality-monitoring and control tools. 

The company's go-to-market strategy includes radio, television, tech magazines, and the inbuilt virality features.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Zambia teaching labor market is saturated with qualified but unemployed teacher-graduates, with the system taking at the minimum of 3 years before it can absolved them. Teachers will therefore be able to sign up on the platform and work from the comfort of their homes using their own computers and smart phones and be paid through the system's integrated e-wallet. The platform will therefore help alleviate the unemployment issue the country is currently experiencing.
