> Description

http://reclama.bo/ offers legal assistance to women suffering from economic violence by addressing their demands for family assistance and labor rights. The business model used is the shared risk "No Win - No Pay," where legal fees are only charged when the case is won and there is a cash flow that allows for payment. Beneficiary women gain a deeper understanding of their legal rights in cases of economic violence and labor rights. They also develop skills to effectively file family assistance claims and labor grievances.

As a result, the beneficiary women experience an improvement in their well-being by obtaining justice and compensation for the economic violence suffered and violations of their labor rights. This enables them to recover emotionally and financially, contributing to the reduction of gender inequality and improving the quality of life for their families
