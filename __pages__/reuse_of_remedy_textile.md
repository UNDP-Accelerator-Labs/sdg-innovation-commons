Name of solution owner: Cecil Sagawala from Dar es salaam, Tanzania.

Cecil engages youths in collecting useless clothes and small pieces of textiles from tailor shops and homes and design different products like bags, rugs, decorations, covers, jackets, chairs, shoes, and many others which are eco-friendly. In this way, they contribute to protecting the environment from being polluted by textile wastes and generate employment opportunities for youths in the country.
