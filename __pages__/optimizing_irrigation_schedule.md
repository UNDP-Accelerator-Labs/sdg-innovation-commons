IoT based solution to optimize irrigation scheduling in agriculture. 


The designed system will distribute water among users equally based on the information received from sensors in the area, the vegetation, and other factors specified by the user.  Besides, information on water availability in the soil can be sent to the agencies in charge of the water distribution. In the future, if the water is delivered to agricultural areas through specific pipes then irrigation can be partially or fully automated with the sensor network and algorithm.
