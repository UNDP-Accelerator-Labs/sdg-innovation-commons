> Title of the innovation

Zambian Farmers Directory (ZAMFAD)- An app that directs you to an agricultural product or service by means of an active contact number and location

> Brief description of the innovation

The app is an agricultural mobile application that gives you contact details, addresses, real time location and brief description of a product or service that one is looking for. The person will type in the service or product that they require and the app will then bring all the active contacts and real time location in the area with basic information of the services they offer. The individual will then choose to contact them or visit them at their location. Also if a farmer has a product like broiler chickens for sale, he can subscribe to the app for that period of sale in which his contact details will be included in the directory and once a customer searches for broiler chickens, that contact number among other contacts that have subscribed will come up.
The reason for this innovation is to ease the accessibility of these products and services and also to make market readily available.
The Zambian economy is slowly diversifying into the agriculture sector and as we want to make this country the regional hub of agriculture, we need to find a smart solution to problems of marketing, product and service delivery.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Customers who will be agro-shop owners, farmers and agricultural specialists such as veterinarians and agronomists will subscribe to the app for their contact details to be included in the online directory, this will start from a monthly to annual subscription. For those farmers with quick to sale products such as chickens, milk or tomatoes, they will have to pay for a short term subscription of 1 week to 30 days special package. The app will be free for all users that want to visit the site or search for a product or a service. We are currently collecting contact numbers of potential customers through social media platforms such as Facebook whom we will invite by calling and give them a free 3 months subscription just for us to have enough contacts in our directory, subsidized by the prize money if awarded.

> Technical Feasibility

The mobile app is built using android studio leveraging on the Android Software development kit. The Android app is built using Java and uses a Firebase backend. The prototype has implementation of Notifications, Direct service provider dialing and a custom map showing nearby service providers. Customization of the web app is done by our team. An administrative panel will be built to manage, and monitor app performance, adding new services provider. Firebase crashlytics and analytics have been integrated to monitor user engagement. Google Maps for Android API has been integrated from the Cloud console which is the sole mapping provider for the app.

> Anticipated Social Impact

15.	This app will have a positive economic and social impact as it will improve the flow of business in the agricultural sector, it will also reduce on customer-seller physical contact especially in periods such as these of covid-19 restrictions. The app will also help farmers sell products especially perishables such as milk and tomatoes quicker thus reducing the stress and headaches of finding customers because if you’re registered on ZAMFAD, you won’t have to look for customers, customers will find you.
