## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

* Design Thinking showed to be a successful tool to improve public service delivery. The remodulation of the space changed the perception of the staff and users in different ways: - Users feel safer in relation to Covid measures after remodulation  - The queue system is perceived as more effective after the remodulation - The space is perceived as cleaner and better maintained after the remodulation - The space is perceived as more attractive and comfortable after remodulation - The space is perceived as more secure after remodulation - There is still work to be done to improve the relationship between staff and users and the way that services is delivered inside the Notary

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Design Thinking as a powerful tool to improve public service delivery (undp.org)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- Bureaucratic bottlenecks in the Ministry of Justice and UNDP, slowed down the process - Internal resistance of staff to use new technologies (ex. new digital queue system)

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Observation – was used to create an understanding of the behavior of the citizens, what aspects could be improved of the physical space and how the remodulation changed the way users and staff interacted with the space. Focus groups - to understand better what were the main issues inside the notary, and to look at the different views of users and staff without the groups influencing each other Direct Interviews- was used to understand citizens perception towards service delivery and well being, before and after remodulation Collective Intelligence - used to understand the challenges faced in the Ministry of Justice as well as exploring possible solutions Design Thinking - supported us in creating a user centered process to understand the challenges, possible solutions and allow for iteration and prototyping Prototyping - allowed us to explore how a quick and relatively cheap remodulation could have an impact on staff and users.  Surveys - was used to have a deeper understanding of staff and users.  All the methods addresses the lack of data in the beginning of this cycle, and the need to produce more data deriving from the citizens themselves.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Participatory Design, Design Thinking, Collective Intelligence and Co-Creation was  used to structure the process and generate insights about the challenges faced as well as possible solutions in relation to the physical space in the Notary in the Ministry of Justice in Bissau.  Behavioural Insights were used to measure the impact of the tested solution " the remodulation of the Notary". The value that these methods added to our learning question is that we were able to delve deeper into the challenge, better understand the complexities as well as designing tests that can generate learning about different aspects of the challenge.

Lusófona Student Association, 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

High Comission for Covid 19

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Dispatchers Association and Lusófona Student Association.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Through working directly with the Ministry of Justice, we were able to hold impromptu workshops with stakeholders, that along with a behavioral study, gave us insights into local and cultural dilemmas such as bottlenecks standing in the way for successful public service delivery. Additionally, working with the Governance Cluster, allowed us to tap into their expertise and previous knowledge of how to interact with local partners and facilitate collaboration.
