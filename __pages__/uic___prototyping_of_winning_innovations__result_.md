## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1)    For Smart City: for the development of a comprehensive web-based platform for disaster mitigation requires extensive data (disaster, socioeconomic, post-recovery needs, potential CSRs and relevant stakeholders, among others). Leveraging multiple data points and indicators gained from this pilot project enabled the CEGAS team to develop a vulnerability mapping, to assess community’s susceptibility level for disasters. This, in turn, could provide key insights for future interventions, alongside other innovative features that connect post-disaster & recovery needs with database of volunteers and CSR funding. 2)    For MSME Digitalization: while the social enterprise managed to implement all its social impact targets, the challenge lies in testing out a viable business model to sustain operations. Thus, it was necessary to acquire expertise and increase the team size to conduct rigorous market research to determine value proposition and go-to-market strategy. The social impact delivered surpasses the initial plans, which included urban and fish farming initiatives, and capacity buildings for communities. 3)    For Waste Management: It was extremely challenging for the team to develop the intended a food loss and waste management ecosystem within traditional market. Issues such as social inequality and reluctance from street food vendors required the team to pivot their plans and reflect – which delayed the timeline and progress project tremendously. From an initial physical food bank development, the team manoeuvred a back up plan of ‘digital’ food bank with the support of faith-based organization in the nearby mosques. While the idea has merit and the data collection process indicated that there is a significant amount of food loss and waste processed by the six-month pilot project, no concrete conclusion can be drawn yet due to the limited time of implementation that was cut short due to the project re-design process. 4)    From all three winners, implementation of gender equality – both in team structures and program design for beneficiaries – still requires improvement. Strong cultural context and understanding resulted in biased achievement of ‘gender equality’ where women empowerment still falls victim to conforming traditional gender roles. While all three grassroot winners have attempted to implement change in this regards, more support is needed from UNDP to disrupt existing program design and instil impactful change. 5)    In addition, UNDP needed to support these grassroot communities heavily in pushing the agenda of innovation and data collection process. There is lack of ability for both, which was essential to document learning progress, best practices, monitoring and evaluation and rooms for improvement.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

It was extremely difficult for one of the winners, FOKKALIS, to carry out their ambitious program design for food loss and waste management in traditional markets. While the intentions are to disrupt the existing practice of waste management - in which lack of organic waste processing remains a massive issue - more thought and meticulous planning was needed to ensure that the idea was feasible for implementation. Another issue with the MSME digitalization winner, Sayur Sleman, was on balancing profit generation with social impact. Despite capacity building efforts and sound research, the social enterprise was unable to showcase indication of financial & operational sustainability beyond the innovation grant. This poses further questions on whether the social enterprise will still be able to deliver impact should the pilot project period is over.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

CEGAS: In the targeted region of Slawi, Central Java, there is yet data on disaster. Throughout the pilot project, the team leveraged their expertise to use geospatial data as a basis for the web-based portal, while initiating new stakeholder engagement with the regional agency for disaster management. FOKKALIS: In the traditional market of Kramat Jati, there is no existing organic was management system. Thus, the team attempted to develop a systems maps that identifies flow of food waste and loss from vendors to the end collection point in markets to determine gaps and opportunities for a new design. Sayur Sleman: Building upon their existing social enterprise, the team initiated a background research that collected socioeconomic data of the beneficiaries (fruit and vegetable vendors) as well as users of the service (young urban population). In addition, they conducted customer satisfaction surveys pre- and post-intervention to capture sentiment from users as well as identify areas for improvement in their services.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The winning solutions from the Urban Innovation Challenge process were later developed and co-created with grassroot communities, where they designed proof of concept and implemented prototyping to test their hypotheses and assumptions. To ensure that the solutions fit the root causes, UNDP AccLab built their capacities on ethnography and immersion with local communities and potential beneficiaries. One of the winning solutions also focused on the development of web-based disaster portal that contributes to Smart Cities
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

FOKKALIS is one of the winning grassroot communities from the Urban Innovation Challenge - their role throughout the piloting phase is to design an ecosystem for food loss and waste management in traditional markets, in which they explored the opportunity of digital foodbanks and partnerships with faith-based organizations, food vendors, and government stakeholders.

 

 

Sayur Sleman is one of the winning grassroot communities from the Urban Innovation Challenge - their role throughout the piloting phase is to enhanced their social enterprise by developing elements of digitalization (such as websites) and conduct necessary research to support their market strategy. They are connecting vegetable and fruit vendors in traditional markets with new technology-led market in urban areas to alleviate economic burden due to COVID-19.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

CEGAS Studio is one of the winning grassroot communities from the Urban Innovation Challenge - their role throughout the piloting phase is to develop a web-based disaster portal and prototype its functions, while initiating partnerships with relevant government partners, volunteers, banks and private sector partners to ensure its sustainability.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ecoxyztem is a Venture Builder that serves as a co-partner throughout the Innovation Challenge organization as well as piloting of winners. Their main role throughout the prototyping phase is to conduct frequent monitoring and evaluation as well as provide required capacity building for grassroot communities.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The three winning communities were new and unusual because they are at a grassroot level, some even initially didn't possess a legal entity, which is currently a one of a kind partnership with small scale entities within UNDP. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The simultaneous exploration towards multiple sector within the urban resilience focus (smart city, MSME & Digitalization, waste management) enabled the team to explore various data sources - such as geospatial data, socioeconomic data, customer satisfaction surveys, systems maps and stakeholder engagement that bring about insights on a broader perspective of the complex system (which if any of these singular data point were analyzed in isolation, would not have been able to achieve the interconnected insights). Proof of concept and prototyping methods were central throughout this pilot project, where grassroot communities co-created the solutions with their beneficiaries using tools such as ethnography. This ensures that the problem-solution fit is safe guarded and the impact delivered is effective.
