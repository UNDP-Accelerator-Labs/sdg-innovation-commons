## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Building systems resilience against disaster through futures literacy and inclusive digital innovation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that current linear efforts on disaster reduction are unsuitable to tackle complexities of future disasters due to lack of long-term planning and digital innovation.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Indonesia is highly vulnerable to disasters, especially considering its location within the Ring of Fire and the fact the country lays on a meeting point for several active tectonic plates. Still, the infrastructure for disaster mitigation is poor. According to Lokadata.id, based on data provided by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), only one out of every 15 villages in Indonesia has an early warning system for disasters. This situation has not been improved yet due to a lack of funding. Without an adequate disaster mitigation framework, Indonesia’s 270 million residents are at risk.  In order to address this, we can build the resilience of these systems through future literacy. Future literacy gives people a better understanding of the role of the future in what they see and do, and allows them to use it to enhance their ability to plan and respond to change.

In the latest survey conducted by Accelerator Lab that aspires to identify emerging trends toward the future of Indonesian cities participated by more than 500 people, the dominant trends on environment sector are uncertain weathers, frequent disasters, and increasing temperature on earth.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

To bring about long-term planning and inclusive digital innovation within the disaster  risk reduction (DRR) sector, the Accelerator Lab Indonesia initiated the ‘Futures Thinking in DRR’, a series of webinars, expert lectures and virtual groups discussions, and will support the Reconstruction and Resilience Unit (RRU) within the CO on their DIRECT Project on planning and conducting a hackathon. In terms of the ‘Futures Thinking in DRR’, the Accelerator Lab Indonesia plays a key role as initiator of the project, emphasizing on the importance of bringing a new approach in disaster risk reduction. As a proponent of foresight and future studies, the Accelerator Lab Indonesia not only brings about this newly-introduced knowledge and skillset to the CO, but also to external partners. Contextualizing futures thinking into DRR could potentially propel other CO units and partners to diversify how they understand the issue and develop more transformative programs. Meanwhile, for the DIRECT Project, Accelerator Lab would give insights on applying Collective Intelligence into their project design. Accelerator Lab would ensure the co-creation method to be included along the project implementation. For instance, providing the democratic space for the impacted communities and grassroots innovators to have their say and/or being involved in the digital innovation design. This way, we could drive for the delivery of inclusive digital innovation in strengthening systems resilience against disaster.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

To strengthen the systems resilience, Accelerator Lab Indonesia is enabling futures thinking and inclusive digital innovation in disaster risk reduction. To mitigate complexities of upcoming disasters, capacity building is focused on youth & young professionals as future leaders.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

(i)  What are the existing practices in disaster risk reduction in Indonesia and  Southeast Asia? What are the innovation gaps that could be accommodated? (ii) What is the impact of future thinking in disaster risk reduction for youth and young professionals in mitigating uncertainties and complexities of future disasters? (iii) What are the potential values that Collective Intelligence could bring into the design of hackathons and other similar digital-driven projects?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation is at the center of the ‘Futures Thinking in DRR’ project, whereas the series of activities will be jointly developed and implemented by Accelerator Lab Indonesia, UNESCO RBAP and U-Inspire Alliance. The main objective behind the webinar, workshops and virtual group discussions is to enable knowledge and skill transfer on foresight through future analysis of upcoming natural hazards and disasters. Systems thinking will be integrated throughout the content and curriculum design to propel participants in taking a holistic approach in planning future programs related to DRR and deliver transformative change. Meanwhile, the DIRECT project will focus on planning and conducting hackathons, in which the Accelerator Lab Indonesia will support and embed values of collective intelligence to ensure a participatory and inclusive process and results.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

As part of the project planning and scoping, surveys will be implemented to identify DRR topics to be discussed in the webinar, workshops and group discussion activities. Meanwhile, for the foundation of content and curriculum design, a combination of widely available data from social media, open and citizen data as well as big and raw data will be analyzed and synthesized. The culmination of these different data sources will enable us to understand further on the existing DRR practices and innovation gaps. Pre- and post-event surveys will also be distributed to participants to gain information on the value of futures thinking and foresight as well as collective intelligence in inclusive digital innovation for DRR.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Focusing on youth and young professionals in Southeast Asia as future leaders, the ‘Futures Thinking in DRR’ aims to expand their horizon in understanding issues and seeking for solutions. The main objective of the series of activities is that participants will be able to integrate long-term and systems thinking into upcoming programs in DRR, to strengthen the resilience (not just aiming for quick wins and short-term coping mechanisms). UNESCO, U-Inspire Alliance and UNDRR will sustain the initiative after Accelerator Labs’ involvement, and transform its findings into a publication that will be presented during the Global Platform for DRR in 2022 in Bali, Indonesia. Meanwhile, the inclusive digital innovation in the DIRECT project will prioritize the involvement of youth and vulnerable groups, which could pave the way for a more inclusive digital-led activity in the long run for other CO units.
