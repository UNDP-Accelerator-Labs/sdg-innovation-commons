## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is how to create better projections and budget planification for the country with luck of correct data and proper infrastructures ? 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Guinean government, in its heightened commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, has initiated various endeavors. These include digitization, enhancing information systems, expanding fiber connectivity throughout the entire territory, among other initiatives. However, several challenges persist, notably in establishing and fortifying the statistical system, crucial for obtaining reliable and concrete data.

With this in mind, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) laboratory in Guinea seized a significant opportunity during the Global Data Forum in Hangzhou, China. The aim was to gather innovative solutions and crucial insights to guide efforts in facilitating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. With this wealth of new information, the UNDP, as a technical partner, aims to offer its expertise to further these shared objectives.

Among the actions already realized are the development of the National Digitization Strategy, the implementation of digitization in sectoral ministries such as Agriculture, the Ministry of Pre-University Education and Literacy, and others. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to mobilize both public and private partners.

Less than 30 good statisticians available in whole country of Guinea.

To propel Guinea towards sustainable development, establishing a genuine and lasting democracy is imperative. This requires transitioning from a phase of transition to a duly recognized and accepted regime by development partners. This entails instituting mechanisms such as organizing fair and democratic elections. However, Guinea's government faces a challenge due to the lack of reliable data regarding the general population census. To address this issue, the National Institute of Statistics is employing various means, notably field surveys.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



"One major advantage is that we visited China and witnessed the full scope and seriousness dedicated to this initiative. We gathered all the adaptable solutions for our country's context and, even more importantly, locally sourced solutions. We are precisely positioned to pivot, facilitating support in strengthening the organizational capacity of the NGO and ensuring the event's credibility with technical partners. Particularly, we aim to encourage private partners for collaboration, considering they already possess significant technical advantages compared to Guinea."



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



As part of UNDP's efforts to support the Guinean government in accelerating the implementation of its National Development Plan (PRI) towards achieving the 2030 Goals, and considering the challenges it faces regarding static data, robust infrastructure, etc., we are conducting this case study to foster convergence among stakeholders, encouraging the pooling and openness of data for a fairer Guinea.
