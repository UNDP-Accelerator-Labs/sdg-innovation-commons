> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How does tourist engagement with self-guided experiences, as observed in the open-air exhibition experiment "Reveal Madaba," contribute to promoting and preserving Madaba's intangible cultural heritage?

We created an open-air exhibition experiment, Reveal Madaba, showcasing Madaba’s intangible cultural heritage through sensory pieces and interactive elements. The experiment aimed to observe tourist engagement with self-guided experiences.

This exhibition will be accessible to all visitors through boxes installed in the public streets. Each box has a topic and tells a story of Madaba's cultural experience. We hope this exhibition will excite tourists to complete a self-guided tour around Madaba and encourage them to reach providers of these cultural experiences, leading to more time and money spent during their visit.

The experiment included observation, short random interviews, and long interviews used to collect data.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The first phase of this experiment will be implemented in five locations to collect feedback from tourists on this concept and enhance the touristic experience of Madaba's heritage trail. 

Shababuna Ezwieh, supported by the Accelerator Lab, has already coordinated with high-level officials to ensure their endorsement of the project and has collected feedback on elements such as location, branding, and content. The youth-led company has also worked with the Accelerator Lab to get approval from the Madaba municipality to install the exhibition boxes in public areas and with the Madaba Directorate of Tourism to place the first box in the Madaba visitor center.

Each outdoor box is designed to speak about an intangible element of Madaba's heritage,  a narrative to provide more information about the intangible heritage element, an interactive part such as touching a mosaic piece or using the mih-bash, and a rating device to give feedback on the experience. Tourists can read and touch the various elements and expand their knowledge by scanning a QR code that takes them to a website with videos and more information about the box's content.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the 'Reveal Madaba' open-air exhibition effectively showcases Madaba's cultural heritage through sensory and interactive elements, then tourists are more likely to engage with self-guided experiences. As a result, this increased engagement may lead to tourists independently exploring Madaba, potentially resulting in greater spending during their visit.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experiment will include observations, short random interviews, and long in-depth interviews used to collect data. The data will be collected over the period of  23 days.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

People interacting with the Open-Air Exhibition

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The experiment collected data through surveys, interviews, and observations of visitor actions to evaluate the extent to which visitors recognized and learned from the boxes and interactive experiences and how their overall experience influenced visitor engagement.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 Months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

10,000 USD
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The results are that the Reveal Madaba experiment was generally well-received by visitors and had a positive influence on their understanding and appreciation of Madaba culture.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The Reveal Madaba experiment has been a successful initiative in promoting Madaba heritage and engaging visitors through interactive experiences. The design, written content, QR content, and reading angle have all played an essential role in creating an immersive and educational experience for visitors. Additionally, the positive feedback from visitors, particularly for the Mih-bash experience, highlights the importance of engaging multiple senses in the interactive experiences. However, the results also indicate that the Madaba community and the durability of the boxes are acute factors that need to be well-thought-out in executing such experiments. The high damage rate of Box 4, for example, demonstrates the need for careful consideration of box placement and monitoring to ensure its durability and maintainability. Despite these challenges, the success of the Reveal Madaba experiment shows the potential for the broader execution of similar experiments in other heritage sites.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 Months in total

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

7,000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, we are developing the exhibition further with a professional product designer to support our partner (Shababuna Ezeih) create an even more immersive experience that is well sustained and can resist different damages. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We are currently exploring scaling this experiment to two cities in Jordan. (Municipalities along with our partner Shabuna Ezeih).

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity
