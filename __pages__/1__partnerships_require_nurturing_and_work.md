## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Partnerships require a lot of nurturing, time and work! 2. The incentives to partner in the context of innovation are not 'visible' not clear to individuals in key government institutions and hence cite real or 'imagined' bottlenecks such as bureaucracy and cumbersome systems. 3.People need to feel empowered to contribute to change and People continually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire. 4. Unfortunately, due to  lack of time dedicated to focus on the learning challenge, we were not able to  nurture the new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured and finally 5. the hypothesis of Peter Senge that Collective aspiration is set free and People are continually learning to see the whole together remains untested.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, the bottlenecks cited were lack of dedicated time, opportunity  as well as the strict safety requirements (UNDP) on social distancing and contact during the pandemic, which prevented us from going out to the community on field missions. For example, going out to the community became a challenge because we would be expected to undertake a (self-paid) COVID test before and after going out.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The purposive sampling  methods (exploratory)  emerged as we went along.  We were not able to do any AB testing or actually use behavioural insights without the policy makers being involved.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collaborating with the community and focusing on their needs rather than on the traditional top-down approach facilitates inclusive innovation itself. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the Khomas Regional Council and the Constituency Councillor

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Our partnership with NUST would have been ideal but they did not have the time to come to the meetings whcih we scheduled with the community.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None - our partnership with the SPAR group took too long (for the RBA partnership to give guidance on the private sector due-diligence) and the relationship unfortunately died a natural 'death'.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Office of the Prime Minister - Introduced inclusive innovation / Ministry of ICT  - made use of the Multi Purpose Community Centres/ Ministry of Home Affairs, Immigration, Safety and Security - hoped to connect it to an experiment on legal identity

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The community themselves - no explanation needed, as they are the beneficiaries.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Through a lot of frustration - we were able to see that initiatives on innovation need champions and owners in order for the process to be sustainable. People wish to see proof of concepts and to feel empowered.  We never got to realise this because of the politics and dynamics on incentivisation.
