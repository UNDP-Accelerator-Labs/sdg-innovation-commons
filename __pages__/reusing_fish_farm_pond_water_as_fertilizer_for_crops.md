## Solution holder: Kaseb Al Shakanbeh

Kaseb Al Shakanbeh from Dhiban, a small town in the governorate of Madaba in Jordan, owns and runs a fish farm and farm that grows vegetables and fruits and also has chicken and livestock. He has three fish ponds and 20% of the water in the fish ponds needs to be changed daily, which is 60 cubic meters per pond. Instead of throwing away the water, he is using it to water his crops. Since he now only uses this natural fertilizer and has stopped using hormones and other types of artificial fertilizers, the vegetables from his farm are now considered organic produce. He now has an increase in demand for his produce from vegetable shops and he is able to sell for double the price.
