> Title of the innovation

The Ngoma's Ranch.

> Brief description of the innovation

The Ngoma’s Ranch is supporting this motive, in form of the farming chain 
created. This will create continuous employment, as the farmers involved in this chain 
would have to hire personnel on their farms and the disabled will be able to participate 
in the economy. In addition, the economy will be strengthened as the ranch wishes to 
entice the government to purchase locally produced chicken cuts, which could 
possibly be exported around Africa as an estimated $377 million was spent by South Africa on importation of chicken cuts.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As the innovator, income will be earned and shared through the membership fees and the revenue earned after the sell of the product. 40% of the revenue is allocated to the farmer, another 40% to the farmers and the remaining 20% is invested back into the initiative to ensure that the venture continues to expand and cater for more citizens. Zambia's agricultural sector is one that beems of potential and could earn the country GDP hence the need for funding so as to also empower citizens to try and quickly bridge the inequality gap.

> Technical Feasibility

financing should be awarded to the ranch, as the 
business is not only creating income for itself but for communities at large and 
employment during the tough time of the pandemic as many have lost their jobs. 
Continuous creation of employment and creation of independence in terms of a source 
of income will have an adversely positive effect on the economy in forms of reduction 
of unemployment and create stable living standards for all involved, as this would be 
a way for them to be able to afford their basic needs.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The continuous cycle of employment will create a platform for even more citizens to be able to afford basic needs as they will now have a source of income.
