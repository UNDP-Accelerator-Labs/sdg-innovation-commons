Our technology SoWind (solar &amp; windmill combine) uses sun light and wind to power homes and small businesses in rural communities. We install this technology to provide cheap and affordable electricity for the less privilege citizens of Sierra Leone, the combination of the solar and windmill makes the systems more effective because it works during the day and night.
