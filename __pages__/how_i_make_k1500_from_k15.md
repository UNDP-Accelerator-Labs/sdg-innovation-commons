> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It has added a big alot of values at a community level as I alluded early that I only have two permanent workers on the other side during holidays i do give some peace work for grade 4- grade 7  I at least afford giving them the minimum of k60 per week others they just decide to go and pay their school fees which I do so as soon as they open. Therefore my business at least is managing to educate some of my community members most especially the venerable ones and orphans at large my air is to lift the standard of living in my district nchelenge.
