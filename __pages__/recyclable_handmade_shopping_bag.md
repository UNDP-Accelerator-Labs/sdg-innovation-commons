Innovator: Dalida J Borlasa from Ambae Island in Vanuatu

Narrative: Single-use plastic has been banned in Vanuatu, however, the alternatives still comprise other plastic types. Dalida Borlasa from Malekula Island, Vanuatu, created a recyclable shopping bag that consists of a plastic rice bag sewn on the outside, fabric on the inside and a fabric handle that is comfortable to carry on the shoulder. She explains that it is waterproof due to the plastic rice bag side facing out, and if turned inside out, it can be used to carry frozen meat, or wet clothes during a day out at the beach, and the fabric outside can be used for fashion. It is easy to wash, dry, it is cheap and easy to carry around and can be easily folded.
