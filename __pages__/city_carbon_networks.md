> Type of the Solution

Research

> Affected Sector

Improve Air Quality

> Description of the solution

The study on city carbon networks assesses how urban consumption impacts hinterland emissions and guides investment and trading strategies for carbon reduction. By mapping the flow of emissions between cities, it highlights how targeted carbon trading can enhance mitigation efforts and accelerate progress towards carbon neutrality. This approach aims to refine global and local strategies to reduce carbon emissions effectively.

> Socio-economic effects

Provides a deeper understanding of urban emissions, influencing policy for more effective climate action and promoting strategies that address both local and imported emissions.

> Type of Measure

- 2. policy/regulation measure

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- local government
- national government

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)
