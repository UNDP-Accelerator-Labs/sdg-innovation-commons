> Title of the innovation

Small Scale Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Organic Fertilizer Production Industry

> Brief description of the innovation

The Small Scale Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Organic Fertilizer Production Industry is an innovation whose core mission is production of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Organic fertilizers by using local organic waste and other local materials that will be fed into the mini-biogas plant that will be set-up. The innovation undertakes an integrated energy and agriculture components through optimal utilization of locally available resources that remain unused most of the times and are causing various challenges in communities and the country at large.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The energy demand and increase in prices of agricultural in-puts will enable this innovation to generate income from supply of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in cylinders and organic fertilizer which will be packaged in bags of 10 and 25 Kgs to local farmers in the community and country at large. Therefore, the prize for the challenge will be used start the project by procuring the needed equipment and setting up of the plant to start with CNG and fertilizer production.
The Small Scale Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Organic Fertilizer Production Industry will improve the operations of fast food industries like hungry lion and Nadia’s which use gas stoves for their meals and the operations of the agriculture business will improve through improved yields and a cheaper fertilizer source. All in all, it will improve the business environment through value-addition and supplying affordable energy and organic fertilizer sources.
This will be one of the sustainable industries in Zambia which is commercially viable and environmentally sensitive as it will reduce organic waste landfilling, reduction of emissions and will generate income and employment for local.

> Technical Feasibility

The Small Scale Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Organic Fertilizer Production Industry implementation will comprise securing of a 2-acre farmland in 10 miles, Lusaka. Then there will be construction of a mini-biogas plant which will have a bio-digester, biogas purifier and bio slurry collector and dryer. For sales and marketing an outlet will be set up for supply of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) cylinders and Organic Fertilizers bags. For the marketing and sales strategy to be effective networking used with a bottom up approach to engage farmers and residents and business operators.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The anticipated social impact of the innovation comprises among others improved local air quality, replacing traditional diesel or gasoline with CNG fuel can reduce pollutant emissions, resulting in local air quality benefits. Diversification of energy sources, improved agricultural yields, employment and income generation, GHG emission reduction, cheaper agricultural production, business efficiency and effectiveness and promotion of industrial growth overtime.
