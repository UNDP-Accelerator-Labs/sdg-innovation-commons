## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

In Eswatini, the cottage industry is experiencing growth. Nonetheless, local products often go unnoticed due to various factors, including competition from similar goods in the formal sector, lack of food safety certification for home-processed products, inadequate marketing, and limited recognition beyond local communities. Additionally, there’s a prevailing consumer preference for imported goods, a trend rooted in historical familiarity. Despite the quality of local offerings, inconsistent compliance with production and food quality standards can hinder their acceptance in formal markets and by consumers. Currently, numerous local micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) informally produce diverse products but face challenges in accessing formal market channels like retail stores and restaurants. This barrier hampers the growth of small businesses, leading to unsustainable operations, reduced job creation, and impeded economic development.

The learning objectives are to identify the barriers preventing local products from gaining a foothold in local markets and to determine the necessary support for these products to gain momentum in both domestic and regional markets. Additionally, it’s important to analyze the key elements contributing to the successful processing and marketing of locally made cayenne sauce. Moreover, recognizing policy deficiencies that could hinder the market entry of local agro-processed goods is crucial. This knowledge will serve as a valuable asset for the Country Office in crafting an Enterprise Supplier Development initiative within the Inclusive Growth portfolio.


> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a cottage informal enterprise in agro-processing is provided with supported with industrial processing equipment, processing facility and quality management training, then the business will be able to learn and implement formal business operations and access formal markets for growth.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test the hypothesis, the initial step involved partnering with the Home Economics Department of the Ministry of Agriculture to select a group of women skilled in agro-processing techniques like making peanut butter, sauces, and baking. This group consisted of 20 women from various communities in rural Shiselweni, who had organized themselves to produce cayenne sauce in one member’s cottage. Their products were sold locally to neighbors and in marketplaces.

A sensemaking session with the Home Economics team was conducted to comprehend their work’s extent and the women’s groups they supported in Shiselweni. The team disclosed that they assist 19 women’s groups in the region, and the chosen group was purposefully selected from these for their active production and sales. A focus group consultation was held  with group members to understand their background, collective vision for cayenne sauce production, and governance framework. The Acclab team, Home Economics Department, and SEDCO collaborated with the group to design an experiment to compile a basic framework/pathway of how a business can move from cottage informal enterprise to formal operations with access to larger markets. 

The experiment’s enabling factors and inputs included: a. Provision of formal processing facilities – transitioning from cottage-kitchen to an industrial setup, utilizing underused facilities at the Nhlangano Farmer Training Center owned by strategic partners in the Home Economics Department.  b. Formal business registration – a significant barrier for formal market acceptance by retailers. Registration aids in meeting other administrative compliance, such as traceability, tax registration, governance practices, and adhering to food and health safety standards, as well as marketing and advertising. c. Product development – involves learning about quality management systems, kitchen equipment, food production, reviewing and improving product recipes, and understanding branding, packaging, and barcoding. d. During the sensemaking and exploration phase, the group expressed a need for training in formal food processing and the implementation of food quality standards.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time allocation is 80% from the team to get things progressing, otherwise once the team moves away, there is little progress.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes it was proven. That technical capacitation alone is not enough to transform a business model from cottage enterprise to formality. A number of developmental activities, time to change and learn should be awarded to the beneficiaries. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Yes we have observations about the methodology. Here are the observations:

Behavioral insights - this was a social experiment where beneficiaries are observed to see if they will carry out agreed activities without external prompting. This helped the team to study intrinsic motivation and behavioral responses in a natural setting. This provided us with insights into how individuals or groups  act when they believe they are not being directly supervised or influenced. It was a way to understand the genuine willingness and commitment of participants to adhere to certain behaviors or tasks that they have agreed to undertake. We achieved valuable insights on the group dynamics, implementation of quality assurance training and the business operations. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

From design to activity it took 12 months.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

$12449,38

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Since this is a social experiment that needs a much longer observation period. The experiment did not have a 'next stage' plan' because the participants had several challenges in commitment, participation in activities, business administration and management during the experiment period. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes the experiment was initially planned to scale through the support of other development partners within the agro-processing ecosystem in Eswatini. However the team received no tangible support from the target partners.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

Based on the above observations the following learnings have been derived from the experiment ·      

1.     The approach of assembling large groups of people to establish income-generating ventures can be impractical, often resulting in conflicting group dynamics, priorities, and expectations that may compromise the intervention’s success. A case in point is a 19-member group that encountered numerous unresolved cohesion issues. For instance, they faced difficulties in adhering to production schedules, collaborating, and reaching consensus on shared activities. Consequently, only a few members ended up shouldering the bulk of the work to advance sales and other tasks. This is a recurring trend, where a number of community business initiatives have been reported to fail. This is attributed to a lack of commitment, subpar performance, and ineffective management of group dynamics, leading to waning interest and transparency deficits among members. Moreover, the sheer size of the business group often results in underperformance due to unfulfilled expectations, as the output volumes for many startups are typically insufficient to generate the anticipated profits and dividends.

2.      The individuals formed a Cooperative but were unable to collaboratively manage the business during the observation period. A Cooperative is a collective of individuals who come together willingly to fulfill their shared economic and social objectives through an enterprise that is collectively owned and democratically managed. The group did not succeed in following the Cooperative’s governance requirements such as creating a constitution independently. The learning here was that the team was not ready to formally be registered as a formal enterprise.

3.       The UNDP’s participation in the project inadvertently fostered a reliance among the group members. As the project progressed, the members’ expectations for assistance grew, including expectations for marketing and advertising the  products and ongoing financial support for operational costs like ingredients and packaging. The learning here was that hiring of a business development institution may have helped in running the experiment.

4.       Entrepreneurship and the growth of the private sector are recognized as potential solutions to economic challenges. However, it’s acknowledged that not everyone is equipped to manage a business. Consequently, development organizations should perform thorough assessments of business aptitude to gauge an individual’s suitability for entrepreneurial ventures. It’s essential to recognize that some individuals may thrive more as employees rather than as business owners or entrepreneurs. Imposing entrepreneurship on those not predisposed to it could jeopardize the success of the initiative.

5.     The experience revealed that formal retail channels demand stringent product compliance, necessitating significant investment to satisfy these standards. This requirement poses a substantial hurdle in transitioning to formality. Despite allocating resources to acquire the necessary tools, training for formal production methods, and labeling, the group found themselves in need of additional funding to confidently fulfill the requirements of formal markets. To secure the success of the business model, it’s essential to engage multiple partners for support. for exampled; The product (cayenne sauce) recipe was modified and had a few additional ingredients added to it. This also included changes in packaging and branding. While these improvements were good, it was  later on realized that the women’s group needed to change their target market because the price mark for the product also needed to be increased. This change was unanticipated by the group and it called that they either change back to the basic product recipe and only use the improved product recipe for high end clients.  

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The main obstacles faced during this activity was: 

Implementing Quality Management Training: The team members found it challenging to apply the principles from the quality management systems training to their everyday tasks.

Accessing Formal Markets: The team faced difficulties in securing entry into formal markets. An active marketing strategy was necessary for this endeavor. However, the lack of active involvement and support from the team members resulted in slow progress.

Securing a Permanent Production Facility: Securing a stable production location proved to be a hurdle for the team, primarily due to insufficient sales to cover operational expenses. The business’s financial losses made it difficult to demonstrate convincingly that the business could sustain itself in the foreseeable future.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacles was that the experiment happened during a politically volatile period in Eswatini. The beneficiaries were unable to travel to production site due to violence caused by the unrest.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP programme team, focusing on projects that empower women in rural areas.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government and other development partners particularly focused in local economy development projects in agro-processing.


> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes the experiment required a few iterations. 1. The Home economics facility period was initially 3 months. However due to some delays caused by ongoing covid 19 restrictions and the political unrest in Eswatini, the team had to ask for extended period of 1 year. 2. The experiment group group dynamics challenges called for a review in the business model that the group had initially decided to pursue. i.e. the Cooperative model is not ideal due to the differing ambitions of the group members. The majority members did not have business mangement acumen nor did they display interest in running  to have business ownership interests but rather are seeking livelihoods through the project. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

I would advice that person to: 1. Work with a small group. The 20 member group presents challenges in terms of meeting activity objectives. 2. find a research monitoring person that will support the Acclab in collecting data and compiling reports for the experiment. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. We would need to consider the location of the experiment, review support mechanisms for the beneficiaries.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The sense and explore phases of the learning cycle were brief and did influence running an experiment. I

> What surprised you?

There were no surprises.
