A two-pronged initiative that combines food technology innovation and social innovation. It is based on smoked “lumek” fish, predominantly found in the waters surrounding Bruit Island in Sarawak. The project provides the community of Bruit Island economic and social benefits while the innovators have also introduced a healthy, delicious and calcium-rich delicacy that is produced through innovative processing techniques, healthy cooking and modern packaging to preserve its freshness.
