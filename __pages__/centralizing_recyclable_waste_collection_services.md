Hai Chau 1, a ward in Hai Chau District - Central area of Da Nang, is the first location to pilot the City’s waste sorting strategy. The ward decided that it will promote waste sorting by centralizing the recyclable waste collection services. Two Danang Urban Environment Company (DUEC) workers are hired to go through all houses in the ward twice a week (Monday and Wednesday) and collect valuable waste from these households.

In order to be more friendly with citizens, DUEC renovated the normal trash collection trolley into new recycle collection trolley. They also recorded their “call for action” and play it while going through households to urge citizens to give valuable wastes.

After the valuable wastes are collected, DUEC staff will take them to the collection point and store them in appropriate sections before selling them out.
