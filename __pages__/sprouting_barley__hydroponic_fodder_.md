Increased prices of feed and the drought during  the past couple of years are pushing farmers to look for alternative feed. One of the alternative that is gaining the most interest is sprouted barley. Although sprouted fodder is not a new idea, but what is new is the way Syrian farmers are growing it using local available resources. Some are sprouting for self-sufficiency other farmers has turned it into business that generate a decent income. Farmers chose barley over other kind of sprouted seed to feed their livestock because it is high production rate (1 kg of seeds gives 7kg sprouted) and more importantly because nutritional benefits in barely are high than in other seeds.   How: Barley needs a controlled climate to sprout, some farmers are building rooms with special conditions to control climate and light. To sprout the barley, the first thing farmers do is soaking barely in water for 24 hours. Next, barley will be spread over trays and then trays will be put on racks for seven days and watered regularly.
