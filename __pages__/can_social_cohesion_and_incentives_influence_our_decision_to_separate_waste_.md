## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Nampaka Nkumbula

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

31/03/2021

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Waste Management

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

The problem we will be addressing is the reduction of waste going to the landfill by separating waste at source so that the only waste that ends up in the landfill are the non-recyclable waste. We hope to learn how behavioral interventions work to promote separation of waste at source

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

1. We want to learn what the communities KAP are towards waste management

2. We want to learn if information sessions can work to change KAP towards waste management

3. We want to learn if incentivized discounts on waste collection charges can get people to separate their waste at source

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We hope to learn what works in separation of waste at source in a community of Lilanda and what will motivate the people to separate the waste.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If households are offered a lower collection rate by CBEs, then households will separate their waste at source

If households are given information on the benefits of separating their waste at source, then they will separate their waste.

If households are offered a prize for the cleanest house, then there will be more households paying for waste collection

If households are linked to a plastic waste aggregator, then households will separate their waste at source to sell recyclable 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Survey

This survey was a household-based survey that targeted suitable respondents (16 years or older) within the households. The design of the study was a quasi-experimental simplified cross over design, with one sequence and 3 main data collection points being, baseline, midline and endline.

Geographical Area and Target Sample

Two areas were identified for the assessment i.e. Lilanda green and Desai in Kapwepwe Ward 25

 The parameters for the two communities were as follows;

Lilanda green has 10 streets with an average of 20 households on each street. Therefore, giving an estimated 200 households.

Desai community was estimated by the community to have about 2,000 households.

Given the estimated number of households in each community, a total of 400 households were randomly selected from both communities as follows:

100 households from Lilanda Green and,

300 households from Desai community

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

household

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Experimental: Pre- post, randomization at household level, simplified cross over (1 sequence); 3 data points: Baseline, After information, after incentives + linkage to aggregator

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

5 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

only 3 were proven, below;

If households are offered a lower collection rate by CBEs, then households will separate their waste at source

If households are given information on the benefits of separating their waste at source, then they will separate their waste.

If households are offered a prize for the cleanest house, then there will be more households paying for waste collection

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We used a pre-post- test; the number of observations did not allow for statistical inference over a 3-month period of implementation. I would use a different control group and allow for a longer period of observation. I would also consider introducing user journals for the CBEs to document their waste collection journeys. The experiment implementation and data collection was community led which helped in terms of enrolling households unto the experiment, but it also interfered with participation of some community households due to local leadership political influence.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

8 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

nearly USD 30,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, other wards within the city are interested in replicating the pilot. To be led by the Lusaka City Council Public Health Department through the ward councilors.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The results of the survey in Desai and Lilanda Green has shown that information and incentives can influence a household’s decision to separate waste.  Due to sensitisations made before the endline survey, the attitude of most households changed which led to the number of households reusing waste increasing from 38.0% at baseline to 65.2% at endline.  The number of households willing to separate waste if given an incentive by paying less for garbage collection increased slightly from 85.3% at midline to 99.0% at endline. The number of households willing to separate waste if given information on its benefits also increased slightly from 93.0% at midline to 99.5% at endline.The number of households separating waste for recycling increased from 15.0% to 70.9 at midline and endline while the number of households who paid less to CBE because of separating waste increased from 17.3% at midline to 35.6% at endline.  As much as the households in both communities are very willing to separate waste and sell to the CBE, unfortunately a number of households expressed disappointment with the CBE’s commitment to collect and buy the waste on time. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

·       The survey was done during the rainy season and this led to delays in completing the interviews on time.

·       There was lack of cooperation from a few respondents during the beginning of the survey but after explaining the importance of the survey, the issue was resolved.

·       Bias in the selection of key informants for the focus group discussions.

·       Political influence as the project was somehow linked to a political party initiative. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Teams working on behavioral change methods to influence separation of waste at source. The results of the experiment provide a proof of concept to support the case of larger evaluation targeting community involvement in waste management and recycling initiatives. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

After the dissemination event the Town Clark and Mayor suggested that this activity be scaled to other high-density communities.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

To use different experimental groups and control groups and longer monitoring period to understand the pure effects of each intervention.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The project was under the CIDS and had a heavy influence of collective intelligence tools and the solutions implemented were sourced from the community. These processes were led by both the Solution Mapper and Explorer. If we had more funding, we could have used some digital solutions to help in monitoring.
