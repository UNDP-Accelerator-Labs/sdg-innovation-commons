Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT.  One challenge identified is that with the influx of hoards of tourists of predominantly Bengali ethnicity, the local indigenous populations can feel a sense of loss of agency. To reduce the level of “othering” of the locals, the tour guides should be local residents instead of people from outside the CHT who might be better trained but not necessarily familiar with the local context.
