> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Earthquake Games


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Too much front-loading of the probability of earthquakes and the damage they make may be overwhelming for a young child, whereas sanitizing the situation may frustrate older children. Edutainment facility can work the best for the purpose.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Türkiye is a highly earthquake prone country with severe disasters happening occasionally. The risks, especially for the largest city Istanbul are talked widely in media with threatening hazard scenarios. The constant flow of those messages negatively affect the psychology of people, including children. On the other hand there needs to be a proper disaster awareness and preparedness effort to build resilience in the society.  



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

There are earthquake scenarios based on the fault lines and historical evidence data in Turkiye, yet limited activities for creating awareness targeting children.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Children are exposed to mass media communication on the likelihood of earthquakes. Sensitivity needs to be developed for resilience and preparedness.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



20 games for children's earthquake preparedness by experts will be prepared and tested at a school for potential application country wide through the national education system. AccLab will ensure the games are based on a research at other country practices, especially Japan, and developed within the realities and sensitivities of local context, using the latest innovations.



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Gamification methodology suits better for the disaster context, targeting children.



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



20 different games will be developed and applied on a target group to understand the impact on children's awareness and preparedness for earthquakes



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Earthquake games are not practiced in Türkiye, hence the impact will need to be assessed on the target group during piloting. 


## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The innovative games developed for children received positive reaction. The model can be utilized by the Ministry of National Education and Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency. The project is going on with potential additional contribution from the donor. The results will be shared wit
