> Title of the innovation

How to enhance literacy in pupils with visual impairment

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation seeks to improve the levels of literacy in pupils with  visual impairment. In order to achieve this, various strategies, techniques and effort will be put in place to enhance writing and reading skills among blind learners. With myself being a braille user from the time I started school coupled with the knowledge and skills I acquired during my teacher training course, I know what needs to be done in order for literacy levels to improve among blind learners. 

Your positive consideration will be highly appreciated and will be beneficial to a lots of learners with visual impairment in my country, my region and the African continent at large.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With my innovation, people living with blindness will be able to manipulate money making it easier for them M to start up businesses and venture into some form of farming. This will create great opportunities for people with visual impairment.

> Technical Feasibility

Kasempa is estimated to have more than 700 people living with blindness and most of them have no idea about braille and and they cannot manipulat money neither can they read nor write using braille.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will help a lot of blind learners lead an independent life as they grow older in that they will be able to read and write as well as understand anything presented to them. It will also enable blind people have a wide variety of employment choices. If well implemented, it will also reduce the number of blind beggars on the streets and make blind people venture in two projects that would create wealth for them.
Literacy is the Key to success.
