## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Curating a space for Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Leadership
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

There is clear evidence of multiple bodies, institutions, groups and initiatives focussing on the area of innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership, however there is a lack of connection and communication to create a homogenous body where all have in common. The challenge is to create a shared physical and virtual space where these stakeholders can come together and create an atmosphere for youth and entrepreneurship development. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As this is an exploratory bet, these are the answers we look to find - we have a number of partners who are working in this area and hope to be able to join dots in order to create this entrepreneur ecosystem.  InnovaLab is an innovation company who has begun to work on this and explore what is already existing in the country in relation to entrepreneurship and ways in which is can be mapped. Liaising with InnovaLab, will likely lead us to others who work in the same field of entrepreneurship.  Lack of basic services mean people are not able to access information and networks which can support them in exploring and creating something which falls within the area of entrepreneurship. Furthermore, there are no platforms physical or virtual to encourage entrepreneurship. Financial or investing opportunities to develop these skills are not existing.  Actors involved: state and population, Ianda Guine, Djemberem, Djassi Africa, Fabrica de Start ups Brazil, ANEJ, AIGB, Academia de Liderança. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">

The image below displays the mapping of existing initiatives demonstrating the existence of them but with weak signals.  "the lack of common space to discuss and grow" "the existing barriers created by the government to open a business, which can be overcome if you have the knowledge which can be provided by mentorship, which is also seldom seen."  "How expensive it is to become an entrepreneur, so many people stay in the inform sector because they can make so much money" "allows room for monopolies because those who can afford can exploit those who cannot and give less choice to the consumers"

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value of the AccLab being involved in solving this challenge is that these entrepreneurs can support in the facilitation of basic quality services which falls under the frontier challenge. Given that they come from the communities, they understand the challenges and are more likely to develop responses that suit the community and their needs, being from the context. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are working on building an entrepreneurial ecosytem in Guinea-Bissau. A system that will be able to support development of the country.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Understand the existing entrepreneur ecosystem in Guinea-Bissau?  In what ways has this ecosytem worked if present?  If not present, in what ways could an ecosystem benefit the country's development?  How can the Accelerator Lab support the building of this ecosytem using its methodology and partners?  What is the bottleneck for entrepreneurship in the country and how can it be tackled?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The chosen methods will allow us to collaborate in order to co-create a system that is beneficial to the country, but that is also sustainable in the long term. Understanding the context through sense making will create room for co-creation, participatory design and ethnography. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Partnering with the unusual partner Orange, will allow us to tap into the data surrounding mobile phone usage  all in ways which are beneficial to achieve a better understanding of the entrepreneurial presence in the country. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Young people who demonstrate interest in entrepreneurship. We have already begun to garner an understanding on what is already available through working with Radio Jovem. A national radio station who works closely with young people and has a high following engagement to be able to identify and motivate people with entrepreneurial drive for the good of the society. Ongoing hackthons that can support in the mentorship of those who arise from the exploration.
