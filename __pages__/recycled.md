Preserving trees - shade and sitting area for taxi stand

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Walking around my locality, I observed that the trees of the taxi stand had been preserved and made into benches by the taxi drivers instead of being cut (like so many other taxi stands over the island). They wanted to preserve the environment and hence have transformed the trees into some sitting space as well as shade providers as they work through the day, especially during the hot summers over the island. Just a small note, there was also an area within the trees that they had transformed into a prayer spot for their work.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Dry, heavy sunshine and droughts are affecting so many areas of the island. Trees are cut for development and most of the time no new trees are planted.  Therefore this observation of preservation of trees throughout development and enhancement of the locality is the perfect example that sustainable development of the locality, cleaner environment for the taxi drivers as well as the preservation of trees for shade making and sitting area can work together.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Development is possible, through the most sustainable way. Trees do not need to be cut down for development or settlement. Development and preservation of the environment can work together and this observation is the perfect example of the community commitment to sustainable development and preservation of the environment.
