> Title of the innovation

Information Technology For Non-Specialists

> Brief description of the innovation

That the global pandemic, COVID-19, has forced the world to rethink the future of work is a truism that requires no contest. Digital disruption and artificial intelligence have shown us how machines can carry out work in a less costly and effective manner than human beings, especially when people have to work remotely from home during the pandemic. Closely related to this, the development of ICTs continues to be driven by forces such as digital disruption and artificial intelligence in a world that is not only grappling with the pandemic but is also experiencing exponential growth in technological innovations. 
ICTs continue to permeate facets of human endeavour, enabling newer and quicker ways of relaying information and communicating. In Zambia, the influence of ICT has been recognized in the Seventh National Development Plan (2017 – 2021) further resonating with SDG number 9 with specific reference to Target 9.c, i.e., universal access to ICTs. Be that as it may, the challenges of inadequate infrastructure and less suitable skillsets in many developing countries continue to work against the realisation of the full potential of ICTs. It is against this backdrop that this submitted innovation, an academic sourcebook titled, IT For Non-Specialists was written.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The potential market for this initiative are many but not limited to Higher Education Institutions (HEI) currently estimated at over 60 public and private universities, over 300 TEVETA institutions, private and public non-academic institutions, libraries  and individual students. The implementation phase shall involve bulk printing of copies on pre-order basis to HEIs. However, for purposes of book advertising and alternative sales, some copies shall be made available to existing bookshops operating in selected cities and towns in Zambia.
ICT is cross-cutting subject taught nearly across all learners pursuing diverse disciplines of study. Foreign sourced ICT books are available in the market but the general setting and context are skewed to fit the environments, in which those books are authored, a factor that more often than not leaves majority students outside those jurisdictions more disillusioned. This book was written to address this challenge. The liberalization of the education sector by the government has fueled growth of privately driven HEIs. These, alongside already existing HEIs are potential markets. The knowledge from Chapter 10 imparts on the minds of learners the dangers of e-waste and its impact on the environment and the need to manage obsolete digital devices in more environmentally sustainable ways.

> Technical Feasibility

The book authoring process was carried out over a period of more than three years, i.e., from late 2017 to 2021. The manuscript which contains ten chapters with maximum 300 pages underwent publication processes during the first quarter of 2021. 
The authoring process followed an iterative approach that entailed linking of each new chapter to the preceding ones. Finally once the whole manuscript was completed, chapter forward-chaining, i.e., linking related aspects of the book across the chapters to each other was performed. 
The author availed each of the ten chapters in the manuscript to carefully selected computer science and IT lecturers and professionals working at relevant institutions for independent reviews, feedback were incorporated as such. These institutions included Copperbelt University, Kwame Nkrumah University, University of Zambia, Evelyn Hone College, University of Lusaka, ZCAS University, Bank of Zambia, Zambia Electronic Clearing House Limited, IFE, World Bank in Washington DC, Zambia Information and Communications Authority, Smart Zambia Institute, Centres for Disease Control, and Ministry of Health. 
The consolidated manuscript that incorporated reviewed chapters was subsequently submitted to an independent IT consultant for further scrutiny. The final manuscript from the independent IT consultant was then submitted for editing and proofreading to book publisher.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The influence of ICTs has been acknowledged by stakeholders and governments’ world-over. As such the learning of ICT has been made mandatory at early formative years of schooling, at primary and through to secondary school education in many countries. In Zambia, while locally authored academic books intended for teaching and learning at primary and secondary schools exist, the case is not so with higher education institutions. Classroom experience over time has shown that most students particularly in Zambia, encounter challenges in relating ICT concepts that are taught in typical classroom settings to their own daily work or general life experiences because, nearly all the available ICT academic literature and the example cases provided in those textbooks are skewed mostly to foreign experiences. This book was written to address those specific gaps by domesticating ICT concepts to local settings and contexts in an easy to understand manner so that students in higher education can easily relate to, and, therefore, understand while at the same-time convey the underlying theme of the book, which is the value of ICT to socio-economic development in a globalized world. Knowledge is a key factor in the market, and creative innovations are derived from explicitly codified knowledge.
