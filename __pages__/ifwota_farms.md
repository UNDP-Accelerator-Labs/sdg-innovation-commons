> Brief description of the innovation

Ifwota farms is part of my vast innovations that I have had ever since childhood, it's a farm with a lot of products which are underway currently I have acquired about 1hectare of land and another hectare on rent to grow ground nuts to be supplied to bring a push in the working capital while I am striving to order and resell goats with a target of enlarging the capital so that I realise the ambitions of a commercial farm in the area with different kinds of farm products and livestock and fish farming. And I definitely believe and willing to create jobs and other commercial farmers in the area.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By growing crop and rearing livestock as well as fish farming and then sell them at the markets such as kasumbalesa border, Lusaka based industries and markets this will bring much income. This will help in maintaining constant supply of these products to the market and industry thus keeping the economy running and maintaining people's jobs. The challenge prize will be of great importance in that it will reduce on the time of actualization it will help in quick  actualization in short. The value is so precious in that with farming we are able to feed nations and kick out the global pandemic of hunger and joblessness that is hunting our populations, as though that is not enough with plantations in the area we will be solving the cancer of global warming and climate change on our environment, thus contributing to  restoration  of our sun screen Ozone layer.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently I am hiring the available   local ploughing services, and have bought a one hectare in chifue of manyinga district Zambia and am in the Lusaka city looking for piecerates in order to raise the much needed capital unfortunately with the canning economy the idea has been delayed but am still working had to realise it.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There will much light to the area as this farm will bring about advanced social services such schools, clinics, hammer mills, clean water and sanitation, recreational facilities, shopping complexes, transport services, accommodation, of course other investments will follow suit as this light continues to expand as other investors will be motivated to move in. This will help encourage locals to rise and achieve the personal goals and dreams of education and research goals will be accomplished because I am scientifically motivated and very much willing in growing scientific research minds in the children and those interested to bring about improved society
