> Title of the innovation

Intemba 2.0

> Brief description of the innovation

Intemba cloud is a localized e-commerce business that allows buying items from the black market electronically using a local terminal in a local compound. A terminal is a fabricated shipping container fitted with a computer and a big monitor where customers should see and choose items to buy through a mobile money payment gateway. The system will have a town terminal that will be receiving orders from customers and be sent through registered taxis going to the routes where orders were placed. Customers should then collect their items at their local terminal after receiving a notification from Intemba that their order is ready.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed in such a way that a local terminal in the compound (shipping container) will be fitted with a computer installed with software that will be taking orders which should update the town terminal about the orders placed. the workers in town will order on behalf of the customer then send a registered taxi driver to deliver to a local terminal where the order was placed.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will create a market for black market products thereby improving the businesses of local marketeers. It will also be convenient for most people especially the busy working class in compounds to buy products from the black market without having to go there.
