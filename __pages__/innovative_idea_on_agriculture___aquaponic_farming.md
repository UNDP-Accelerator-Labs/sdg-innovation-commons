INNOVATIVE IDEA ON AGRICULTURE - AQUAPONIC FARMING

> Brief description of the innovation

Aquaponics is a blend of hydroponics (growing plants in water) and aquaculture (raising fish). This is a new and “innovative” idea, although has been around for centuries. It is resurfacing in our modern world and attracting many people.
Aquaponics is an evolving closed-system food production technology that integrates recirculating aquaculture with hydroponics. In this paper we give a brief literature overview of the benefit aspects of aquaponics by discussing its social, environmental, and economic impacts in different potential settings. The technology might be applied to commercial or community based urban food production, industrial scale production in rural areas, small scale farming in
developing countries or as systems for education and decoration inside buildings. We concluded that due to the different potential applications and settings for installing the technology, benefit impacts need to be considered separately and that due the complexity, communities, urban and rural infrastructure and policy settings, further research and data acquisition is needed to be able to assess all benefit aspects.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Commercial aquaponics is a young sector of agriculture, with the concept of aquaponics emerging for the first time close to 50 years. In recent years, there has been a reinvigoration of interest in these systems, due to their sustainability benefits, and many "ecopreneurs" have turned their hand to developing aquaponic farming businesses for profit.
Aquaponics systems rely on the synergy between plants growing in water (hydroponics), and fish living in that same water (aquaculture). The waste of the fish acts as a 'fertilizer' for the plants, while the plants purify the water for the fish.Currently, commercial aquaponics system farms exist primarily in controlled environments, such as greenhouses or outdoor locations with favorable climates. Mexico, Canada, the USA, Australia, and a few other countries have emerged as pioneers in the niche of commercial aquaponic farming in recent years. However, the total number of enterprises remains quite small.
That is not to say that aquaponic farming is without merit. On the contrary, the industry is showing great potential. In 2013, the Industry ARC reported "Aquaponics as an industry has a potential market size of around $180m in 2013 and this is expected to cross $1bn in sales by 2020.” That's 455% growth in 7 years.
According to a 2014 study by Johns Hopkins University, which surveyed 257 commercial aquaponics growers in the USA, only 31% of respondents declared they were profitable in the last year. Moreover, 55% said they expected to be profitable the following year, with 70% proclaiming aquaponic farming was not their primary source of income.

This data clearly shows there are real challenges facing commercial aquaponic farmers that must be faced and overcome if they are to become profitable. However, it is important to take these numbers with a grain of salt. It is entirely possible that not all of the growers surveyed intend to make aquaponics their primary income source. Furthermore, the average time in business at the time of surveying was 4 years, which is arguably too short to see a profit anyway.

> Technical Feasibility

In the case of a backyard System, you may be doing it as a hobby or to support the family or maybe just to bring some tomatoes and salad on the table for dinner. But on the commercial scale, the aquaponics farm is supposed to raise capital and profitable. To evaluate the economic backbone of aquaponic farms, we need to dive in: Capital/Investment cost (building the system, setup the operation logistics, etc.) Operational cost Profitability of the operation Aquaponics is profitable when it is done to a specific scale. Investment cost is relatively high which is the main drawback of aquaponics. In operational cost, more electricity is used as compared to traditional aquaponics. However, labor cost including plowing and pests is reduced. Water is conserved which is the main consumption in traditional agriculture. Recurring expenditures, on the whole, are lower as compared to traditional agriculture.
The average size of the operations is .03 acres (1,307 sq. ft.). About 40% of operations are backyard/home-based; the others were on commercial or agricultural land. Although Most growers used a combination of 2 or more aquaponics systems (media, wicking beds, rafts, NFT, and vertical towers), the rafts and media beds were the most common. Only 31% of growers were profitable. The 55% forecasted to be profitable within the next 12 months and 75% aimed to be profitable in the next 36 months. The commercial aquaponics operation was not the primary source of income for 70% of owners. Not a single farm was able to make fish production profitable. Is fish merely a nutrient source for the plant? Or, can fish be a profitable enterprise of the system? Nevertheless, the Fish growth rate has to improve for the fish enterprise to yield the profit.

> Anticipated Social Impact

NO PESTICIDES.
Vegetables are grown naturally, without pesticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilizers.Greenhouse Nutritionally, food grown in an aquaponic garden is healthier, fresher and genuinely organic. Plants and fish are not contaminated with pesticides or weed killers. Everything used to cultivate vegetable and fruit-producing plants is natural and chemical-free, including fertilizers formulated to improve the overall operation of an aquaponic system.

CLEAN FOOD.
Fish are raised in clean water, and are never exposed to antibiotics, growth hormones, or pollutants. Vegetables are grown without soil using clearflow aquaponics systems.

NEVER FROZEN.
Our produce is always fresh, never frozen.

KNOW THE SOURCE.
Food quality and safety are top priorities. We employ bio-security protocols, as well as GAP agriculture and food safety procedures.

SUSTAINABLE.
Fish and produce grown sustainably, using less water, land, labor, and energy.

PREMIUM QUALITY.
TilapiaOur controlled environment produces all natural,
top quality food.

WATER FRIENDLY.
No soil is used in growing, which dramatically reduces the washing required.

YEAR-ROUND SUPPLY.
No waiting for products to be in season. Our products are available 365 days a year.

SUPPORT LOCAL AGRICULTURE.
Greatly decrease the distance your food has to travel from source to consumer.

Currently, the aquaponics market is experiencing steady growth. In 2017, the global aquaponics market was valued at $523.7 million, and the total global market value for aquaponics systems will likely reach $870 million by 2022. Commercial-scale food growers and urban backyard farmers contribute to the growth. If this trend continues, access to locally-grown fish and salad greens raised using economical and sustainable farming methods will increase. Imagine a world where dining tables serve dishes made from organic as well as farm-fresh produce. Can it get any better than that? The aquaponics system aquarium is a farming innovation we should look forward to practicing.
