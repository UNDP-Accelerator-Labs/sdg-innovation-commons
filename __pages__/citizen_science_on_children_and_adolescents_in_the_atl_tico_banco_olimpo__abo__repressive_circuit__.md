## Overall goal

Collaboratively reconstruct, analyze, and make visible the experiences of child victims of the genocidal process within the framework of the repressive practices deployed on children and adolescents (NNyA, by its Spanish acronym) in the Atlético-Banco-Olimpo (ABO) circuit between 1977 and 1979. 
## Specific goals

Reconstruct the repressive practices perpetrated on NNyA within the ABO repressive circuit. 

Build a public archive of interviews with survivors of repressive experiences in their childhood. 

Participate in legal proceedings by providing evidence about NNyA who were victims of repressive practices within the framework of the ABO circuit. 

 
## Description of citizen participation

The construction of scientific knowledge about the genocidal process and its consequences requires the active participation of different sectors of society that contribute, each from its own particularity, their knowledge and practices. Together, a heterogeneous group of child victims, workers from the memory sites of the ABO circuit, judicial officers, and research teams from the University of Buenos Aires and the National University of Tres de Febrero carry out the different stages of the research project, from the drafting and construction of the general and specific goals and the survey instruments to the fieldwork.
