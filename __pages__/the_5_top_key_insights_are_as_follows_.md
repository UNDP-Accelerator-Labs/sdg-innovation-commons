## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The 5 top key insights are listed as follows: - There is a substential lack of data on the waste challenge in Mauritania - There is a significant lack of  corrdination between different actors in referecne t othis challenge - The waste sites database generated through this cycle has been proved to be the first of their kind in the country - There is a need to Scall-up this sollution to other cities in Mauritania - The generated dataset will have a significant impact on the waste management at the households level

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
A blog documenting the waste management in Mauritania has been elabored and submitted for publication ( the Lab is nested in the Policy & strategy Unit and all knowledge products are submitted to this unit for approval & publication)


> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The main barrier is the Slownesness in UNDP process of validation ( blogs, consultencies, aproval of workshops)

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Following the sensemaking and exploration phases, we observed a significant lack on waste sites data. We chose these types of data because of: - official data are lacking or poorly documented, which justifies the use of non-traditional data such spatial geographical data. - Our sensing phase and intercation with local communities led us to consider the survey generated data. This enbaled the hired consultant to merge different sources of data to provide a comprehensite dataset on the status of the waste sites in the capitay city.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods were combined to extract information from different sources and ensure that the proble is tackled from its orgine (household). Therefore, we were able to have a clear vision on the contribution to generate the datasetand to have a spatial mapping of the waste sites across the city.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked mainly with national partners and the private sector. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked mainly with national partners and the private sector.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

we worked with the SMTD a private company that manages the waste in the capital city we also identified some innovators (Smat Trash, daily garbage collectors,  etc).

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of environment, Ministry of the interior, main municipalities, etc

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The innovators were new to the UNDP list of partners : Smart Trash, daily garbage collectors,

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Sustainable development unit UNDP
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This combination led us to see things differently, particularly, from the local communities pererpectives. That is, key challenges at the community and household levels pointed us toward the right type of data to be collected to ensure a proper handeling of the waste challenge.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
