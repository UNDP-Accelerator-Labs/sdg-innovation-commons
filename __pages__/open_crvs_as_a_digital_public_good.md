Even though civil registration is critical to citizen participation and effective governance, 44% of countries do not have functioning CRVS systems. Countries are currently stuck with inefficient paper-based systems or expensive and poorly designed information systems that are not flexible enough to adapt to changing operational environments. These existing systems do not meet the needs and capacities of the civil registration staff, leaving large parts of the population unregistered, unrecognised, and unprotected.

OpenCRVS is challenging the current gap in the market for a user-centric and rights-based CRVS system by leading the development of OpenCRVS, an open-source digital CRVS solution that is free to use, adaptable to the country context, interoperable with other government systems (e.g. health and ID systems), and rights-based to ensure it protects and provides for those most vulnerable.

 

OpenCRVS has the potential to go well beyond the scope of traditional CRVS systems. We see OpenCRVS as a foundational identity and population data system which will support and maintain the integrity of many other service delivery, statistical and identity management functions. In particular, OpenCRVS will ensure that these functions are above all inclusive, providing a digital response to the global call to “Leave No One Behind”.

Digital Transformation is one of the top priority areas for the government. In this a secure, open source technology for creating digital public good is quite relevant for Samoa and other SIDS that are trying to overcome the geographical exclusion through effective employment of digital solutions.
