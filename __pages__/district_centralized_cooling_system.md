> Description of the solution

In Guangzhou, China, the municipal government adopted regional centralized cooling as part of a green and environmentally friendly modern urban centre in the core area of the Pearl River New City development. 
The primary
driving energy of the main unit in the regional air cooling system is mainly come from electric power.
Some of unit is driven by heat source (steam or hot water). The local enevironmental temperature in the core area of Zhijiang New Town was reduced by 2-3 degrees celsius compared to using distributed cooling systems.
