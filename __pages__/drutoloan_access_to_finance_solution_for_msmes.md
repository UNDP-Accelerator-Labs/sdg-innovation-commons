## What is the challenge?

MSMEs contribute more than 25% of Bangladesh’s GDP. However, a majority struggle to access finance from traditional financial institutions. The credit gap in the MSME sector is estimated to be $2.8 billion. There are several hundred banks and MFIs, yet 95% of the MSMEs do not get formal financing. Formal financial institutions face various challenges when it comes to financing MSMEs including verification, assessment, and recovery due to a lack of standard due diligence process on the financial institutions’ part and a lack of documents and financial literacy on the MSMEs' part.
## What is the solution? How does it work?

Drutoloan is building an efficient lending system for the MSME to provide end-to-end digital and at-location services to MSMEs. It has a “PHYSI-TAL'' approach. The application process, the verification process, and disbursement and collection all are fast, easy, and flexible and follow a hybrid model of physical and digital operation to provide customers with a unique financial experience.

It has created a credit scoring engine that collects and measures MSMEs against more than 50 data points across three basic categories that include financial discipline, business performance, and compliance. “We use various data points and sources to provide scoring on these three categories because the rigid credit scoring system doesn’t work for these entrepreneurs,” explains Abdul Gaffar Sadi, Co-founder of Drutoload. “You do not have financial transactions in MFS or banks, show me your rent payment data for the last 12 months. For example, many of these MSMEs do not have a tax identification number, trade license, or both. We help them open the TIN and we assign a score to that. The trade license, the deeds, and how he keeps his accounts, we look into all these things. We also score on a psychrometric level such as how he thinks, his vision for and commitment to the business, and whether he is into it for the long run or short run.”

Drutoloan started with a cooperative society license, collecting deposits and lending in a particular zone in Dhaka. After working for a while and gathering enough experience and learning from the market, it took an MFI license. The company now partners and works with other banks, NBFIs, and MFIs who have better access to finance to make customized products for MSMEs. The company has created a process to verify and evaluate MSMEs for their creditworthiness which many formal financial institutions struggle with.
