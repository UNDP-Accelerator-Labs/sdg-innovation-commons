## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Defining informality and the informal sector is a rather complex issue that comes with many cultural and contextual connotations. To truly understand the challenge of informality we need to engage with the people working in the sector and understand their behaviors and insides on which we can create better informed policies. Based on the findings of 5 focus groups we learned that а significant room for improvement of the informal workers' awareness of the advantage/opportunities of formal employment exists - above all in order to protect their labor rights, ensure adequate benefits from the public institutions, continuous education, support in times of certain crises/troubles, and so on. Based on the social media sentiment analysis conducted for the past several years, one can conclude that in our society the theme 'Informal economy' has been related to sub-topics of Tax Evasion (higher correlation) and Labor Inspectorate (lower correlation). Furthermore, 237 media outlets in the past 3 years published 11.132 articles related to topics of Informal Economy. These articles reached 252.109 reactions/engagements (likes, comments, shares, emotions), or approximately 22 reactions per article. This is considered as a high reaction rate for such a large number of articles, stating that there is media interest on the subject that is presenting informal workers and informality mostly with negative connotation. Digital Labour Platforms are a new form of coordinating the provision of work services. Workers on such platforms are considered as a part of the informal economy. This space remains fairly open for further exploration. Workers that work in the sector of care, versus workers that are focused on IT and digital skills, have very different incentives to consider the formalization of their business.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

  There were no major barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system. One bottleneck that impact the system is that workers on Digital Labor Platforms  (DLP) are overlooked by the governmental authorities when it comes to their status. Most of them are not aware on how to legalize their work. Larger datasets would be useful to understand what is needed or what nudges will make them legalize their freelancer’s gigs and to what extend would they want to pay taxes.   On the other hand, we were pleasantly surprised that workers on DLP were more than happy to share their thoughts and visions in the focus groups when asked the questions regarding their employment status and what will motivate them to move into the formal sector.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

When we were doing desktop research on Informality in the country, we realized that there are gaps in data when it comes to understanding the behavior why informal workers stay informal workers. Bottom-up approach and understanding informal worker’s motivation were missing in most policy papers around which laws are based or updated. We used Social media sentiment analysis to collect data how informality and related words are perceived by the online media. The data that we explored shows trends in the Macedonian digital media sphere and weak signals how better to pursue and articulate the prevalence, impact, and significance of content involving Informal Economy and related keywords.  On the other hand, focus groups helped us create narratives through which was possible to analyses many different aspects, cause-effect relationships and factors in the informal economy field, as they are perceived by the informal workers. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

As an Accelerator Lab we were involved in co-creating all the activities conducted by the organizations and partners in this topic. This modality was useful  not only for us to be more agile when it come to implementing the activities but also helped us produce better ‘learnings’ on how the system, government, media and CSOs, interacted with informal workers; This made us adapt our interventions as we explored the subject more; 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborated on co-designing the focus groups with the public policy research organization Analytica MK. Analytica MK is well know organization in the country that focuses on the topic of informality and in the previous year has published a report on informal workers that we wanted to build upon. Partnering with them gave us the opportunity to tap into their ecosystem and learning generated over the past years.  Based on the findings from the focus groups we prepared a report on Informal worker’s perceptions and experiences from the informal economy that was shared in the country office.   Some of the key findings of the report are the advantages and disadvantages of the functioning within the informal sector and micronarratives around them;  Furthermore, we are in close cooperation with the Impact Foundation, who are implementing the project RECONOMY that works on improving informed self-employment opportunities through freelancing on digital platforms, including mentoring by already experienced freelancers. We are comparing notes on regular basis as some of our efforts are complimentary to each other.  

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We cooperated with a Professor from the State Faculty for economics whose scientific research field of interest is public finances, macroeconomic policies, and theory in the co-creation of the reports on Informal worker’s perceptions, where his insights in the tax policies were more than useful in preparing the policy recommendations; 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We cooperated with Pikasa Analytics data analytics company operating in SEE region, specialized  in media analytics and strategical development and monitoring of media outlets & social media channels for the social media sentiment analysis. We used Pikasa’s social media data center to access unique data from more than 400 online media outlets, which served as primary data in the preparation of the social media sentiment analysis report.   

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

For this learning cycle we partner with one of the most important CSOs in our society when talking about the informal sector, they had published a report on the informal sector amid the covid19 pandemic prior to our engagement with them. So we benefited from that collaboration, because they already had access and a network into the informal sector. Moreover, we collaborated with a data analytics company to conduct a media sentiment analysis, to help us understand the narratives in our public discourse about informality better.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborated with a CO project that aims to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance in improving overall financial management and ensuring good governance in managing public resources. The project is  using our findings to learn more about the perceptions and opinions of workers in the informal sector in order to create more data and citizen driven policies.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay of innovative methods, new forms of data and co-creating papers and analysis with unusual partners enabled us to have a holistic approach to such a complex topic. If we didn’t use social media sentiment analysis we would not be aware what are the narratives around the topic of informality in our society for the past three years. For instance we learned that key societal opinion makers, rarely have topics from the informal economy in their focus. There were only 87 public opinions pieces on the topic,  written by 20 authors in this period, which is 0,4% of the total published opinion pieces in the period.  Furthermore, during the focus groups we found that students who are state scholarship receivers prefer to work in the informal sector because if they formalize they might use their scholarships, due to the law regulations;
