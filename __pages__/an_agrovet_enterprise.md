> Title of the innovation

AN AGROVET ENTERPRISE

> Brief description of the innovation

The agrovet enterprise is a company that deals with agriculture and vertinally products which will be the products available for customers specifically for farmers who grow crops and who keep animals

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Firstly it will generate income through the sells as it stands there is a great number of people who have ventured into farming meaning to say the seed's for planting any type of product is on demand, paste sides as well as paultry products like feed etc will be needed, the more the sells the more we generate income, it will bring competition in the market if you look at Lusaka agrovet and other campanies because they are well known things are expensive, as I start I would us a strategy which is to make my products to be slightly cheaper than theirs so that it will attract more customers because in business even a k5 is very big in terms of profit making

> Technical Feasibility

our implementation plan is to at least start with a k50 000, this will include all the stocks we need to establish the enterprise, we have not set up a final business plan due to how prices kept on increasing and we believe that soon things will reduce because of the new government that as come to stabilize our economy

> Anticipated Social Impact

it will create jobs for people who didn't have employment, it will give them financial stability as they will be earning a salary every month. Agriculture is what makes us have the food that we eat and I don't think with out it we can survive, this is so because every product we eat is from agriculture. The agrovet enterprise is very important because it will help farmers to buy products best for their crop production,  cattle rearing, paultry production, fish farming e.t.c this will make them have a good harvest even as we are also going to be advising them on how they are suppose to use the paste sides, weed killers , and which seeds are good for the current season and so forth and so on
