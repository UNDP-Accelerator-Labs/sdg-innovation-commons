Farm Trust is a startup that aims to eliminate the need for farmers to use middlemen to sell their produce. By delivering organic fruits and vegetables directly to the home, Farm Trust facilitates transactions between farmers and consumers. This way, farmers can increase their income and consumers have the opportunity to benefit from fresh products at lower costs.
