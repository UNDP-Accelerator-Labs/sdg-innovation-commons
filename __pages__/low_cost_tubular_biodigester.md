It was created for an area of ​​agricultural production where producers normally throw all the waste from animals (pigs, chickens) into the nearest river causing water pollution and energy waste that we can extracted from these feces. The low cost biodigester can prevent pollution and at the same time generate energy for the farms or the home.
