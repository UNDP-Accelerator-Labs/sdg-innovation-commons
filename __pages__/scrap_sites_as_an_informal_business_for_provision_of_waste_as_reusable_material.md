Scrap sites in Jordan serve as a provider of waste as a material that can be reused by different creatives, like designers of furniture and home accessories, "Escape the Room"  businesses for their spaces, and  film directors for movie sets. 


They function as an informal business and a scrap site owner we spoke to described himself as a business owner. They also work with pick up truck drivers who drive around to pick up scrap from neighborhoods. They may also have connections with migrant workers who work as apartment building guards and cleaners, who help the scrap sites with procuring material from apartments. 


They not only sell material, but they may also repair products (such as electronics) and sell them for half the original price. 





Notes from site visit: 

Pickup trucks gather  waste from houses

Trucks sell the scrap to the sites,

Scrap sites sell to factories  

Mostly customers are individuals  Or stores downtown; sometimes small companies 

Export to Syria 

No connection to fablabs in the country. Didn’t seem to have any sense of what a fablab is - something to explore further. 

Land is not regulated  . Difference in opinion on whether regulation would be a good thing. One person said it would be a headache financially, procedurally, etc. The other said that it would allow them to go into official tendering processes عطاءات 




They advertise their material on an online platform called Open Sooq. https://jo.opensooq.com/en

Observations: so many toilets, bidets, and sinks! What is the deal with so many being thrown away? So many colorful wooden doors. Steel, tires, wood scraps, plastic items

Outliers: exercise machines, children’s bikes and electric cars, typewriter, mannequin, old sewing machine, branded store shelves 

Questions/ideas: 

Can Fablabs use these scraps? Could the scrap sites benefit from a collaboration with the Fablabs in the country? 

Would they benefit from a way of organizing the scraps (currently very messy, some better than others) 

Do a visual mapping of what items get thrown away and use that to analyze consumption and what are the most commonly found scraps 

Can something be tested related to maintenance and reuse of these items?
