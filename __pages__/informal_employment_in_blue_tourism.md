## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning intents are:

1. How to address the vulnerable communities and vulnerable households and local women with decent employment?

2. How to strengthen livelihoods support of vulnerable local women through blue tourism?

3. How to increase demand for new market opportunities created by the entry of a large number of buyers as tourists in Blue Tourism?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF the community producer groups and stakeholders are mobilised, THEN production will be stabilised by creating higher demand for the blue economy products.

H2: IF the vulnerable host communities and jobless women can be trained with basic sewing techniques, THEN local products will be highlighted and attract the attention of the tourist as buyers.

H3: IF beneficiaries adapt home based production and local led income generation options, THEN the whole community will be benefitted as more employment opportunities will occur.

H4: IF the condition of community service providers can be developed, THEN it will increase market linkages enhanced to improve sustainable local income.

H5: IF new data can be generated based on this experiment and analysed for data driven decision making, THEN it can be used for better monitoring and strengthening the effectiveness of the initiative.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Non-monetary resources from UNDP projects: 1. Time allocation from teams; 2. Vulnerable group identification and selection; 3. Allocating venue from Local Government; 4. Provide equipment support like normal sewing.

Non-monetary resources from Women Chamber of Commerce in CXB included: 1. Month-long training and capacity building for vulnerable youths, most vulnerable impacted adolescents, separate and divorcee women, drowsy fisher’s women, and jobless or Job seeker youths and vulnerable women, and youths of host community.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, original hypothesis was proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It is our observation that, the methodology we used has worked well on our experiment. So, this methodology can be used in future.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

8 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

18,000 USD


> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, this activity requires a follow up stage to evaluate if these experimental activities have actually changed the lot of the vulnerable community as expected. Moreover, to encourage more vulnerable jobless people in sustainable employment activities and local income generation, this activity is planned to a next stage of interventions.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

This experiment is planned to scale for better outcome and large-scale implementation at the grassroot level, by empowering the local women through improving their economic stability, local capacity for harnessing blue economy opportunities contributing to local and national economic growth. During this experiment about 60 vulnerable women beneficiary received training on dress making and sewing machine operation in Cox's Bazar, of which 30 women have been employed in one local garment and they are earning from dress making. Following the success of this experiment, there is a plan to scale up this activity in Saint Martin's Island (the most attractive and coral enriched small island in Bangladesh), with the technical support of Women Chamber of Commerce. Before scaling this activity in Saint Martin's, we will conduct need assessment and women's interest in employment generating activities. If greater demand is generated, we will be replicating this activity in other potential areas.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Inspiring the vulnerable women to empower them through sustainable employment is not as easy as we projected. Extreme domestication has detained the women from out of home income generating activities. At the same time poverty and lack of education has been two underpinning obstacles to the provision of women in being self-sufficient and empowered. Another learning we received from the experiment is that due to financial incapacity and lack of investment in blue tourism, the blue economy sector is lagging behind to flourish to its optimum level.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Main obstacle and challenges as follow:
1. The patriarchal and male dominating culture in Cox's Bazar has restricted women to come out from their home to involve in income generating activities in some cases
2. It was challenging to ensure the participation of all targeted vulnerable women on regular basis
3. Another big challenge was to ensure quality cloth purchasing for dress making and assuring the profit margin in local level


> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The project managers, field team, and other staff at UNDP who are directly or indirectly involved in this experiment might benefit from the experimental activity. As this activity would add value to the community by contributing to the economic and social development while upholding the value and integrity of UNDP.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The vulnerable community especially the women of Cox's Bazar, partners organization, public and private sector actors, vendors, trainers as well as suppliers of raw materials might benefit from the results of the experiment, because they are becoming capacitated to engage in income generating activities, becoming self-sufficient through empowerment, and becoming aware of their rights and opportunities.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, based on the need and reachable outcome, this experiment might require several iterations. To cover large scale beneficiaries and target group, this experiment would be iterated in 5/6 other locations including small islands.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

This experiment does not require any special guidance but before replicating this activity it should be kept in consideration about the sustainability of the outcome. The continuation of business in dress making would require private sector investment or any sustainable source to buy raw materials time to time. And finding ready dress market in the local and national context is also a potential risk factor to this activity.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this experiment be replicated in another thematic areas or other SDGs, for example, blue economy, youth unemployment, decent job, sustainable cities, small island development etc. consisting of the SDGs like 8, 10, 12, 14, 17 etc.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore phases of the learning cycle influenced this experiment greatly as this is a kind of exploratory experiment to empower women through blue economy components. The sense phase of the experiment played a major role in assessing the need of the vulnerable community to engage them in income generating opportunities through blue economy.

> What surprised you?

Surprisingly, while experimenting on the first batch of women and girls in dress making, more women and vulnerable girls were showing interest in receiving training on dress making and tailoring for engaging them in income generating activities.
