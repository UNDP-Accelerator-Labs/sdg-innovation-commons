## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Supporting innovative start-ups to grow the economy, enhance service delivery and move towards Real Impact & Sustainability
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in certain parts of South Africa, service delivery is entirely absent or in a poor state. The associated challenge is unemployment and poor economic growth.   Parts of the population lack access to services like water or energy - services considered a basic human right. Take for example "load shedding" in South Africa - the term used to describe how SA's National Energy Provider routinely "shuts off" energy supply to communities, in a rotational manner, in order to to balance the demand and supply in the country. Many are left without energy for up to 6-8 hours - severely impacting the ailing South Africa economy, healthcare, education, etc.  On the flip side - there are emerging start-ups and innovators with brilliants ideas on how to implement sustainable energy solutions like solar and wind energy, or how to enhance water availability by accessing ground water. Herein lies the opportunity. How can we support small businesses in addressing national crises.  Given the economic crises in South Africa, where unemployment rates have soared to close to 40% and GDP growth is poor, supporting such businesses will not only solve the service delivery challenge, but also help create new economic opportunities, new sectors, new jobs, new possibilities, etc.  A secondary but as important challenge being addressed in this action plan, is how innovative businesses  think about sustainability. Inventing a sustainable solution, like renewable energy is certainly needed, however, have businesses considered sustainability within their operations and supply chains. For example, are the farmers supplying the organic material for biofuel production planting crops using less water, or in  a manner that reduces land degradations, and are they paying fair wages and treating workers fairly? Are the manufacturing facilities used energy efficient?  They need to be, in order to be around in the future to support such business. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Lets consider the energy challenge in South Africa (SA) as an example of poor service delivery:  Eskom - the national energy provider in SA currently battles to meet the energy  demand in the country – here’s why. -  Poor maintenance issues at ESKOM power stations. Rising generation costs, falling revenues, crumbling infrastructure, and decades of corruption and mismanagement  Post apartheid (1994) energy demand soared, driven by rapid economic growth and by the extension of coverage to deprived black townships. Eskom acquired millions of consumers in the post-apartheid years, but its expansion was hindered by poor governance. Government then announced a costly overhaul, including plans for two huge new power plants - Kusile and Medupi. Kusile and Medupi were meant to have become fully operational by 2015, but their construction has been beset by spiralling costs, delays and corruption scandals. Today, Kusile and Medupi plants are still years from completion, while their projected cost has doubled, weighing down Eskom's finances. The price of coal has gone up, as has the cost of employing a workforce that is almost 50% larger now than it was 10 years ago.  ESKOM has been forced to hike tariffs, which has contributed to a drop in sales. The load shedding cuts into Eskom's revenues and also hurts the economy at large, lowering industrial output and business productivity.   Adapted from: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47232268.   Lets consider the Economic and employment crises in South Africa: The consequence of a lack of structural transformation in South Africa meant that the country was in a precarious economic position even before the COVID pandemic. Stubbornly high levels of unemployment were already at 29.1% at the end of 2019. Poverty remains high. In 2015, over half of the population — 30.4 million people — lived below the official poverty line. A quarter — 13.8 million people — lived in ‘extreme poverty’, unable to afford enough food to meet their basic physical needs. South Africa’s growth has trended downwards since 2010. In 2019, South Africa was plunged into its third recession since 1994. Precipitating factors included: the global financial crisis, declining commodity prices, deindustrialisation, systemic corruption, budgetary cuts, restrictive macroeconomic policies, slowed investment as a result of economic stagnation, and insufficient electricity supply and resultant blackouts, amongst others. The Covid-19 crisis came at a time when South Africa was already in a recession. After a 7% economic contraction in GDP in 2020, the economy continues to shed jobs as the unemployment rate reaches a record high of 32.6 per cent.   Adapted from: https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/economy-and-ecology/south-africas-never-ending-crisis-5331/#:~:text=After%20a%207%20per%20cent,themselves%2C%20creating%20a%20vicious%20cycle And then the challenge of thinking about sustainability as an emerging business: https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-case-for-sustainability -

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Value add: AccLab SA and UNDP SA has the power to convene partners is a neutral manner. For example, the two key partners that have committed to the project, traditionally do not work together in this particular field (Innovation for Local Economic Development). The National Partner has actually been mandated to implement these kinds of projects only within previously disadvantaged cities. By UNDP showcasing the value of working with both cities - those that are and are not classified as previously disadvantaged, these parties have come to the table bring unique perspectives, and resources.   AccLab SA recently got trained on Sustainable Business Strategy - a strategy to grow businesses (financially)while focusing on the social and environmental sustainability of the business. This strategy is not commonly known in SA, especially among start-ups (who are at the opportune phase to embed such practices), and therefore mainstreaming this kind of thinking within innovative businesses is a UNDP AccLab value add, and provides us with a competitive edge when implementing such projects.   Learning from the network - AccLab SA has ties with other AccLabs across the globe thinking about how to address similar challenges. AccLab SA can  draw on this knowledge hub for inspiration. Not many IPs in SA have such reach for leverage international best practices and knowledge.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1. Are early stage businesses in the innovation space implementing sustainable business strategies  - strategies that focus on financial gain while being socially and environmentally responsible? If not, why, and how easy is it to pivot to stageies that do? 2. Can support for early stage innovation businesses accelerate their adoption/uptake in industry towards accelerating national economic and employment growth?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Future Analysis - how are early stage innovative businesses thinking about their impact on people and planet in the future. How can they adapt their strategies now to prevent negative consequences later while ensuring financial return.  Participatory design - how can we help business pivot to more sustainable operations and strategies? Pilots - field trials of selected innovations in suitable environments to demonstrate potential Proof of concept-  same as above Systems thinking - supporting businesses to think through what are the possible market entry points and new entry points considering the wider ecosystem. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. There is very little data on how new innovative businesses are thinking about sustainability. Some are focusing on, for example, sustainable innovation like renewable energy, however, are they considering the impacts of their operations and supply chains on people and planet? When they consider sustainable business strategies  - are they focusing on financial gain AND social and environmental responsibility? For example, is the farm supplying organic source material for biofuel production farming to reduce water consumption and land degradation, and paying fair wages to employees? If not, how easy is it to pivot to ensure suppliers are doing such things? This information/findings will help us frame how we support small businesses in future, and provide a gauge of how innovative businesses think about sustainability.  2. There are many early stage innovation business acceleration programmes - however what is stopping the   adoption/uptake of these businesses  towards accelerating national economic and employment growth? Through this project we aim to learn, from the horses mouth, the detailed challenges by following their journey through the programme.
