## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. There are still huge barriers facing those who are often “left behind” as they try to participate fully in Ghana’s innovation ecosystem. 

2. There is unconscious bias which leads to the same people populating the system. Young women, those from rural communities and PWDs have specific needs and things to offer which we often overlook. Things we take for granted – such as pitching – can be very difficult for these groups. 

3. It’s not always about the money – often what innovators require is advice about how to maximize the benefits from the innovation. 

4. We should look more at exploiting synergies between individual innovators/innovations and encourage greater collaboration. 

5. The handling of IP rights is still a problem when supporting young innovators.
