> Title of the innovation

website and service

> Brief description of the innovation

For over 12 years of primary and secondary education, i have observed how schools have implemented developmental projects some of which would not have been possible if it were not for a school's entrepreneural efforts put forth.
my innovation is inspired by these entrepreneural efforts, one secondary school in matero which i attend has been undertaking a development project of building a school hall.
     But as observed it was clear there was little or no funds to proceed with the construction after laying the foundation. The school started growing vegetables and created a fish pond to sale the fish and vegetables at a small scale. Looking at the unfinished school hall and a promising fish pond, the question became what if the school could sell its products at a large scale one day? i came up with the idea of creating a school website that would not only introduce the school from a business perception and  list what it offers for sale  but promote engagement between the school administration its learners and the public.  As part of my innovation the website's interactivity feature opens door for a service that is a secondary object of my business plan. 
   Inconclusion i have a website  prototype that has a planned set of features which would be of great benefit to the schools that i intend to partner with in this technology centered business. Aside from the website is a service which i believe will  go hand in hand with a school's objective of participating in entrepreneural activities.
Given the opportunity to be selected i'm more than willing to present my innovation in detail given the fact that i submitted my form in the last minute, which has robbed me of the time needed to put forth important points.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

A solid marketing plan written for the business  explains the viability of the innovation. And to disclose it here, the plan specifies how exactly the website and planned service to offered will generate income for me and patnering schools.
through marketing research i have identified target customers to be clients who are willing to advertise their products and services on the  website and those who subscribe to the service we will provide .
   A website if properly designed is well known to attract traffic on the site, and having spent three years in web development i can assure that the select features will attract traffic  to the website given the end users involved i.e learners who in turn attract the public.
   With a vision to grow, i intend to patner with more schools, so that together we can achieve the goal of delivering the primary objective of the business plan and that is the planned service together with the secondary objective which is the website.

> Technical Feasibility

Practicing web development for at least three years now, i can say that the site is feasible enough for launch. With the many technological tools developed over the years  to help developers meet requirements, the site will benefit from technologies such as (nodeJS a backend technology and react a front end technology developed by facebook).
Not forgeting the most important of latest technologies in web development which is cloud computing, which has changed a developer's perception of hosting  a networked application/website.
with cloud computing we wont have to worry about the underlaying infrustructure thus cutting costs to a great extent ,one thing favourable bor business.

> Anticipated Social Impact

JOB CREATION:
it is quite obvious that i wont be working alone, given the nature of the business one can only expect effectiveness and effeciency if the right people are employed to take part in the day to day running of the business.
INSPIRED YOUTHES TURNED INTREPRENEURS:
i certainly do hope that through the hardwork which patnering schools and i will invest in the business will be able to inspire my fellow youths to seek areas in which they can patner with us, so that they realize a vision that is inclusive of others thus promoting economic growth in the country.   
PATNERING SCHOOLS MEETING OBJECTIVES OF IMPLEMENTING DESIRED PROJECTS:
through this venture, another of my sincerest hopes is for patnering schools is be able to undertake developmental projects, because it will not only be about being patners in business but also providing online marketing tips that would be effective in helping to achieve the goal.
