## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Ramiz Uddin

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

01/01/2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Conservation of Saint Martin's Biodiversity by Securing Safe Hatching of the Environmentally Vulnerable Marine Turtles

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 100 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes. But the nesting populations of turtles have declined due to the severe exploitation of eggs and the illegal killing of adult turtles by fishing and other activities. Today, a few individual turtles' nest on the sandy beaches along the coast of Bangladesh including St. Martin’s Island which is one of the turtles’ prime nesting locations. It is reported that 35 Olive Ridley turtles were found nesting in one night in 1983. By 1996-98, however, the highest number of nesting turtles in one night was 15. But this has reduced to just two or three now. As small Island St. Martin's biodiversity is being destroyed day by day, it is unavoidable to protect the sea turtle by ensuing safe nesting for conserving the environment of the island.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

LQ1: Can the manmade process ensure the safe nesting and hatching of sea turtles?

LQ2: What should be the steps in sea turtle hatching at the hatchery of the Department of Environment in Saint Martin's?

LQ3: How to collect and preserve turtle eggs from the place where the mother turtle lay down the eggs?

LQ4: How to nurture and monitor the turtle eggs in the hatchery until the babies are hatched and released into the sea?

LQ5: Can the preservation of turtle eggs up to releasing the baby turtles make a big difference in the number of mother turtles coming to the beach?

LQ6: Can the conservation of turtle eggs in the hatchery protect them from being damaged by external components?

LQ7: What are the safer processes to release the Turtle Kids to the ocean water?

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning intent of the activity is to know how to preserve environmentally essential turtle eggs (hatching) for conserving the biodiversity of marine ecology in order to tackle the climate actions.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF environmentally critical turtle's egg can be preserved, THEN their reproduction rate will be increased significantly.

H2: IF the number of sea turtles can be enhanced, THEN it will impact positively to the environment by balancing the marine ecosystem.

H3: IF turtles' egg can be preserved at the conservation hatchery at St. Martin’s Island for safe nesting, THEN the rate to the releases turtle kids will be high which protects biodiversity of the Bay of Bengal.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Monitoring turtles from the time of coming to the land to lay eggs.

2. Collect the eggs from the beaches and then moved to the hatchery of Department of Environment.

3. Preserve the eggs in the hatchery covered with clean sand to a depth of 2 inches, and placed in the sand maintaining the temperature and humidity.

4. Collect the baby turtles after 70 to 80 days of hatching and release them to the seawater safely.

5. Use CC Camera for monitoring the hatchery and collect the baby turtles.

6. Manage the team to collect the eggs and protect the mother turtles.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1. Environmentally Vulnerable Sea turtles (Olive Ridley species) and their eggs.

2. Process of the collection and preservations.

3. Rate of baby turtles from the number of eggs.

4. Location wise eggs collections.

5. Research on effective process of the turtle eggs collection, proservation and baby turtle release.

6. Document learning compare to the previoous years.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

1. Observation (from laying place to hatchery), 2. Interview, 3. Participatory discussion, 4. Qualitative and Quantitative Data collection, 5. Mapping, 6. Drone based data collection, 7. Historical data collection, 8. Desktop research, 9. Field Survey, 10. Collect Geospecial data.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Non-monetary resources from UNDP projects: 1. Time allocation from teams; 2. Stakeholder Identification; 3. AHathcery selection from DoE 4. Equipment support; 5. Technical support and consultation from different stakeholders; 6. Advisory support from; 7. Technical support.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, the original hypothesis was proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology that was chosen for the experiment worked well for saving the turtle eggs. It also suggests that we can save many other species following the same methodology from annihilation.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

1250 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, this activity has a follow up stage. Now this will be followed up with the respective ministry and department to extend the area of the hatchery and develop a sustainable model for accommodating enough staffs to continue this process.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, after successfully piloting, the initiative is planned to scale up at different island of Bangladesh like - Sonadia Island
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

It was realized that turtles do not come on the island due to bright light, excessive noise and people's footprints. Therefore, we learned that we must aware the tourist and hotel motel owners about maintaining silence, proper lighting and limiting tourists' movements around the potential zones where turtles' lays eggs.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacles and challenges we encountered during the activity as follows:

1. Limited human resources to look for the turtles at night

2. No restriction of movements for tourists to allow the turtle to feel safe and come on the land to lay eggs.

3. Excessive noise throughout the island created by tourists.

4. Bright lighting on the beach to make the tourists feel safe.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Although this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit the whole island and the aquatic resources improving the ocean water quality.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Outside the UNDP, the island people and marine animals will be benefitted with the better water quality of the ocean.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

For replicating this initiative, the local context must be assessed. At first the threats have to be identified and then the experimentation with the solution has to be designed otherwise the intervention will not be successful.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this experiment can be replicated in another thematic area like climate change.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore phase influenced the shaping of full experimentation of the learning cycle. This is a different kind of experiment that was done to save the turtles of the island giving them safe places to lay eggs. Every year the number of turtles laying eggs were decreasing significantly. Sensing the depth of challenges, we have mapped the solution and explored the way out. Then piloted the experiment at the selected areas where turtles used to lay eggs.

> What surprised you?

It was surprising that, before piloting the experiment yearly only 2-3 turtles were found laying eggs since last few years but this year due to this intervention the number of turtles have increased. It made the turtles feel save to come on the island and lay eggs.
