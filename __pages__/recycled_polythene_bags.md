After the PET (transparent bottles) are collected, compressed and provided for recyclers, the plastic cover (high density plastic)  part of the bottle was left over and disposed illegally.  This recycling activity highly  reduces the amount of plastic waste disposed and contribute to reduce  pollution and create job opportunities for youth and women.
In this procedure the plastic (HDPE) waste is collected, it is cleaned with water and crushed and processed to plastic bag with different thicknesses. The other product of this waste is polythene bags/seedling pots which is used by city municipality for seedling raising purposes.
