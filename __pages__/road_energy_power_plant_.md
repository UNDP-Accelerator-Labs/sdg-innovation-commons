> Title of the innovation

ROAD ENERGY POWER PLANT.

> Brief description of the innovation

A Road energy power plant is a system designed to capture wasted kinetic energy from moving vehicles. The number of moving vehicles is increasing rapidly and if we can convert some of the kinetic energy of these vehicles into the rotational motion of generator then we can produce a considerable amount of electricity. 
 Electricity is one of the most widely forms of energy, today our whole life style is dependent on electricity. with the increasing population, the use of electric power is also increasing but we know that the resources to generate electricity are limited and this has lead to energy Crisis.
   During this scenario,we need to to generate electricity from the things used in day by day life. which will help us to generate electricity as vehicles pass through the speed breakers. 
THIS IS THE MAIN CONCEPT OF THIS INNOVATION.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

One of the most sources of income for Road energy power is the feed in tariff. however there are still several key sources of income for Road energy project that can make a project financially viable.
# EXPORT PRICE 
This is a payable for every Kwh of electricity exported to the national grid. under this arrangement, every Kwh generated by the system would be exported and the export rate would be be paid
The value proposition of modernizing electric power distribution grids rests in part on harnessing the control and communications capabilities of new energy generator, storage,derively and consumption technologies to offer a broad range of value-added electricity services to retail electricity customers.

> Technical Feasibility

Road power generation (R.P.G) is a system designed to capture wasted kinetic energy from moving vehicles.this device converts the kinetic energy of the vehicles into electric energy.this is done by moving plate installed on the road, this plate captures very small movements from the road surfaces and it transferes to a key way flywheel system. Once it reaches predetermined velocity, The (RPG) flywheel system has been developed to achieve large amount of movements of inertial in relatively small space. The captured energy is converted into electricity which is fed into power grid.
*The higher the frequency of passing vehicles provides high capacity.

> Anticipated Social Impact

*The Road energy power plant will create thousands job employment,to citizens in different parts of the country to be working as skilled and unskilled.
*Hence Load shedding has affected zambian economy due to climate change, hence this plant will generate electricity without hindered by climate change.
