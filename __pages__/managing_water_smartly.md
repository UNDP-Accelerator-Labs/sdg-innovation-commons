## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To explore the possibility of deploying a device that can make water management simple and efficient for both small and large scale users

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If water can be managed efficiently by those who have access to national supply then water wastage due to spillages in water tanks at small scale user levels can be saved/ recovered

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The first phase of the experiment is to build a prototype device that can efficiently manage tank water managment with no spillage and then the second phase will be installing the deveice at a second location under a different senario to learn more about user experience in therms of meeting the intentions of the hypothesis 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters measured: system failure & maintenance frequency; 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

 report logs

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time investment
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

partially as the phase one looks at the device's efficiency in managing water.The experiment site was at a location where natonal supply wasn't available but there were 2 of 3,000 litres opaque water tanks and a well that served as the water source rather than supply via national dam. The system was suppose to smartly manage the water flow into the tanks and  continously indicate water levels within te three enclosures at all time via the indicator board. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The CO uses prefinancing modality and 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

7 months but delay was from operations side in releasing tranche payment timely

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

1,500 usd

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes it does the follow up action as explained earlier is the deployment of the device now in a location that periodically have water supplied from the national source and get user experience information on the change fro the manual and traditional means of managing personal water reserves to the fully automated process.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The very first option for scaling will be putting the product out in the market for small to meduim scale opertional users to buy the product and have one less issue to worry about. The second option is for the largescale coorporate water supply entities especially for the Government to incoporate this solution in the dam managment process to help accurately indicate water levels that inturn can help them plan distribution better.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Water Management process was fully automated, the indicator board with a combination of percentage and colour codes made it more inclusive ot only for literate users . Finally the innovator needed more time in building specific components as these pieces aren't easily available in the local market 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

UNDP internal processes

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Sustainable Local and Economic Development Custer (SLED) as both Youth Entrepreneurship & Empowerment Programmes and water managements projects falls under this cluster they can support the scaling of the solution 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Every standard house in Sierra Leone has a water reserve system as a backup to those that have intermittent supply from national grid and those that don't have access. So there's a huge market for this solution just as the water tanks because now water management has been domesticated and the traditional methods do have their lapses but with this method those laspses have been addressed and thats one of the selling points of the solution. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

yes prior to deployment a few parts didn't work efficiently and therefore the innovatior had to build some of these parts himself

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

If the context is similar as it relates to water supply then this solution would be apt for use
