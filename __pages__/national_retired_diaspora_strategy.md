When asked, 70% of the Serbian diaspora is considering retiring to Serbia. The return of these retirees is an opportunity to build a new economic base with synergies with the existing local needs. Returning professionals at the end of their careers can benefit the economy with their skills, talents, and resources if they continue to work and after they retire.  The strategy would include programs such as “Landing Pads” (guides to retirement in Serbia), Age Friendly Communities, and subsidies for SMEs evolving around the “Golden Age Industry”.
