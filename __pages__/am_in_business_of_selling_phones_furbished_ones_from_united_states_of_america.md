> Title of the innovation

Am in business of selling phones furbished ones from United States of America

> Brief description of the innovation

Have been doing this business for more than five years now.Have got five workers whom we do work together in Luanshya at Art center and due to high rate of dollars we are failing to be ordering more phones and other gargets.Am the only one doing this business of original brands in Luanshya. If we shall have enabling environment our business can increase as have got enough market. Capital and affordable exchange rate of a dollar for sure we are able to expand in this business. My workers are less than 50 years and still have energy to expand our business

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Apart from selling of phones am also in family where am growing soya beans and maize for sale and consumption. If we can have enough capital for seeds,chemicals to grow more we can have big market within Zambia and we can also export. Maize nd soya beans are on demand but challenge is on the buyers as the Government buy at a lower price against high fertilizer,seeds and chemicals. The combined business can increase our capacity nd the community benefit as I have 4 workers in phone and have been engaging local community in Mkushi growing maize nd says beans which is a challenge again on the distance from Luanshya to Mkushi other wise many people benefit and its environment friendly when we talk about environmental damage

> Technical Feasibility

We are able to fix it if there shall be an enabling environment leveled by our Government as I do believe so much in them  to deliver nd fix damaged economy our country by the previous regime

> Anticipated Social Impact

Many people are able to be employed job creation, availability of food in their homes as from a small business of selling phones and peasant farmer to semi mid peasant employing a good number in the community and by doing so there shall be no poverty in the country if such opportunity can be to all provinces in our country
