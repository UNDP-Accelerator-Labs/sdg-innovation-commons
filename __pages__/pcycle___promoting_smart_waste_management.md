Pcycle is a social enterprise that is creating awareness, recycling and bringing smart solution to waste management. It is one of the winners of UNDP Bangladesh's Youth Colab grant.  Through their #wasteinmybag campaign, with UNDP Bangladesh, they are urging netizens to store daily used non biodegradable waste and show those on social media instead of littering on the streets. They are also creating handicraft from waste such as making jewelry and utencils from used plastic.
