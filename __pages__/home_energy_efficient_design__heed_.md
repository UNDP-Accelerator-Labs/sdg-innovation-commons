> Type of the Solution

Innovative

> Description of the solution

Developed at the University of Carlifonia, Los Angeles. Such tools as the HEED can help homeowners or designer to produce low-energy buildings. HEED shows graphics of how much energy and money and carbon you can save by trying various new design options or by making remodeling changes to a home. Furthermore, various other Passive Heating and Cooling options are available including ventilation, evaporative cooling, and passive solar heating. It is possible to add Photovoltaic Panels and Solar Hot Water Collectors. HEED can automatically download climate data for thousands of locations around the world.
