> Title of the innovation

Learning through animation and gaming in early child education.

> Brief description of the innovation

Moving images have proven to aid children understand concepts at a deeper level. The SABbunny innovation aims to bring learning of basic english and mathematics  for children in early childhood education including pre-school to grade 2 at primary level,  through a fun and interactive way. An animated instructor that aids children to learn the alphabet, new words and their meanings, count numbers, and solve basic mathematical problems. Combined with interactive gaming in between each lesson in the program, SABbunny also aims to address the challenge of children with ADHD by retaining their attention to learning through an interesting and fun way.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The SABbunny learning experience is intended to be distributed and accessed via a computer and/laptop. SAB Digital aims to implement SABbunny education with a mobile ict unit that runs in schools, mainly in rural areas. The mobile ict unit will help to bring the use of technology for learning in schools that do not have ict laps. Through SABbunny, children in rural schools will not only learn in a style that is suitable for their retaining of cognitive and language skills, but will also expose them to the use of computers. Living in a digital age, it is only right that every child in Zambia has an early introduction to digital platforms that will be the norm for operations and activities for many years to come, phasing out manual processes.
SABbunny so far has been a self funded project, by SAB Digital Technologies CEO using personal monthly wages. SABbunny is intended for the delivery of free digital learning to children in rural areas and does not prospect to charge families in the described populated areas. However, the main monetization plan, would be through advertising. By creating banner space at the bottom of the SABbunny program that can be used as advertising space, SABbunny wishes to approach organizations and companies with products that are aimed that the population in rural areas. A number of brands have been identified such as mobile service providers and hygen products such as soaps, just to mention but a few.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed through flash and action script, a coding language that has been used to develop animations and games in  developed countries in the last generation. Flash action script has been selected due to its relatively esdy to use and easy to implement nature. Products designed through flash can be exported via multiple platforms, one of the easiest being html embabed. SABbunny is designed as a link to opem on any internet browser to commence a childs learning experience. It does not require internet connectivity and can be accessed offline. The prototype that is available consists of the animation for the english alphabet and maths numbers. It also includes the interactive game to feature in between lessons. As an MVP, we feel that SABbunny can be expanded, however, our main focus is to present a simple yet fun way for the children in rural areas to learn language, counting and cognitive skills im a fun way.

> Anticipated Social Impact

SABbunny combines learning with gaming that address the challenge of children with ADHD by retaining their attention to learning through an interesting and fun way. SABbunny will expose digital learning to children in rural areas, meaning, exposure to computers, and ultimately inspiring interest in education and technology at an early age.
