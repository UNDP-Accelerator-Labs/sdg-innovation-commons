> Description of the solution

The Platform for Automated extraction of animal Disease Information from the web (PADI-web) is an automated biosurveillance system devoted to online news source monitoring for the detection of emerging/new animal infectious diseases by the French Epidemic Intelligence System. The tool automatically collects news via customised multilingual queries, classifies them and extracts epidemiological information. PADI-web pipeline involves six steps ranging from online news collection to the extraction of epidemiological features: data collection, data processing, data classification, sentence classification, information extraction, user notification. This strategy has been used in the implementation of several projects at national and European levels (see their website).
