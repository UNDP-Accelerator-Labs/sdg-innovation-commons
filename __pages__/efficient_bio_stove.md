> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Purpose:  Most people in rural areas of Assam have been facing various difficulties in the cooking meal at their kitchen. Generally, firewood is being used as a primary source of fuel. However, due to ignorance and also by adaptive culture, a huge amount of heat energy goes waste during cooking. The innovator Khanindra came up with an idea of developing a tool with which the problem can be solved by sustainable utilization of the energy where heat can be restored and he succeeded to develop this stove after many trials. Technical details: This is a bi-chambered innovative bio-stove separated by a metallic circular plate from one chamber to the other, The upper chamber is meant for putting fuel source in it. A dome-shaped metallic burner with an opening on the top is being placed on the upper fuel chamber which checks the airflow from outer surroundings. Then the stove is placed above the burner. Above the whole arrangement, a circular metallic plate is placed that protects the heat release from the firewood. Once the fire sets than other bioresources such as cow dung, unused wood materials, etc. are added into the existing fuel resources. This bio-stove has the provision of temperature control and this is achieved by using various setup combinations and also by air control regulator provided beneath the combustion chamber. The lower chamber is meant for collecting ashes released from the burnt biomaterial. The size and shape of the burners vary and can be used according to need.  Benefits: The stove has some novel features which can be advantageous in terms of working efficiency as well as better cooking control with air regulation arrangement and various attachments.
