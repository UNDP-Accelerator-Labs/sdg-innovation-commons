Low nutrition levels have been observed particularly among children and women. Further, there has been growing numbers of patients with chronic diseases which require a well supplemented nutritional diet. This is made worse by the increased working hours that people engage in due to economic hardships. People then resolve to consuming junk foods which are unhealthy. On the other hand, most of the nutritious local raw materials are exported to other countries and are later sold on the Zambian market as expensive finished products.

Joyous Food Processors developed a porridge formulation, made from a combination of millet, soya beans, sorghum, rice, groundnuts and maize that can be consumed by people of all ages and of diverse economic status. The promoter believes people are what they eat. Nutrition does not mean satisfying hunger only but having a balance of nutrients and vitamins in order to promote physical and mental wellbeing. The Fumpi flour makes a porridge that ensures that people have a balanced diet and live healthier lives.
