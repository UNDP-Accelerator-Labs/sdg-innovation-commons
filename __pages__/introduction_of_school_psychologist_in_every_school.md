> Title of the innovation

Introduction of school psychologist in every school

> Brief description of the innovation

Mental health issues are quite pervasive among the students in the contemporary age. Changes in the education system and the advancement of educational practices have increased the competition level. Students find it challenging to keep up with the frequently changing practices and can succumb to the peer pressure caused by them. This peer pressure can also cause several negative impacts on the mental health of the students. They feel anxiety-ridden, stressed, and in severe cases, depressed. 
Often, the teachers and parents are incapable of recognizing the mental health problems in their children. These issues are not even acknowledged as severe problems. Lack of support and guidance from the parents and teachers can make the situation worse for many students, and they feel stressed and anxious. 
Psychologists are the best candidates to help the education system deal with such barriers which in turn would improve the academic performance of the pupils.
