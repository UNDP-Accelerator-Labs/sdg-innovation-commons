> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The company makes fuel pellets from biodegradable waste (e.g., spent coffee grounds, coffee husks, sawdust, wood chips, khat stems). Using pellets as a fuel source in gasifier cookstoves is superior to any other solid biomass because pellets are uniform in size, have low moisture content, have a high energy density, and are easier to transport and store. When these pellets are burned in fan-forced gasifier stoves, they turn into biochar (i.e., charcoal).
