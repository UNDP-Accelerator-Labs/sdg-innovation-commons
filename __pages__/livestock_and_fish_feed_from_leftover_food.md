Kaseb Al Shakhanbeh is testing the use of leftover food from local shops (like a cake shop) to make cheap feed for fish and livestock in his farm (which includes a fish farm). He saw this idea being tested in the West Bank, Palestine and decided to try it himself. What he is learning:  - This is saving him money in the operations of his own farm.   - The livestock feed has  shown to increase the percentage of protein in the animals to 40% (before it was 15%). This means he can sell the livestock for a higher price.  He is now testing this same approach for fish feed to see if it yields the same results.  - He is also trying tell the feed  to other farmers in winter because at that time of year there is no fresh grass so there is demand for the feed. He's selling a bag (not sure about weight) for 6 Jordanian Dinars per, which he says is good because it costs him zero JD to make the feed. Process of making the livestock feed: He takes leftover food from local shops for free Dries the food. Some foods need fermentation to get rid of toxinsC Crushes and mixes the different foods Adds corn to it Leaves it for 12 hours -3 days  Process of testing the fish feed: Take leftover food and dry it Type of food: meat from chicken, bones, protein sources, melt , crushed, Shapes it into circles  Challenges he faced: Needs hangar or caravan that is shielded from the sun and sanitized, which he can't afford. Currently using a tent which is not as hygienic. No tools to do it -having tools would make process faster. Using current method, 25 kilo per day, 3 people, 8 hours  With tools, you could make 4 times the amount   Not enough storage area. Currently storing by covering with fabric on wood so a good proportion goes to waste.
