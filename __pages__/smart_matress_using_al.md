> Description of the solution

The smart mattress uses Al to cool the bed. The smart mattress known as 'the Pod', consists of six layers, designed to improve sleep through thermoregulation. The Pod contains flexible and contoured grid into which temperature-regulated water is pumped from a separate water tank. The tank dupped 'the Hub' sits by the side of the bed and cools water using 'thermo-electric cooling elements in conjunction with a Heat Sink and two premium cooling fans like those found in upscale gaming P.Cs. The temperature of the water is adjusted using sensors
