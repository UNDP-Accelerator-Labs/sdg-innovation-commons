## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Agricultural Mechanization
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that despite Malawi being an agro-based economy, mechanization of the sector is very limited which to a larger extent inhibits growth of the sector, particularly in crop production.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Agriculture is the main driver of the economy of Malawi, contributing 22.6% of the country’s GDP and accounting for over 60% of total export earnings in 2021. Agriculture also remains the main contributor to food and nutrition security in the country. The sector accounted for 76.4 percent of total employment in 2019. Although Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, it remains one sector with low inclusion of technology to improve efficiency in prioritised value chains particularly production. Majority of farmers still use the hoe as a primary tool for land cultivation.  

This is due to lack of innovation in the sector, particularly leveraging on locally driven technologies, limited policy implementation in supporting adoption of new technologies and limited business models for Agricultural commercialisation. 

This has led to stagnation of the economy and slow recovery of farmers from natural disasters.

The review of the 2016 National Agriculture Policy places agriculture mechanisation as one of the priority areas for the next 5 years from 2024.  

Pillar 1 of the Malawi 2063 vision is Agriculture Productivity and Commercialisation. The first 10-year implementation plan of this national development blueprint indicates several prioritised national interventions for this pillar which include, adoption of technologies. 

The National Research Agenda 2023 also places Agriculture Mechanisation as a key focus area for research and development.

Mentions of its prioritization in social media, development meetings and events as well as the President's State of the National Address (SONA) 2023 quoted below: 

It goes without saying that we cannot transform our economy without revitalizing our primary sector of Agriculture, and this must go beyond social protection programmes like AIP [Agricultural Inputs Programme]. What we are pushing for is Agricultural mechanisation, commercialisation and Industrialization.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This is a key area for the country's development and AccLab is well placed to provide the platform for diverse stakeholder engagement to draw out interests, pool resources and knowledge for action.

The new R&D function imbedded in the Lab propels our Accelerator Lab to explore the challenge in depth and identify new areas for the CO investment/intervention.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Accelerator Lab is exploring Malawi's capacity to develop technologies for improving efficiency in crop production for local farmers, who still rely on the archaic hoe for cultivation, to help the country grow its economy.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Does Malawi have the capacity to develop technologies for Agricultural crop production?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?
