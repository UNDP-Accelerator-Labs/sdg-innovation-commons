Guinean Association for Sanitation and Environmental Protection is an NGO based in the region of Gabu. The main goal of the association is to manage solid waste around the city of Gabu. They go a step further by recycling the materials and making them into items which can be used in the household. The income from items sold allows for the volunteers to have a form of income, which largely consist of youth. They organise monthly clean-ups to keep Gabu clean.  They often get together to discuss ways in which they can make the work sustainable, but offering to collect waste from shop owners directly for a small fee of 200 francs a month, but due to lack of government backing, this plan has not worked.
