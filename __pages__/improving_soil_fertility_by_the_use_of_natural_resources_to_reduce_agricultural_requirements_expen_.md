> Title of the innovation

Improving soil fertility by the use of natural resources to reduce agricultural requirements expenditure.

> Brief description of the innovation

This is the method of the manufacture of  organic manure instead of using artificial fertilizer. We make this manure using tree leaves and grass. We first dig a pit of about 1.5 metres according to the size of your field and then we put a layer of some leaves in the pit and a layer of some soil on top, then there comes a layer of some grass and then soil on top of the grass. And we put another layer of leaves and soil on top of a layer of leaves and another layer of grass and add soil on top. After all this, what follows now is watering everyday to make the grass and those branches to decompose easily. We do this for 3-4 months for the organic fertilizer to be ready for use. After this method of reducing farmer's expenditure then we have also to take a step of teaching farmers about crop rotation.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will surely help me and others in generating income in such a way that farmers will have no need to spend much money in farming but just their strength and strategic plans. So as I earlier mentioned, this innovation will have to Carter the whole country or the world at large where farming is concerned. By so doing, we will reduce farming budget and increase farming produce and supply will be enough in the country even economic growth will be supported.

> Technical Feasibility

For this innovation to be implemented, many people are required country wide so that this must be taught to each and every farmer. This good method of improving soil fertility will not only help them reduce their expenditure but also will keep on improving the soil year by year. Am a farmer and l have been doing this for some years now so this have been designed to extend the skill to many farmers. This will also lessen the pressure for farmers in our beautiful county called Zambia and will improve farming productivity. So by doing this we will involve ourselves in the restoration of  our country's economy.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will really improve the lives of many farmers because what brings set back among farmers is lack of enough funds to buy farming inputs. So through this method, they will be well able to grow the crops of their choice to sustain their families. This will also improve and increase farming produce on the Zambia's market.
