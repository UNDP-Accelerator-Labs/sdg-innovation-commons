> Title of the innovation

Peersnest

> Brief description of the innovation

Peersnest is a multi- purpose online platform ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. Peersnest bridges information and knowledge gap so that low-income learners and differently abled have the same opportunities as high-income learners. The entire learning system takes place online, allowing us to overcome geographic and logistical barriers that have impeded the effectiveness of education and dissemination of information and skills in Zambia and Africa at large. The platform provides inclusive learning courses (subjects) under the Examination Council of Zambia (ECZ) curriculum and extracurricular courses outside the scope of the education governing body but are valuable to the learners and community at large. The platform is aimed at reducing the learning inequality that has existed between high class and lower class.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Peersnest revenue model include:
i.	PRODUCTS: The platform will sell other value added learning and reading materials like text books, novels and research materials though a markup model. 
ii.	PAID COURSES: Other than providing free basic learning, Peersnest will sell other high level courses to the public. 
iii.	DONATIONS:  Peersnest will raise donations primarily through our "Sponsor a learner" program. The program enables donors to finance learners that are under their organization.
iv.	SUBSCRIPTION: For extra features like online library and other value added services Peersnest will charge and additional affordable fee. 
v.	ADVERTS: Peersnest will sell advertising space through the free tutorials and the social interaction pages.
vi.	PARTNER REVENUE: Peersnest will partner with organizations that advocate and provide education and the Ministry of Education. 
Peersnest is delivering its services to the youth, adolescents and general public that can benefit from the services.
The prize money will aid in acquiring, buy equipment (Computers and other peripherals), cover operational expense (internet, hosting, communication, rent and salaries). The funds will also help Peersnest develop a more inclusive and robust mobile application. Furthermore, the aid will facilitate penetration into our target market through branding, advertising and marketing.

> Technical Feasibility

Peersnest is a web based platform that can be accessed by anyone connected to the internet. For convenience, Peersnest is currently providing a progressive application which the users can easily add to home screen and use. 
The current website and progressive application developed with WordPress a content management system (CMS). This system is integrated to a payment gateway (FlutterWave) and Learning Management System (LMS.
We plan to implement Peersnest in a phased manner so as to track our progress as well as utilize our market response and risk management in line with our strategy.
i.	Phase One (in progress): Developing the website and progressive application and addition the learning materials (Tutorials, live classes and reading materials) for grade one to twelve.
ii.	Phase Two:  Partnering with relevant organizations and local authority to facilitate our market reach.
iii.	Phase Three: Adding more services and courses to the platform that will enhance our goal of providing an inclusive platform
iv.	Phase Four: Developing a more inclusive web and mobile application with a more advanced features that will be inclusive

> Anticipated Social Impact

The educational benefit to society for a program like Peersnest is highly substantial. Not only does it provide intangible benefits in the form of increased exposure to diversity of information access to learning materials, but also to society in the form of economic benefit through job creation for the young people especially a huge pull of unemployed teachers. Furthermore, by being a safe digital space to access learning materials and socialize, we increasing the access to education services which is primarily increasing the access to information and skills.
The niche in this proposal is very relevant to the current market as it explores an area in the market that has been tapped into but has not being fully explored and is able to stand test time as it rides on numbers of young people who are currently the target learning group and are majority of the population. 
In an advent of reducing learning inequality that has been in existence and creating an inclusive learning platform, Peersnest will integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will aid the learning of differently abled.
