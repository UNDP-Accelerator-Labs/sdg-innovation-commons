## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.      Exploratory discussions and subsequent field survey covering more than 1000 respondents with the local community representatives in two target districts of Syrdarya and Dzijjak Regions confirmed our initial hypothesis that the approach used to provide public services via a centralized office space in urban settings need to be adapted for the remote rural areas. In particular, the new approach should address the challenges of regularity of mobile units visit to the remote areas, which are not sufficient, the range of services offered, which are substantially less than in urban centers mainly due technical problems (Internet connectivity, access to database, availability of office equipment), staffing challenges, challenges with payment, and absence of methodological framework for provision and management of complex services via mobile offices; 1.      Introduction of a personas tool on real users of public services allowed all stakeholders – Agency of Public Services, research institute under the Agency and community to understand different needs, goals, behaviors, and attitudes towards ‘mobile’ offices. Identification four personas, representing various age, profession, and background for each of two target regions instead of ‘averaging’ the needs of remote communities, allowed to discuss various design options for public service delivery. 2.      The survey and in-depth discussions results showed that quality of services was high for simple and basic services offered via mobile offices, whereas quality of a more complex services need further improvements. At the same time these simple and basic services can be accessed by citizens by themselves via the Government portal for public services without the need to visit ‘mobile’ offices. However, the general public is not aware of this option.   3.      More targeted awareness raising activities at the community level are needed to increase the utilization of mobile office services; the potential of existing in/formal networks for communicating information about public services (such as Telegram channels, ‘bazaar’ days and ‘makhalla’ (community) centers) needs to be utilized;   4.      Uptake of digital services and usage of Government portal is slow due to preference of face-to-face interaction with public employee.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1.      Due to a spread of COVID19 and imposed travel limitations, caused a delay with conducting field surveys 2.      There is a gap in demand and supply of public services due to low level of awareness of mobile office service offer: people don’t know about service and hence don’t demand, while mobile offices/units don’t receive requests for services hence do not see the point for visiting remote areas.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

No data (time spent for obtaining service, level of satisfaction, availability, and accessibility of most needed services) were available on the quality of public service delivery and usage. Usage of in-depth interviews allowed to use personas tool for designing the services. Other data such as demographic breakdown of customers, the geographical distribution of users, potential demand analysis (based on location and demographic data), availability of social objects (schools, etc.) allowed to develop interventions for improving the public service delivery.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The idea of delivery public services with mobile units was taken from best international practice, but its implementation lacked necessary elements that made those mobile units successful. In particular, the solution was introduced following a top-down approach without consultations with users. Moreover, mobile unit were designed uniformly for all regions, despite big differences in socio-economic parameters among remote rural communities. The schedule of mobile units visits of the community were developed based on limited capacity of the Public Service Centers without consultation with the needs of local communities.
