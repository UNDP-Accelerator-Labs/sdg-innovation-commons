## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Legal aid way finding creating a pre service way finding phase for beneficiaries who may need legal aid services. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that with the Lebanese crisis in its third year the judicial system is in a catatonic state making access to basic legal advice or services a luxury to very few and most legal services inactive even for those with money. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

UNDP has rolled out a free "legal aid" office across three key areas in Lebanon, the office reports indicate little use in some areas, a steep incline to one gender in another, and a misunderstanding of what is on offer. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

While the need for Legal Aid can be clear, the concept of "legal aid" is not for many in Lebanon. The current crisis does not help, however the occasion allowed us to question how we deliver services and if there are ways we can prepare people and share knowledge in ways that makes them agents of choice informing and allowing them to find their way to exactly the right service they need, especially as institutions crumble. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Do u need a lawyer? a mediator? a notary? or maybe what you are looking for is just a document. With an almost unofficial freeze on judicial service delivery in Lebanon, "Legal aid services" are free in 3 locations; learning about services allows users to also learn their rights.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

in times of crisis and overloaded systems can sharing knowledge with users be a way to create leaner sectoral services and allow access for wider groups of people to Legal services? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We used an MVP approach to a legal way finding experience on our site and a digital funnel to measure clicks and topics of interest as well as intent. This creates awareness but also share of mind and allows for a way to validate our hypothesis or experiment that giving people information would reduce the amount of people using the hot line or would direct the right people with the right ask to said hotline. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Right now we measure legal service delivery by how many people call or go to the service site, however with this type of service there are many layers and ways to how a person can benefit and accordingly a "pre service experience" will allow us to add metrics to things like "topics of interest" / "intent"  / "needs verified" 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

over 68,000 people landed on the legal aid guide and more than 6000 had the "intent" to call. We believe such clarity in need finding and validation is a fundraising tool.
