The English - Siswati manual aims to solve the language barrier between non-siswati speakers and native speakers when it comes to communication especially tourists who come into the country to explore the Kingdom of Eswatini with the interests in culture, tradition, tourist attraction areas and most importantly learning a new language, in this case being the Siswati language. The manual sets to translates over 3000+ English words that are translatable in Siswati. Non siSwati speakers will have the pleasure of learning basic Siswati words for communication purposes. Since most tourists are unfamiliar to the Swati language and culture, they will get an opportunity to learn about different Siswati words, basic Siswati sentences, traditional regalia, Swazi cuisine etc. This way non Siswati speakers, tourists or not will learn more about the Kingdom of Eswatini and broaden the language spectrum. The product will come in the form of a hard copy handbook/manual at first and then progress to be in a digital form (Soft copy or an app) depending on the target market's demand. It is going to cater for both digital users and people who prefer hardcopy manuals. This manual will put Eswatini on the map help develop the Siswati language and culture. The project is looking forwarding to engaging with the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, as a key stakeholder to realizing this project.
