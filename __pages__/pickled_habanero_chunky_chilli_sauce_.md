> Brief description of the innovation

For a people with such a colorful culture, I was surprised at how difficult it was to find a chilli sauce with enough zing to satisfy the people's love for both heat and flavor, a problem my partners and I chose to take upon ourselves. 

We dedicated time to developing a recipe that wouldn't leave the consumer craving more heat nor flavor, maintaining a perfect balance between the two. We chose to use indigenous habanero chillies for their taste, heat level and largely because of their sweet scent to make our sauce.

In the development phase, we handed out samples to the public and altered the flavor according to the feedback we got until we felt we had a product that satisifed the public's desires.

Lastly we had to figure out a way to extend the shelf life without drastically altering neither the heat nor the taste, which we managed to accomplish.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We believe our has the potential to flourish into into a million kwacha company, employing many and continuously growing all while servicing the lives of Zambian people. At maximum capacity the company would facilitate a profitable network between chilli farmers, packaging companies, general workers and the consumers.

The challenge prize would help to speed up our growth and would facilitate the upgrade of machinery and gradual hiring of workers. It would also increase the amount of chilli we would buy from farmers, spreading the commercial network we are already I. The process of developing.

With time, we plan on growing our own chilli and experiment with different types of indigenous chilli to try and bring more flavor and quality product to the public nation wide.

> Technical Feasibility

Our chilli sauce is pickled and sealed with airlocks for a period of 3 weeks to 6months depending on the desired flavour. It Is also accompanied by preservatives and other flavoring ingredients.

We currently are at a production capacity of 50-100 jars a week production capacity, which is due to machinery limitations and availability of chilli which can be overcome by more funding.

We plan on upgrading machinery with time and increasing production which will then require gradual hiring of workers to assist with the increasing work load.

> Anticipated Social Impact

After our product has interacted and been circulated within the public, we have reveivwd overwhelming feedback and we have been reassured that our product is definitely something the public has been missing. There was a gap in the market and we found a way to fill it, and with your help we will be able to do more with more efficiency.

I would like to thank you for considering our innovation for the national innovative initiative prize and we look forward to working with you in the near future.
