Small scale farmers lack information regarding weather and rainfall patterns to plan for their farming activities. An agricultural management and monitoring system to collect data from the environment, processes and stores it on a data base for aggregation. This information guides farmers on how to resolve crop problems and to increase productivity. The system is also designed to be integrated with an online platform where small scale farmers can advertise their produce online.
