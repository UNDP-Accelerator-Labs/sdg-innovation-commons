Description: Rock or mineral wool can retain large amounts of water and air that aid root growth and nutrient absorption in hydroponics; Its fibrous nature also provides a good mechanical structure to keep the plant stable. The naturally elevated pH of mineral wools makes them initially unsuitable for plant growth and requires "conditioning".

Rockwool is usually used only in the seedling phase or with freshly cut clones, but can remain with the base of the plant throughout its life.
