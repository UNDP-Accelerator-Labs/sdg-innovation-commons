Improve youth employment opportunities through entrepreneurship 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in Sierra Leone often one of the viable options of employment for young men and women is Entrepreneurship, however, there are factors hindering this pursuance, these include among others, entrepreneurship sector largely informal; limited access to finance; limited entrepreneurship capacity; lack of competitiveness; and inadequate support systems to foster/scale innovative business ideas.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Sierra Leone is among countries in the world with high poverty rates largely attributed to the different crises that the country has undergone over the last 2 decades namely, a civil war and Ebola. The country is however steadily recovering but it’s still faced with a several development challenges. Sierra Leone’s Human Development Index is one of the lowest in the world at 0.452 and in 2019 it was ranked 182 out of 189 countries (Human Development Report, 2020). 64.8% of the population in Sierra Leone were multidimensionally poor in 2019 (Multidimensional Poverty Index, 2019).  The total population was estimated at 7.9 Million by mid-2020 (UN Data). Youth aged 15 – 35 years account for 34% of the total population.  There is high unemployment especially amongst youth and women, approximately 67% of youth population are unemployed (Statistics Sierra Leone, 2019). A considerable number of young people especially those in urban areas are in cliques/gangs and are prone to substance abuse thus not productive. Young women face different forms of marginalization and violations including exclusion from participating in development activities and they often have limitations to demonstrate innovation. (UN Youth at Risk Assessment Report, 2019). Young men and women are disappointedly faced with challenges including limited livelihoods options and opportunities, limited access to productive resources (land, capital, and infrastructure for growth), and are inadequately prepared for the labour market. Coupled with Skills Mismatch whereby institutions supplying more who are not absorbed by the labour market, the young people are inadequately prepared for the labour market. About 86% of the labor force is self-employed. COVID-19 has further exacerbated the situation with youth and women more affected, their businesses have scaled down or closed implying loss of source of income and livelihood, jobs have been lost and there are fewer opportunities than before (Assessment of the Socio-Economic impact of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone, 2020).
