> Title of the innovation

Integrated Approach to Children Good Health and wellbeing in Highly densely populated urban and villages

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will be three fold focusing mainly on children's' wellbeing in densely populated areas referred to as compounds as well as in villages. Firstly, it will involve developing sports infrastructures by collaborating with schools, churches and other institutions that have sports grounds in compounds for developing the areas into quality sports standards infrastructures. In villages land is still abundant, meaning land acquisition will be easy. 
Secondly, in order to ensure full participation of children in both compounds and villages, water provision will be paramount knowing that water drawing is one of the main activities at household level that preoccupies the children. To achieve this, it will require sinking of water boles powered by solar energy as well taping water from water supply companies. In compounds, water kiosks will made available at sports facilities and other nearby for easy access of water by children while in villages pipes water to community village points for drawing water 
Thirdly, after full development of the two above, food banks will be critical in order to enhance the nutrition status of the children as well as prevent them getting involved in chores for food.

All the three projects will be managed as a combo because they will mainly revolve around the sports grounds with the permanent structures.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The improved sports ground in compound will result in promoting sports academies in various sports disciplines and these academies will be paying for using facilities. In addition to academies, other community members will be using the facilities on paying fees basis.
This will be run in partnerships with schools or any other institutions that would offer space for development.

The water supply systems will be achieved through community participation and agreements and the fees will be paid all water drawn from the kiosks. Villages will be encouraged to pay using cash crops with high market value in urban areas. Modalities to achieve this will be agreed with communities.
 
The food banks will be based on paying minimal fees for accessing the foodstuffs as most of the foods will be mobilized from shopping malls, restaurants and other well wishers. The project would require movable containers for foodbanks. The fee will sustain the operations and retain some surplus.

The target market will be residents of the compounds and  villages. The business will likely to grow steadily knowing the initial investment will definitely be substantial  but thereafter costs will extremely be minimal which will result in the investment being profitable. 
 
There will be general social well of the communities that will benefit from the project, especially children. All projects highlighted above are climate friendly, no pollution involved.

> Technical Feasibility

Technical Feasibility:

Sports Grounds:
Indicates that the implementation of the projects have no barriers because the projects aims at improving lives in compounds and villages through collaboration with the local authorities.
In order to technically achieve the development of the sports grounds it will involve first and foremost secure space in villages and compounds.
The sports rounds will be designed in such a way to accommodate milt sports discipline. This will involve landscaping, construction of perimeters wall fences, water reticulation around the facilities.
Qualified labor to standards of construction engineers, architects, quantity surveyors.
Heavy Equipment will be required to transport gravel, dig, level, compact the areas.

Water supply;
The supplied water that will be accessed by the communities  will be linked to the sports grounds. Technically it will involve surveying for water sources through Department of water Affairs. Hire of drilling machines which includes casings, labor and transportation.
Lining of poly pipes , construction of kiosks, taps.  fees collection booths
FoodBanks
These will be movable to cater for sports grounds and ceremonies on commercial basis. All what is required is a container and a simple trainer that can be  hooked by any car.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will impact the communities in which it will be implemented positively by providing clean water and sports amenities in the compounds and villages. Talents will be identified from the children and it can help their livelihoods . Food will be provided at the cheapest possible prices in order to cater for all the children. In villages payments in kind for participation in sports grounds will promoted in form of cassava, groundnuts, maize and many other cash crops that have commercial viability in urban areas.
