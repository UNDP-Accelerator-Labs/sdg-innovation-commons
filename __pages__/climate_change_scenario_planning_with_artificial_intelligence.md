## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning intent of the activity is to explore how artificial intelligence can be utilized to engage citizens in the process of scenario planning, with a focus on understanding the drivers of social cohesion in Panama. By leveraging AI to generate visual representations of future scenarios related to climate change, the activity aims to foster active participation, gather diverse perspectives, and identify key factors that influence social cohesion within the community.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If artificial intelligence is used to facilitate participatory scenario planning around climate change impacts, then it will enhance citizens' understanding of the drivers of social cohesion and promote more active and inclusive participation in democratic processes.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test our hypothesis regarding the impact of using generative artificial intelligence in engaging citizens in climate scenario planning, we implemented a structured approach during the workshop. First, participants used Urbanist AI's interactive platform to input their ideas and concerns related to climate scenarios. Second, we processed these inputs using AI algorithms to generate real-time visualizations of how climate scenarios could affect their local environments. Lastly, we conducted a post-workshop survey to measure participant engagement levels and assess their perceptions of the effectiveness of using AI for civic engagement and scenario planning. These actions allowed us to evaluate whether AI-driven visualizations could effectively enhance citizen participation in discussing and planning for climate change impacts.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis for this experimental activity is the individual participants, specifically the students from the Technological University of Panama who are engaged in the participatory workshop. We will focus on their responses, the diversity of perspectives they provide, and their interactions with the AI-generated scenarios. This includes analyzing their feedback, level of engagement, and the themes and patterns that emerge from their contributions during the workshop.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Strengths:

Engagement: The use of AI-generated images based on participant inputs has shown to significantly increase engagement and participation levels.

Inclusivity: The methodology allows for a diverse range of perspectives to be visualized and considered, which is crucial for understanding complex social issues like climate change and social cohesion.

Innovative Visualization: AI-generated visualizations make abstract and complex ideas more tangible, facilitating better understanding and discussion among participants.

Areas for Improvement:

Technical Accessibility: Ensuring that all participants are comfortable with and have access to the necessary technology (smartphones, QR codes) is crucial. Technical difficulties can hinder participation and data collection.

Contextual Relevance: The AI's ability to generate contextually relevant images based on local realities could be enhanced. This would ensure that the visualizations resonate more with the participants' lived experiences.

Depth of Analysis: While AI can generate images and identify themes, deeper qualitative analysis of the discussions and feedback could provide richer insights.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 weeks

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

The cost of using the platform Urbanist AI 

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, the same technology will be used in another set of workshops with the Technological University of Panama with a different methodology. All the information should be used in the national HDR.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

So far, this experiment has not been planned to scale since we are testing a methodology (using AI) to engage citizens participation.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity
