## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Work and Self-reliance through Tourism in Madaba
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

A challenge is that unemployment rate is high in Jordan, and people are growing less capable of providing their basic needs, the prices of goods and services keep going up, and having a decent life is becoming more challenging especially for youth, women, and people with disability.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Multiple factors have historically and still contributed to this challenge. There is a mismatch between university specialisations and job market needs. Most entry-level jobs require at least two years of experience, making it difficult for youth to join the labour market. The prevalence of shame culture regarding certain professions which end up being filled by foreign labour and illegal refugees. The disruptions in the region and continuous unsuitability. Labour rights and wages could be better. The living expenses are going higher, and income is not increasing proportionally. The COVID pandemic still affects the community. All adults in Jordan are concerned, including the government, NGOs, the private sector, academia, the informal economy, and community members. There is a growing gap in trusting the government because of the implications on the community's livelihoods, affecting all aspects of life, including political participation of the youth in parties and elections.

In 2021, the Mababa governorate recorded the highest unemployment rate in Jordan at 28.3 per cent (Department of Statistics). A little less than a quarter of a million people live in Madaba. Research published by UN Women in September 2021 included participants from Madaba. It reported that 45 per cent of the respondents said that at least one person in their family lost their job during/after COVID. Most of which were women and people working informally. According to the Ministry of Tourism in Jordan, in 2019, Madaba received the second-highest number of tourists (along with Jerash), around 467K  out of 4.5 million visitors who spent at least one night in Jordan. Comparatively, Petra received 1.1 million visitors in the same year. Madaba's central location should encourage more visitors to include it in their itinerary. It is close to the capital Amman, to the Dead Sea, which is also a popular tourist destination. In 2019 and 2021, Madaba was the least-visited destination by local tourists, with less than 1500 people.  These are examples of the pressing need and an excellent opportunity to explore how to improve tourism projects in Madaba to create more work and self-reliance for its residents.

Madaba was named the Arab Tourism Capital for 2022 by the Arab Tourism Organisation. In April 2022, a Member of the Jordanian Parliament approached the Resident Representative seeking support to improve tourism in Madaba. The Accelerator Lab team was exploring water, agriculture, and work as its frontier challenge. Madaba was one of the governorates suggested by the people we interviewed. In mid-May, during a consultation with the government of Jordan, the General Secretary of the Ministry of Planning confirmed Jordan's priority to be youth employment and improving tourism in addition to water scarcity.  The team set on several activities, including sentiment analysis of TripAdvisor, Radio mining, immersion trips, interviews, and a tourist experience experiment; the trends noticed were: Madaba is of the least visited sites by local tourists. Petra is the most visited by all tourists. Arab tourists are the highest number of tourists visiting Jordan. Madaba governorate has the highest unemployment rate in Jordan, 28.3%.  Alternative tourism in Madaba is overlooked, as tourist guides and offices are comfortable with traditional tours. Local guides in Madaba have the challenge of licensing, which is expensive and requires language skills. Cooperation is not noted between the tourist and local guides. Tourists are interested in stories related to historical sites. Madaba is missing from the UNDSS Jordan Hotel List, which lists hotels in different locations and categorizes them based on level of safety. UN staff are required to use only hotels in this list that UNDSS approves, or a security assessment must be done for any hotel not approved. Tourism products and experiences throughout Jordan do not "wow" visitors or go above and beyond to impress. They often resort to duplication, kitsch, and average or below-average quality. Tourism products and experiences are often overpriced.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab dedicated its resources to exploring, mapping, and experimenting with knowledge and solutions that could improve tourism in Madaba while creating income for the local community. Our added value is in the conventional and unconventional methods we use to produce learning. We can absorb the learning on these themes without disrupting the daily work of the other pillars or partners. We were also cost-efficient as we used a modest budget to run several activities to ensure diversity of knowledge.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Madaba, serene with spiritual views, rich in cultural heritage, and embellished with mosaic, called out for a return of heartbeats and feet. The Jordan Accelerator Lab took the call and set on to explore creating work and self-reliance opportunities through tourism in Madaba.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Core question: How can tourism be a catalyst for livelihood opportunities in the Madaba governorate for women, youth, and people with disabilities? Subquestions: Who is already working on tourism in the Madaba governorate? What are they doing at both grassroots and institutional efforts? What interventions do stakeholders in the Madaba governorate suggest to improve tourism in Madaba? How can the Accelerator Lab connect proposed interventions with funding and implementation opportunities? What tools can we use to understand better the challenges related to livelihoods and tourism? How can we scale the learning products from this work?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Since June 2022, the Accelerator Lab has collected knowledge about tourism in Madaba through various activities. We are collecting the findings in a user-friendly product to share with the government, donor agencies, and the private sector. These activities include: Building a natural language processing machine (sentiment analysis) which analysed over 70K comments about tourism in Jordan on TripAdvisor, which helped identify the trends of the most frequently asked questions and concerns of international tourists. Running radio mining informed us about the local tourists' concerns and opportunities. Developing traveller's personas based on quantitative and qualitative research with the top eight nationalities visiting Jordan.  Co-ideating the indicators and targets to improve tourism in Madaba and brainstorming interventions to achieve some of these targets. Experimenting with how an open-air exhibition can improve the tourist experience in Madaba and create a revenue stream for a youth-led local non-profit organisation. Mapping 27 solutions related to tourism and livelihoods in Madaba and Jordan, including Shabubna Ezwieh, with whom we are now testing the open air exhibition.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Radio mining and sentiment analysis captured the attention of Governance and Peace pillar and their application to explore hate speech on radio and online. For example, from radio mining, we learned how much people related the impact of education on appreciating local tourism. We also learned that local tourism is more expensive than outbound.  During the focus groups with youth, women, and people with disability, we understood the limitations of the capacity-building programmes offered by NGOs and how they do not respond to these populations' needs. While the country office is familiar with many of the tools mentioned, putting them to use is less common. Running small-sized experiments captured the interest of the Resident Representative, Deputy Resident Representative, and a couple of government officials. The open-air exhibition attracted the interest of several government bodies and officials, and they liked that it was an experiment with the potential to improve on the experience afterwards. This open air exhibition, which is being implemented by  the local youth NGO Shabubna Ezwieh, demonstrates the value of solutions mapping to find new creative ideas to test that are designed by the local community. Although working with youth or NGOs is not new to UNDP, the collaboration is usually shaped around the NGO implementing a program that UNDP developed and viewing youth and local communities as beneficiaries. In the collaboration with the Accelerator Lab, we found  Shabubna Ezwieh through a mapping that valued the innovation of local communities, viewed them as "solution holders", and are supporting them to test an idea that they developed. In the experiment with the Arab tourists (colleagues from RBAS labs), they stressed the importance of storytelling of historical and modern narratives.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

There are two pathways to grow the work in Madaba; the first is to take the knowledge product mentioned above to the government, donor agencies, and the private sector to see what and how they can use these learnings.  The second pathway is to replicate this pilot in other governorates in Jordan. UNDP Jordan colleagues have had conversations with municipalities in other parts of Jordan eager to improve tourism and for UNDP to help.
