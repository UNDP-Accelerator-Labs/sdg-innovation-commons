Raed Khader, architect from the city of Madaba, has an idea for a mobile handicraft training center ( a van) that teaches handicrafts around Jordan. This is in prototype phase. He also has a workplan and presented an analysis to justify his idea.  His brief description about the idea: In addition to being one of the most beautiful manifestations of heritage, as well as being a cultural heritage, and an area for innovation, It is an activity that contributes to:  Improving income, raising the standard of living, and providing job opportunities; It is a source for developing economic resources, and one of the important factors for reviving the commercial and tourism movement. However, craftsmen in Jordan face some of the problems and challenges that have led the current generations to move away from them, which made me feel responsible for being an architect following the path of Hassan Fathi, the Egyptian architect known as the poor architect, to devote himself to studying problems and solutions and strive to solve them and revive our Jordanian heritage and culture. It is worth noting that the mosaic craft was the reason the Governorate of Madaba was added to an international network of creative cities around the world by UNESCO in 2017, and we also gained the title of the city of stone mosaics in 2016 by the International Crafts Council Problems and challenges facing the handicraft sector:  Lack of coordination in the sector Product development and development Getting to the market Production Quality control The lack of a Jordanian identity The regulatory framework Competing interest in work lack of English competency for many that work in the sector
