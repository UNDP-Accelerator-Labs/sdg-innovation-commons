> Description of the solution

Congestion pricing attempts to reduce traffic and pollution by charging prices to drive in certain parts of a city. It has been done in London, Stockholm and Singapore.

From June 2024, the New York City's plan will be the nation's first, charging most drivers a $15 toll for entering much of Manhattan below 60th Street. Trucks would pay $24 or $36, depending on their size. Taxi fares would go up by $1.25, and Uber and Lyft fares by $2.50. Officials expect the plan will reduce traffic in one of the world's busiest commercial districts by 17% - similar to other cities with congestion pricing - while also raising money for public transportation.
