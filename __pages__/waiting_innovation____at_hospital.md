Waiting Innovation(?) at Hospital

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

-This was  a couple years ago when I had eye sugary.
-It is a public hospital focusing eye health with a large number of patients

-Previously patients would wait at chair and quickly formed a line at 5am when hospital a staff member was on-stand by. It was quite a mess.
-Sometimes later when I visited the hospital again, instead of waiting at chair, patients took their shoes off at put them in-front of counter as "reservation" then they went back to the chair to sit.
