> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income for me,as well as the teachers,I wish to expand the school, in so doing the school will have more pupils, and from the we will be able to employ more teachers.
Our target market is the children within our area, (chillu, shamwana and garbon ) and possibly the surrounding area.
The challenge prize, will help our business grow, because we can build more classes and likely introduce other curriculum actives that we have not been able to achieve.
Promoting innovation allows you to achieve politically and practically, more ambitious policy goals.it allows the organization to see a way to meet the environmental more,cheaply and it creates winners.

> Technical Feasibility

Education means doing what is best for all students, teachers, lessons, and curriculum have to be flexible. we need to get our students to think and ask questions .we need to pique their curiosity and find ways to keep them interested.
We believe the thriving society of tomorrow, needs thriving young people today. children and young adults who want and can positively shape the world around them. but we have to accept that our current school model isn't working, for young people themselves or society as a whole. Because not all young people get the same chances to succeed and most are not been well prepared for a future that is not certain.
Our proposed implication plan is that our school needs to be reinvented as a key part of the learning eco-system; webs of civil society, powerful enough to enable humanity to address the problems which both threaten it and offer stipulated opportunities. we want an innovation that will help our learners not just pass tests but to thrive.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will help the lives of others,by offering free education and more jobs to unemployed teachers and mothers in the areas.
