This water well was identified near a market in Larantuka, East Nusa Tenggara. While there is open access towards the well, there are also numerous pipes stemming from the water source, which leads to individual houses in the vicinity of the site. According to locals, anyone can collect water free of charge, however, households that live nearby can opt to install dedicated private pipelines at their own cost. This initiative demonstrates the importance of strong social systems and high trust in building community resilience, particularly in an area prone to droughts and depletion of water supplies. In the nearby island of Timor, the UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab has also observed communal responses to floods and water disasters that reflected community-based resilience, which stems from a common understanding that members, old and young, must help one another.
