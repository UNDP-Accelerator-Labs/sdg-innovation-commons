> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

"The demonstration activities in Quito will focus on improving the connectivity between public transport lines and stations with various e-mobility solutions in order to contribute to the consolidation of the LEZ in the HCQ. Furthermore, the commercial and touristic character of the HCQ and the narrowness of its streets require the introduction of light electric freight vehicles (LEFV) to transport goods within the area. As such, the introduction of forty (40) e-bikes (for the bike sharing system), that will include: twelve (12) e-cargo bikes, three (3) e-buggies for passengers wanting to transfer quickly from one corridor to the other, and ten (10) e-quadricycles for last mile e-delivery services and one (1) e-delivery van will be introduced and be tested in the area with the aim of scaling it up to a larger number of vehicles. All these vehicles will be assembled by local SMEs with previous experience in the automotive sector an will count on the support and collaboration of the European industry SOL+ consortium  members and European SMEs."
