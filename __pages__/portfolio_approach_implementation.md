Portfolio approach implementation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that project-based logic behind UNDP’s programmatic response is based on linear thinking and single-point solutions, which does not contribute to system transformation.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Тhe challenges that countries are facing today are interconnected, structural and increasingly unpredictable, while governments and development partners are still applying legacy approaches in tackling them - working in silos, focusing on linear solutions and seeking predictable outcomes. Regardless of their efficacy, traditional development approaches are ill equipped to deal with the exponential changes in the environment.

An emergent practice of applying a “portfolio approach” instead is beginning to take shape in UNDP. The Accelerator Lab in Serbia has been designing a portfolio around depopulation and contributing to the design of a portfolio on SME resilience. Both of these now face the challenge of operationalization.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Accelerator Labs were created to expand the way UNDP thinks and delivers development, by applying new approaches and system thinking. The lab in Serbia has taken the lead in designing two interlinked (nested) portfolios. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We're rethinking the logic of UNDP programs to deal with complex challenges, by applying system thinking and new learning mechanisms that are more suitable for addressing constantly changing problems #PortfolioApproach

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Immediate beneficiaries include Serbia CO and colleagues working on depopulation and SME portfolios (including in UNFPA).




Other beneficiaries include corporate-wide programme colleagues interested in implementing portfolio approach in tackling complex development challenges.




Early alliances include, internally, the Strategic Innovation Unit, the RBEC regional innovation team, and individuals in BPPS and the Finance Sector Hub; externally, the approach is being discussed with the European Union Delegation to Serbia.
