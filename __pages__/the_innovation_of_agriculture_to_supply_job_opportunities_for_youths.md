New farming ideas can improve our agriculture set-up and lead us to a golden age of Agriculture and opportunity for us youths. My project focuses more on  bringing new mechanism on the agriculture sector for easy and reliable farming,and to provide an opportunity for my fellow youths who believe that change can be investable.
We've been relying much on the same olden design of farming which is busy slowing and bringing down our gross production, it's time to change and bring in new ideas to help sustain our agriculture growth. As a youth I think if we stand together with all my fellow and and with the help of the government's funds...this project can work swiftly for without even trying to be cadres to achieve something as good as this.

My innovation is designed for a sustainable green house, and use of drowns for fertilization, watering and monitoring of plants growth..since they are on the market in this error.
So I propose for this modern agriculture to be implemented within the period of the raining season.
