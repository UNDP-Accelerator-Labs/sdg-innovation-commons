> Title of the innovation

Auto(ChickenRUN)

> Brief description of the innovation

Auto(ChickenRUN) is a simple system that regulates temperature and water in a chicken run automatically without any human effect. Two vital things needed when keeping chickens are clean water and right temperature which is currently a tedious manually done job. Auto(ChickenRUN) detects the temperature of the room, if its below a certain level then the lights go on (goes off if temperature is maintained at required level) hence increasing the temperature of the room. It also regulates water by pumping clean water in the chicken drinker at intervals set by the person in charge in order to improve the health of the chickens.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Every farmer or person will want this because Auto(ChickenRUN) greatly improves chickens in both size and health, leading to more sells of chicken, in addition it will also greatly reduce the death of chickens which is a form of money loss to farmers. The prize money on the other hand will help by improving the system in the sense that it will use also use solar energy. Auto(ChickenRUN) will contribute in the growing of health and big chickens in addition to this if needed, it will be run on free energy which is not a threat to the envinronment.

> Technical Feasibility

The system is designed with the help of a microcontroller which is the brain of the operation, a temperature sensor which detects the temperature of the room and a pump which pumps clean water in the chicken drinker at a certain interval set by the person in charge.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Auto(ChickenRUN) runs automatically hence it reduces human effort by a very big margin, it also improves the health of chickens causing no bad effect on people who eat them. Greatly reduces the death of chickens which is a form of money loss to farmers. With an increase in demand in both agricultural and poultry farming, Auto(ChickenRUN) is a system that every farmer or person needs right now.
