> Brief description about the identified local solution:

One of the challenges that face the Iraqi students specially the engineering students who have graduation projects is the lack of electronics material. These materials are not available in the university nor in the local market. This startup provides a variety of needed materials to complete the practical graduation projects in Iraq. This startup is based on Human Centered Approach which mean the owners know exactly what the students want and bring the required material to them with the required consultancy. Encouraging the students to work on practical graduation projects will increase the employability opportunities for these students since they will gain experience during such journey. Also you can go to their center and to enjoy building funny and useful projects.
