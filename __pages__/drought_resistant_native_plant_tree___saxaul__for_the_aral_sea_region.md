The Aral Sea has lost 60,000 km2, or 90% of its size, over half a century.(Fortunately for us) Saxaul is a plant species native to western Uzbekistan, able to grow in harsh, saline conditions with little water, and providing a niche for varied fauna. Saxaul is a local solution for the lost biodiversity of the region. It has been acknowledged that planting Saxaul on the dried seabed is an effective way of stopping the spread of toxic salts and the desertification process.
