## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This experiment intends to support the government in the development of NDC 3.0 by encouraging meaningful and active participation of relevant stakeholders in this process to ensure that NDC 3.0 appropriately considers the real short, medium and long-term mitigation, adaptation and enabler actions on climate change that address the interest of various stakeholders. The underlying purpose of this experiment plan is not just to engage stakeholders in the process but to test whether their insights or visions effectively influence the NDC development through using a participatory approach. The experiment also aims to test a hypothesis and the proposed solutions.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If various stakeholders are well informed of the NDC 3.0 development process and given space or platform, they will meaningfully participate and contribute insights into the development process of NDC 3.0, which aims to reduce carbon emissions and build a resilient society.  

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

The experiment employed several methodologies to engage various stakeholders to participate in the development of Cambodia NDC 3.0. Those methods include (1) Stakeholder mapping, (2) Strategic Foresight methods, including Road-mapping and Three Horizons Framework, (3) an Online Campaign, (4) Innovative Challenges, and (5) a Crowdsourcing platform.  These activities will be used to collect insight and input from different groups to inform different stages of the NDC 3.0 development.
