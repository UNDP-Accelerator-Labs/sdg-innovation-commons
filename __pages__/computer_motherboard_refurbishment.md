> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Cannibalizing of computer parts, especially motherboard, and creation of new motherboards from the cannibalized parts.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

The need to have affordable computer parts to repair laptops and computers.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

Customers who needs refurbished motherboards to fix their laptops or computers.

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

Computer parts and computers, in general, are still very expensive and inaccessible to ordinary Filipinos. The Philippines is also a dumping ground of electronics waste from more developed countries. And, these innovators / hackers have found a way to utilize and monetize these waste into something useful.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

These informal computer parts refurbishers are basically waste workers who found value in the electronic waste of developing countries. There is an opportunity to teach the waste pickers proper ways to ensure safety from exposure to toxic elements from the computer parts. Their knowledge and skills can also be tapped to develop new inventions from the many parts available to them.
