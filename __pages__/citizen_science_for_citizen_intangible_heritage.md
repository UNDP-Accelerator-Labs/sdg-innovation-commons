## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

-There are many citizen social media platforms that are dedicated to safeguarding and riving Syrian Intangible heritage -Preserving heritage is not getting enough attention from national and international organizations and is considered to be a secondary matter  - Around 60% of the platforms were founded by youth who were displaced from their hometowns due to the conflict  -Number of Holder of intangible heritage practices is declining due to conflict and forced displacement. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

I could not reach the experimentation phase: - Intangible heritage is a sensitive topic in Syria; we could not get the approval to start a citizen science project.  -HoExmnt left the team

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Help us reach intangible heritage holders who are hard to reach (most of them are displaced). 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

I was skeptical in pursuing such a topic, as it is considered by many to be a secondary matter during a crises. Solutions mapping helped me understand local solutions that reflected how important intangible heritage is to the wellbeing and early recovery of communities. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

non

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

non
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

solutions mapping and citizen science helped me see intangible heritage from owners and communities perspective. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
