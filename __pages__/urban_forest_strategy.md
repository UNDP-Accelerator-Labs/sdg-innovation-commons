> Description of the solution

The Urban Forest Strategy aims to expand Melbourne's tree canopy from 22% to 40% by 2040, enhance biodiversity, and ensure species diversity by limiting the proportion of any single tree species, genus, and family. It focuses on improving vegetation health, soil moisture, and biodiversity. Community engagement and consultation are key components of the strategy, ensuring the city's green efforts are inclusive and informed by residents' input.
