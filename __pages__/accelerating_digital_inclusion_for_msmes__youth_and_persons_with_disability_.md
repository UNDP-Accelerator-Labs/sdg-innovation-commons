## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Accelerating Digital Inclusion for MSMEs, Youth and Persons with Disability.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

  Our frontier challenge is addressing youth unemployment in Kenya. Our big bet is that increased access to digital technology, information and opportunities will accelerate job and business creation for young people in Kenya. Digital exclusion prevents certain populations among the youth from accessing critical livelihood generating information and opportunities. This is particularly the case for young people living with disability, working in the informal sector and/ or living in informal settlements. The Kenya UNDP Accelerator Lab is therefore seeking to accelerate digital inclusion for youth, informal sector MSMEs and persons with disability.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Digital Economy is poised to accelerate economic growth for the country. The country’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector has been growing at an average of 10.8% annually since 2016, becoming a significant source of economic development and job creation with spillover effects in every sector of the economy. However, according to the World Bank, Kenya faces a significant digital divide, with 44% of the urban population having access to the internet compared to 17% in rural areas. In addition, widespread gaps in basic digital skills still limit wider usage and application of digital tools, and services and gaps in advanced digital skills limit business development. While 93.4% public primary schools are now covered by the Digital Learning Program, secondary schools still lag in access to connectivity and the curriculum currently fails to offer digital skills as a stand-alone compulsory course. Additionally, the digital divide becomes more pronounced amongst lower earning populations such as the informal sector which is the biggest employer of Kenya’s youth and among persons with disability. According to a report by Financial Sector Deepening Kenya, income vulnerabilities could lead to “heightened social and economic insecurity for the poorest and most vulnerable populations.” And many of the low-income earners may end up in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector. It is therefore necessary to equip these populations with the necessary skills and opportunities that will support their resilience and engagement in the present and emerging economy that is digitally focused.  According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) census report, only one in five Kenyans has access to the internet and only 3.7 per cent of the country’s population engages in e-commerce. Barriers such as fluctuating electricity and limited access of the same in many areas of the country are key drivers of digital exclusion, as are accessibility of digital devices and digital education to different populations of people including, people living with disability, people with limited access to education facilities, people in informal settlements or informal markets. Financial costs of embracing digital technology in businesses are also great barriers to businesses wanting to adopt digital technology. This is further compounded by limited access to financial instruments such as loans and equity for low earning populations.  Digital education and access to technology provides young people with options and opportunities that would improve their livelihoods. For business owners, digital education and technology can and would improve their operational efficiency and increase their access to markets.  For job seekers, digital education and literacy exposes them to an array of opportunities both nationally and internationally.

In September 2020, The Accelerator Lab conducted a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs with a special focus on the resilience and adaptability of MSMEs during and beyond the pandemic.   From this study, we saw that digital technology was a key factor in the resilience of MSMEs towards economic shocks. The study found that most enterprises 431 (74.3 percent) were at the NASCENT stage of digital maturity.  Enterprises with higher digital maturity experienced lower levels of negative impacts on operations because of COVID-19. About 417 (71.9%) NASCENT level enterprises reported negative impact on operations, 78 (13.4%) of the EXPERIMENTING, 34 (5.8%) digitally EMERGING and 30 (5.2%) of the digitally ENABLED MSMEs.     52.7% of enterprises queried highlighted the adoption and transition to online and digital platforms for market access and business operations primarily through social media. However, many of the MSMEs reported a need for skills development to facilitate their adoption of digital technology thus highlighting the need to address the issue of access of digital education and information.   Additional data source is  https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kenya/publication/kenya-economic-update-accelerating-kenyas-digital-economy

Kenya is a hot bed of creativity and innovation. However, one challenge that innovators face is barriers in accessing markets for their products. A young man's innovative product went viral on social media leading to a influx of orders for his product. Without this facilitation, the young man would not have been able to tap into the national market and perhaps even regional market that social media allowed him to. For many MSMEs and young entrepreneurs, digital access allows for this exposure. Further, it enables them acquire skills that are useful for their livelihood creation. The business market is expanding easily facilitated by ease of doing business across and within countries. There is a need to accommodate and support local businesses and MSMEs to be relevant and responsive to emerging needs and demands

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator brings in a unique perspective to the issue and that is a commitment to user-centered design. The reality is that digital inclusion is a broad issue with many drivers and stakeholders.  There are already many possible approaches to addressing the issue. However, there is a gap in supplying contextual and user-relevant solutions. There is a need to look at the existing environment and facilitate solution mapping and solution generation that is suitable and applicable within the environment. The only way to do this is to bring the diverse users onto the creative table. What does digital inclusion mean or look like for the informal trader trying to market an innovative garden bench? What skills and opportunities does he require to take advantage of the online market?  How can he compete against new regional and global players into the market? We want to bring in unique data, insights and solutions that will drive economic growth and employment for the most vulnerable populations in the country by promoting digital inclusion. Our approach is bottom up and is grounded on the lived realities of the demographic we seek to engage.
