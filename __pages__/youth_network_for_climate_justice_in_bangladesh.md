The southern region of Bangladesh such as Barisal division is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geographic location. Livelihoods of this coastal region are immensely affected by the increase of saline water. It is estimated that one-meter sea level rise can devastate the coastal region of Bangladesh. It will not only damage the agriculture and livelihood but also create massive migration due to lack of food security and employment.


Youth Net for Climate Justice, formed in 2016 is a Barisal based organization working to ensure a better environment for Bangladesh by combating the impacts of climate change. It is a youth network which is trying to bring positive environmental changes in the society with a slogan- ‘Indomitable youth ensure a safe and green world’. The organization is motivating enthusiastic youth groups of local communities to come up with better solutions to mitigate the climate change impact.


Since 2016, YouthNet for Climate Justice has been implementing various campaigns to establish the  rights of people affected by climate change in the southern regions of Bangladesh. So far, they have mobilised two thousand volunteers and served 50 thousand members of marginalised communities across 40 districts. YouthNet for Climate Justice has also created a Coastal Youth Action Hub that promotes innovative solutions to adapt to climate change issues. In 2018, they received the Joy Bangla Youth Award for their efforts.
