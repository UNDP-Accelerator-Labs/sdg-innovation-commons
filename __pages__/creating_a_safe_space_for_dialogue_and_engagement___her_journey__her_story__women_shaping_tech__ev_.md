## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This experiment was designed to evaluate how creating an invite-only, safe event environment could foster open dialogue and meaningful engagement among participants and stakeholders. The event intentionally provided a secure, intimate setting that encouraged attendees to share their personal stories and experiences in STEM while also giving partners direct access to these insights to better understand systemic challenges.

Key elements of the design included:

Invite-only format: Carefully curated participant list to ensure a safe and supportive environment, including women professionals, students, and academics in STEM.

Safe space for dialogue: Designed as a judgment-free setting to allow for honest conversations about challenges, opportunities, and successes in STEM.

Networking opportunities: Facilitated interaction among attendees to encourage community building and peer support.

Partner engagement: Stakeholders were invited to listen to firsthand accounts from participants, helping them develop more informed strategies to address barriers for women in tech.

Learning Intent:

To determine whether an exclusive, supportive event format can effectively amplify the voices of women in STEM, foster meaningful connections, and provide partners with actionable insights from direct participant engagement.

Importance:

Addressing gender imbalances in STEM requires deep understanding of the lived experiences of girls and women in the field. Traditional event formats often fail to create the safe spaces needed for honest dialogue. This experiment tested whether an invite-only format could overcome these challenges and lead to more impactful outcomes.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

An invite-only event that prioritizes safety and inclusivity will encourage greater participant engagement, foster networking, and provide stakeholders with valuable insights to inform gender-responsive strategies in STEM.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Participants included 55 individuals, primarily women in STEM, ranging from students to professionals and academics. This group was selected to ensure diverse perspectives while maintaining a safe and supportive space for dialogue. Additionally, development partners and national partners attended the event, providing them with a unique opportunity to hear firsthand accounts from participants. Their presence was essential for gaining deeper insights into systemic challenges and for informing gender-responsive policies and initiatives in STEM.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Participant Hesitation: Some attendees were initially reluctant to share personal stories, requiring additional encouragement from moderators.

Time Constraints: The depth of discussions meant some planned topics could not be covered in full.

Balancing Inclusivity and Exclusivity: Ensuring a curated yet diverse participant list required careful planning and outreach.

What advice would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Prioritize Inclusivity in Invitations: Carefully curate the guest list to ensure a safe and diverse space for dialogue.

Facilitate Comfort: Use moderators to create a welcoming environment and encourage open sharing.

Allocate Ample Time: Plan for longer discussions to allow participants to fully express their thoughts.

Engage Stakeholders Actively: Ensure partners are present to listen and engage directly with participant feedback.

Follow Up with Actions: Use insights gained from the event to shape concrete recommendations and initiatives.
