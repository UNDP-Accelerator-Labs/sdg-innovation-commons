Description: The system uses electric nebulizers (fog machines) that pump and vibrate under pressure to transform the mixture of nutrients and water into moisture, such as the humid atmosphere of a tropical or cloud area. This creates a constant moist, nutrient-rich fog for plant roots. 

Interesting feature: The water is used very well, since small amounts are needed to create the mist that nourishes the plants.
