SPONSORSHIP FOR ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN`S ORPHANAGE

> Brief description of the innovation

It is in the heart of GOD to raise orphans and vulnerable children .we at grannally orphanage are privileged to be involved in this humble task. Grannally is a non-governmental, independent, charity, Christian organization yet to be registered this year. The organization is non-denominational and has no formal relationship with any church but seeks to interact with all churches as well as bodies and individuals who share the same vision. Formation of the orphanage is to help children regardless of race, religion or sex especially in the areas of providing education, medical care and subsistence to the needy children.
The plight of our children, particularly the orphans, abandoned and neglected, if left unattended will create greater resource problems, an adverse effect on our economic growth and development of the future. In this light, religious institution, related organizations and individuals are trying to address the problems by establishing programmes that would bring smiles to the vulnerable children

The project objectives are majorly but not limited to;
	The establishment of a home for the homeless, distressed and Hiv/aids orphans
	Providing immediate needs and other timely needs of orphans like food, clothing, shelter and elementary education for the orphans, training them in the self-reliance skills that will be available at the center.
	Nurture sick and malnourished orphan children for better health and keep them well and strong through child survival programmes
	Sponsorship for school fees and other educational requirements
	By establishing projects and activities that generate income for the benefits from the sponsorship for the child
	To provide an atmosphere where children feel and know that they can be cared for and loved by others in the absence of their natural parents
	To provide the necessary frame opportunity for children in our care to build their capacities for future responsibility and good leadership.

> Technical Feasibility

In order to effectively implement the programme in line with its goals and objectives, the committee shall employ the following strategies:
	Formulate and enforce guidelines governing the operation of the home.
	Network with local and international agencies, related Ngos and the ministry for the dissemination of information, accreditation and material and logistics support.
	Conduct inspection exercise and make sure periodic visitations in order to ensure that policy guidelines are adhered to, beneficiaries are adequately cared for ,materials and supplies are properly managed and used and the programme as a whole is implemented in consonance with the ministry `s standing policies regarding orphanages.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Special consideration shall be given to orphans (both vulnerable and those living with Hiv/Aids especially girls. During the expansion phase, which shall entail construction work of school premises and furnishing, skilled laborers will be selected first from the community where the project will be elected from.
The committee shall plan and undertake meaningful fundraising programs to supplement food and tuition costs like poultry, piggery and goat keeping. This will enable us to sustain the orphanage in an absence of funds from the donor community. After constructing our school as a means of increasing revenue, we shall also allow non-orphans to benefit from our education service but at a fee.
