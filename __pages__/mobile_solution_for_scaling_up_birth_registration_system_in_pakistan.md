How a woman and a phone change the world - Telenor Group

A paper based birth registration process is cumbersome and requires considerable amounts of time to complete, resulting in a situation where parents usually opted to avoid the process altogether and their children remained unregistered. Another reason for low registration rates stemmed from a lack of awareness about the benefits of birth registration.  The use of mobile phones for scaling-up birth registration in Pakistan is an innovative and efficient supplement to the paper-based manual birth registration system.
