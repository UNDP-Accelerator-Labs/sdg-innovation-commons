The plastic bags converted into  useful paving bricks. First the waste plastic bag is collected and melted. The melted plastic bag is mixed with sand, poured the mixture in to mold  sheet and then dried up to complete the process

The recycling is useful to reduce water and soil pollution that will be occurred due to uncollected plastic bag waste. Moreover, it’s benefit is extended to reduce infrastructure damage as far as the plastic waste is collected from ditches and roadsides and converted to paving bricks.
