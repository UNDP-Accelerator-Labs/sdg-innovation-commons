## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Supporting the winners of the COVID-19 Innovation Challenge Ghana and building an innovation learning cycle
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to support the winners of the Ghana COVID-19 Innovation Challenge and to build a learning and iteration cycle with them. We are accompanying the innovators on a journey of self discovery, helping them to develop and implement their innovations on the ground. Using a systems approach we intend to document their lived experiences as innovators. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The COVID-19 Innovation Challenge was held last year by AccLab Ghana to identify and support local solutions designed to help society adjust and recover in this period of the pandemic. The winners of the Challenge were announced in December 2020, and they have received grants early this year from UNDP to support their work. Our aim is to support them and build a learning and iteration cycle with them. This will be challenging in the sense that many of the winners are not typical innovators and their innovations embrace tricky issues such as the informal economy, vulnerable groups including the disabled, and those focused on issues relating to rural and hard-to-reach groups in the areas of health and agriculture. Quite a few of these innovations target women. We are aiming to go on a journey with these innovators, understanding how their proposed innovations are developed and implemented on the ground, but also to be part of their lived experience to understand the systems of issues which affect them. Most especially, we need to understand how these systems of issues interact to create different outcomes. In learning how innovations are actually being implemented on the ground, we aspire to apply different approaches to test new prototypes and carry out experiments to solve problems.  We also aim to develop our learning into a living electronic manual which supports work with innovators across UNDP and the UN system - a manual which provides a unique and different perspective on how we can support innovators to thrive, particularly in an African context. We see synergies with wider work across UNDP on Social Protection in the Informal Economy and perspectives from the African Borderlands.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The UNDP AccLab Ghana Innovation Challenge was a very successful initiative, attracting almost 200 high quality applications, from almost every region of Ghana, and in the middle of a pandemic. The Challenge was one of the very few to go beyond tech solutions to consider solutions focusing on social and environmental issues, including matters affecting the disabled and supporting rural communities. The Lab has developed significant expertise in supporting and learning from grassroots innovators in Ghana and we believe it is absolutely critical that the post-Challenge phase is supported and documented. This should not be in a static way, but in a dynamic way which invites UNDP and Innovators to learn together. We intend to apply what we are learning from the Theory U workshops to this project.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The main stakeholders we are currently engaging with are the winners of the COVID-19 Innovation Challenge - including a wide range of innovators (including grassroots innovators) and organisations. Some of the organisations are private companies while others are community based non-governmental organisations. At this stage, we are gathering the information on the innovations such as types, current stage, further support required, etc. to better assist them to develop their innovations.
