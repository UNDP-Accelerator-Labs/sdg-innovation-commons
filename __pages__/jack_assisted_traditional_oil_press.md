Traditional oil-press is altered using a jack to assist in oil pressing, reducing workload and time. Sekiu oil is traditionally used to flavour food. It is extracted from the seeds of Sekiu tree (Madhuca motleyana), which fruits only once every few years. To make sekiu oil, the traditional method would be to place the materials in between two logs, and clamp the logs together to press out the oil. This traditional oil-press is called 'kepisen', or 'ales', and is operated manually by hammering the logs together. As the gap between the logs closes, the sekiu, placed in the bag, is pressed and oil is extracted as a result. Alteration has been made to the oil-press with a hydraulic jack with manual winch that replaces the need for hammering. The force from the jack substitutes manual hammering, reducing workload and manpower, as well as time in operating the 'kepisen'.
