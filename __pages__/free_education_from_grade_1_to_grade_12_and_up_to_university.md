Free education

A lot of people will be educated and we are going more skilled people in our country

> Technical Feasibility

When it comes with giving bursaries(student loans) or scholarships from the Higher Education loans and scholarships board. They don't give bursaries fairly, or in short they give bursaries to applicants whom they know or to whom they are related. My concern over this is that the ministry of higher education loans and scholarships board should be fair when giving out bursaries especially to the vulnerable applicants, so that everyone can benefit and it can really help us in developing our country socially and economically

> Anticipated Social Impact

To make bursaries available, regardless of status, race, colour, gender and so on. So that everyone can be educated

Samson Mulenga
