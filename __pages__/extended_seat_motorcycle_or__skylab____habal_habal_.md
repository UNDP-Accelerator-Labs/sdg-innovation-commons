> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Habal-habal is a highly improvised two-wheeled single motorcycle usually ridden beyond its passenger capacity. It is used as public transportation especially in areas with narrow roads, and steeper, rougher terrain where it could possibly carry up to 6 passengers, at the least. Habal-habal could accommodate more than 10 persons, with baggages ranging from vegetables and groceries to livestock like chicken yet to be included.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

Public transportation especially in areas with narrow roads, and steeper, rougher terrain.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

Locals usually living in mountainous areas wherein roads are mostly not accessible by 4 wheel vehicles

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

In urban areas, it is an everyday picture that you see 1 to 2 persons riding on a motorcycle. However, it is not the case when it comes to the streets of mountainous areas in Mindanao and some parts of Visayas. Habal-habal big help to locals usually living in mountainous areas wherein roads are mostly not accessible by 4 wheel vehicles. Interesting about this mode of transportation is that the ability/skill of the driver to balance considering the weight of the passengers from side to side, front, plus another 3 to 4 persons at his back.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

It is used especially in remote villages with rough and narrow roads. Farmers also need the Habal-Habal to transport their goods to the market.
