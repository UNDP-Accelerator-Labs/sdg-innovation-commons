It help me generate  money because I'll be selling the best products that can be exported,and this itself can boost economic generation thereby reducing the unemployed in the community and at the national level too. It will also add more competitive to the already existing innovations

> Technical Feasibility

It is made of steel which is welded, the most needed thing materials only. I  wish make more of these products in so that the supply can be high. Duration of the implementation depends with the availability of funds

> Anticipated Social Impact

It help more people find jobs because this field of work needs human resources to have the best outcomes that will hugely contribute to the growth of market because of exporting.It will also add more competitive to the already existing ideas in the markets
