When we were tasked by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine to find incentives and shortcuts for senior citizens to acquire digital skills, we have come the conclusion that most of the people rely on their grandchildren to show them how to buy medicine online, how to submit a complaint, register for an event or do any other online task.
