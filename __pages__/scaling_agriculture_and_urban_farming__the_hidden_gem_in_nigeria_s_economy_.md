## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Scaling agriculture and urban farming: The hidden gem in Nigeria's economy.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

​Our challenge :  Poor livelihoods, inefficient supply chains and inadequate production systems  within the agriculture value chain. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The weak links within the value chain between subsistence farmers in rural areas and logistic and supply chain managers (hauling, storage, processing and retailers/market) have led to food wastage in rural areas and lack of access to fresh produce in urban areas due to inefficient transportation solutions, inadequate to nil food storage and processing  facilities in many subsistence farming communities. On a micro level, there are economic  consequences on the farmers as they are unable to make reasonable returns on the efforts put into farming. The value chain connections and the inefficiencies within the agricultural  sector also affect the economy on a macro level as agriculture plays a smaller role in the national economy than it should. ​The unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 33.3% in December 2020, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Youth  unemployment is particularly high as more than 60% of Nigeria’s working-age population is younger than 34. Migration to cities and towns has led to a high number of unemployed youths and less people to farm in the rural areas. These crowded cities and towns have also led to greater demand for food in those areas and results in higher prices. Due to high inflation, and lack of access to fresh produce in cities, there is therefore an opportunity to find ways to diversify farming geographically while improving the value chain of the current farmers. Covid restrictions have made the cost of crops to rise within the country, making it more difficult for people to feed.​Additionally, small farmers in Nigeria majorly operate in the informal sector and are not able to access the tools they need, technical support required, and come from disadvantaged communities.

There is urgency to address challenges within the agriculture sector for the following reasons: ​​RISING UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN NIGERIA.​The unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 33.3% in December 2020, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Youth  unemployment is particularly high as more than 60% of Nigeria’s working-age population is younger than 34. "Unemployment for people aged 15 to 24 stood at 53.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and at 37.2% for people aged 25 to 34. The jobless rate for women was 35.2% compared with 31.8% for men." Agriculture ties in with Nigeria’s unemployment as it employs nearly 70% of the country’s population. But despite this substantial amount, there is a decline in employment in the agriculture sector, which presents  severe challenges in the country. ​​AGRICULTURE REMAINS THE BASE OF NIGERIA'S ECONOMY.​In spite of the oil, agriculture remains the base of the Nigerian economy, providing the main source of livelihood for most Nigerians. "Even though agriculture still remains the largest sector of the Nigerian economy and employs two-thirds of the entire labour force, the production hurdles have significantly stifled the performance."​​HIGH FOOD IMPORT COST AND DEPLETION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS​Nigeria imports more agricultural products than it exports. "In four years (2016–2019), Nigeria’s cumulative agricultural imports between 2016 and 2019 stood at N3.35 trillion, four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period".  This massive importation of agricultural products co-exists with heavy wastage of locally farmed produce during each harvest season.  The depreciation of the Naira caused by significant drop in foreign exchange earnings compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, means that the country has limited foreign exchange for food importation and must optimise local production and distribution systems. The depreciation of the Naira caused by significant drop in foreign earnings also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ​​RISING INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY​Rising inflation (over 20%) has also meant that household budgets for feeding have increased significantly while real earnings have reduced. ​​http://www.fao.org/nigeria/fao-in-nigeria/nigeria-at-a-glance/en/​https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/afcfta-agribusiness-current-state-nigeria-agriculture-sector.pdf​https://businessday.ng/agriculture/article/nigerias-post-harvest-losses-surge-amid-covid-19-pandemic/​https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/nigeria-unemployment-rate-rises-to-second-highest-on-global-list​

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There has been a lot of innovation in the agriculture sector with many startups emerging to address the inefficiencies within the agricultural sector in the country.  The Accelerator Lab is better placed to trial and execute quick solutions in this context. The rapid and high rate of inflation for food (over 20%), decreased foreign exchange earnings https://www.cbn.gov.ng/rates/inflrates.asp and increased unemployment rates (over 30%) require urgent attention. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1119227/forecasted-unemployment-rate-in-nigeria/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20unemployment%20rate,estimated%20to%20reach%2032.5%20percent.
