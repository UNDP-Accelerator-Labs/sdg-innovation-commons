## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Negative perception of products from Chernobyl-affected districts on internal and external markets hinders entrepreneurship development and economic growth;

Development of entrepreneurship that builds on local customs and traditions and makes use of territories' unique features is crucial for improving territorial brand for Chernobyl-affected districts;

Expanding digital presence of entrepreneurs from Chernobyl-affected districts through social networks and marketplaces  is key to effective outreach of a new narrative for these territories; 

Networking, participation in local fairs and community-based events helps to increase local entrepreneurs' sense of belonging and confidence, encourage cluster initiatives and, ultimately, joint positioning of businesses from Chernobyl-affected districts. Such instruments as mentoring can further strengthen capacities and peer-to-peer learning among local entrepreneurs. 

Social impact of a business can be an additional value proposition of local products. Where applicable, entrepreneurs should position social impact of their business such as employment of people with disabilities, creation of jobs for local populations in Chernobyl-affected districts, and other.
