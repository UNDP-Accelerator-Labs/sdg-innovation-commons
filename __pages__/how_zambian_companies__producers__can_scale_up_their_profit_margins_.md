HOW ZAMBIAN COMPANIES (PRODUCERS) CAN SCALE UP THEIR PROFIT MARGINS.

> Brief description of the innovation

TITLE : HOW ZAMBIAN COMPANIES (PRODUCERS) CAN SCALE UP THEIR PROFIT MARGINS.

 Profit making is one the greatest reasons why producers exist. producers range from small market enterprises to large enterprises. The existence of companies/ producers largely depends on the environmental conditions that surround it. Most of these conditions call for the need to consistently apply technology in order to increase the market share, revenue generation and profit.

My innovation involves applying a special type of technology that will ensure continuous increase in profit going forward. This innovation was inspired by the economic conditions we faced as Zambians after the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

I believe the Covid-19 pandemic is a wake up call that the world is going "ONLINE" and that producers need to improve service delivery in those lines. I believe that through strong intersectoral linkages and Communication that permits easy access to goods and services, Zambian companies can scale up their profit margins.

THE IDEA

I will give practical examples based on research and experience. Shoprite, Game, Pick n Pay, Trade kings, Toyota Zambia etc may work hand in hand with Banks and mobile money service providers such as Airtel, MTN or Zamtel in order to create what I call "Effective online stores." this is based on the fact that the average Zambian either owns a bank account or mobile money account used for daily transactions. 
Consumers naturally like easy and quick access to goods and services. Note that some of the Zambian companies have online stores, what distinguishes this from my innovation is that it is "effective , efficient and assumes a Covid-19 pandemic era. 

I will narrow down my explanation to how pick n pay and Airtel  can work together to scale up their profit margins. Pick n Pay can create an Online store where all its goods and services inclusive of the prices, may be accessed by consumers. Airtel may then link the persons Airtel mobile money account to the Pick n Pay online store. in the comfort of their homes, consumers may shop online and receive an Airtel money voucher showing a list of goods and services purchased inclusive of the prices allowing the consumer to shop at any pick n pay store around the country. Airtel can also allow consumers to "by for other consumers online" just like bundles or Airtime. Imagine receiving a text saying " You have received a voucher to shop 2kg sugar," visit any pick n pay store near you now!" This initiative may also help vigilant parents to send goods and services to their children back home without having to worry about whether they may use the money sent to them for other agendas. The " worry" aspect would make producers lose potential transactions from consumers. How can this benefit pick n pay and Airtel? they can both get commission for every transaction made by a consumer.

We see that having such effective online stores can increase daily transactions and hence extensively scale up the profit margins for both Airtel and Pick n pay due to the fact that the number of daily transactions made would increase (the revenue generated would increase). Transactions per day would increase also due to the fact that the cost of purchasing goods on the consumer's part will be reduced (transport costs). The rate at which consumers purchase bundles would also increase because of the extra online activities which will then increase the profit margins for network service providers. The same applies to many different companies in Zambia.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

HOW ZAMBIAN COMPANIES CAN SCALE UP THEIR PROFIT MARGINS AMIDST THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

This innovation will create strong intersectoral linkages, a necessary ingredient for economic development. This is so because companies will work together to achieve their most desired interests, which is profit generation. An increase in profit generation will translate into an increase in both employment and output in Zambia.

The increase in profit margins will increase the levels of investment and expansion which will then create employment for many Zambian citizens.  increases in Profit Margins of companies will also signal the increase in the average income of workers which then lead to improved living standards. The high income elasticity among citizens will then attract foreign investors (foreign direct investment) in the country.

The challenge price will help me come up with ways of working with different skilled and competent people in order to see this innovation come alive and influence various sectors to take up this challenge in order to create sustainable development for Zambia and Africa at large.

> Technical Feasibility

DESIGN OF THE INNOVATION
The operations of this innovation will be based on strong intersectoral linkages between financial markets and other markets. The innovation is designed not only to raise profit margins for one sector but various sectors in Zambia. The increase in profit margins will then trickle down to increased living standards that are necessary for poverty alleviation.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
We plan on engaging various stakeholders who have interest in the innovation in order to see the innovation come alive.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will help alleviate poverty in Zambia through the creation of employment for many Zambian youths. It will further create infrastructure development and more foreign investment in Zambia.

This innovation is relevant to the market in the sense that it will help increase the number of daily transactions made by consumers due to the maximum utility they receive, it will also help increase the levels of investment and production. It will also bring about an increase in savings. How? if producers make more profits than before, the average incomes of workers will increase giving them enough money to save or consume.
