Agriculture drones can usually carry up to 10kg of pesticide and cover a hectare of a rice paddy field in half an hour. A manual labourer would take five hours to do the same task. Besides that, farmers prefer spraying using drones because the pesticide spreads out more evenly, which increases their yields compared to the normal practice of using pumps. Farmers can now spray up to 10 hectares of paddy fields a day, while charging between RM12 to RM20 for every 0.29 hectare of paddy field.

The youth said he has made up to RM5,000 a month and has been receiving more requests from Yan and Alor Star, which are more than 30 minutes away from his village.
