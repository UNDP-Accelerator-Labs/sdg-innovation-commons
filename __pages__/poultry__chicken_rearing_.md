> Brief description of the innovation

I do poultry farming/ keep chickens to sustain my lively hood, and of those women who are willing to learn from this initiative.
I also use manure/ the chickens waste products as an organic fertilizer.
This fertilizer is used for the crops that  I plant such as; 
Maize and vegetables that I sale too.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I want my business to go on a broader market, were I can also supply my products in supermarkets.
That will help me to generate more income for myself and other women too.
The challenge prize will help grow the business and enable me to teach more women to be financially independent.
The value of this project to environment is that, it doesn't destroy  the soil but rather improves it without any chemicals.

> Technical Feasibility

It is designed to empower women and those who want to gain the skill in poultry farming and how it's wastes can be used.
I plan to use this implementation to help other women, giving them the skill and empowering them.
I also want to teach others in growing crops using chicken manure/ organic fertilizer, which can help people to spend less on other chemical fertilizer.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It can improve others lives by gaining skill and empowerment, because I know if I am blessed, am blessed to bless others.
