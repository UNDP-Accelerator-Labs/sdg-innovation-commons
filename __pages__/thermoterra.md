> Description of the solution

The Thermoterra was founded by CEO Dror Zchori from Israel. It is an energy system that harvests energy from fluctuations in humididty. Water vapor in the air that is absorbed onto or into an absorptive material transfers a significant amount of energy. When water evaporates it causes a cooling effect.
