> Title of the innovation

Disability Safezone Project

> Brief description of the innovation

The rationale of this project is creation of safe spaces and worthwhile disability zones. The existence of a Disability Zone safe space has potential to elicit heated reactions from society. They have power to strengthen the voice and relevance of persons living with disabilities. Safe spaces have recorded a high number of success stories in most developed countries. The Disability Zone Project seeks to provide emotional security, an interconnectedness of similar values and nurturing/stimulating environment. The Disability Zone Project seeks to pilot a haven safe space for persons living with disabilities. This project will boost the performance of persons living with disabilities, they provide a break from judgment, unsolicited opinions, they allow people to feel supported and respected. This will involve 3-4 hour weekly group meetings with a mentor who provides training on health, leadership and life skills, as well as discusses issues that affect Young teenage girls who are disabled on issues to do with sexual reproductive health rights, child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, and how they can seek help. The safe space will  also have a simple rule that boosts its long term impact.
According to UNICEF Zambia, the Zambia National Disability Survey 2015 which was initiated by the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS), and implemented by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and UNICEF Zambia Its main objective was to estimate the national prevalence of disability among adults and children, disaggregated by sex, severity of disability, province and the rural/urban division. Prevalence of disability was estimated to be 10.9 per cent among adults (18+ years). It was higher in urban than in rural areas, and higher among females than among males. Among children (2–17 years), the prevalence was estimated to be 4.4 per cent. Prevalence varied between the provinces, with the highest estimates in Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces among both adults and children. Around 10 per cent said they had been beaten or scolded, and around 8 per cent reported experience of having been discriminated against by public services. Abuse and discrimination increased with severity of disability. About 8 per cent had experienced physical abuse as a child, while 2 per cent had suffered sexual abuse. Relatively few persons with disabilities are aware of disabled people’s organizations (DPOs) and only 5.3 percent said they belonged to one. In rural areas, the main problem is that many of the services and facilities are simply not available to persons with disabilities.
It is believed that the prevalence rate would be higher than the WHO’s projected global number of 10% for reasons relating to wide spread poverty, illiteracy, overpopulation, lack of awareness and above all lack of medical care and services. However, we conducted a study on disability in some selected areas which reveals that 5% of the population is disabled in one way or another and this result is closer to the estimate of the WHO. The vast majority of these people are not only poor but among the poorest among the poor. Poverty and disability reinforce one another contributing to vulnerability and exclusion. They do not have access to the basic human needs. They are kept away from the mainstream society. The baseline Situation Regarding Disability in Zambia is alarming.

National Disability Survey conducted an indepth study of the barriers to and facilitators of lifelong learning and skills development for persons with disabilities in Zambia. The study was carried out by the University of Zambia (UNZA), in collaboration with SINTEF Digital, Norway. People in the various communities studied had a good understanding of what it means to have disabilities and most informants suggested causes that are widely accepted. However, there was also a significant lack of knowledge which may give rise to stigma, fear and social isolation on the part of the community. Such lack of knowledge also affected people’s perspective of what persons with disabilities’ participation in society should entail. According to the study there are many laws and policies that include persons with disabilities in Zambia, but their implementation is limited. The Disability Act of 2012 ensures full and equal human rights and freedoms to persons with disabilities. However, there was the perception of a gap between this Act and its implementation at local level. There it poses as a threat to the well-being of persons living with disabilities. The overall goal of the Disability Zone project is to create an enabling safe environment for persons living with disabilities.

> Technical Feasibility

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

The implementation of the project will be managed at national level by Fountain of Peace and Support Organization and implementation of the project at field level in Lusaka the capital City and sub offices in Shibuyunji district. process of policy dialogue will determine priorities at national level and this will generate buy-in for national level action. Representative organizations of people with disabilities at each level will be involved at all stages of the project's development - at the level of the "project committee", in the development of each core product/action and the development and monitoring of the project. A strategy for how to effectively involve people with disabilities will need to be agreed at the planning stage for each action. Each level will be responsible for reporting on actions under their responsibility which will be consolidated by Donor. This project fits within the overall programme, policy and monitoring structure of Fountain of Peace and Support. In this context, the project will be subject to all of Fountain of Peace and Supports operational procedures e.g. contracting, procuring, finance control, etc. Fountain of Peace and Support has internal operational oversight and audit procedures which obviate risks such as corruption, a well rounded code of conduct  and mismanagement. Criteria for selecting pilot projects will be developed within the first six months of the project. They will need to take into consideration interest from the country, governance, available infrastructure, human resource capacity, finances available, partner capacity (Government, NGO and social organizations), and the ability for the project to leverage systemic change and increase regional capacity for action. Across the portfolio of activity, attention will be given to ensure gender equality, pro poor emphasis and cross disability involvement with a focus on underrepresented groups. Tools on how to assess the situation and the readiness of countries for policy change will be developed as part of the project. These tools will assist in providing a contextual analysis, building a baseline and identifying stakeholders, and will be employed with countries during national level policy dialogues on the Donor report.
