The Bee Modular Box for Kelulut (Stingless Bees) is an innovation by Dr Khairuddin Ramliy and his research team for modern bee farming. This innovation helps the community in Simpang Renggam, Johor, to have a decent living while ensuring the environment is protected. Based on a quadruple-helix model between UTM, the state government, corporate bodies and the local community, the innovation aims to produce high-quality products for the stingless bee honey market. The innovation is able to solve societal problems holistically.  The community benefits from selling the honey and its by-products, as well as from tourist visits. The innovation has helped the community generate a sustainable and profitable income. The university team also provides training to the community regarding entrepreneurship to equip them with knowledge on branding, marketing and business management. This would allow the community to be independent in the long run. The modular design   Dr Khairuddin and his team created a special kind of concrete to build the box without compromising the quality of the stingless bee honey. The special concrete ensures that honey can be produced in a safer and long-lasting environment for at least ten years as compared to the ones made from wood or normal concrete. The business model offered to the community also includes a contracted buy-back of the honey produced, through an external contractor.
