> Title of the innovation

Enhancing rural solar electrification

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation consist of solar panels of about 100W to 1000W. It's have an inverter which can supply the stated power, and of course batteries that can with stand the night.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Basically, my idea of the innovation can add value and sustain the rural settlers through irrigation so that people can not have challenges in terms of gardening. This will enable the to have no challenge in farming all the season regardless of the rain season.

> Technical Feasibility

Well, my innovation is designed to Carter for gardening farming and help in lighting system. Innovation prototype was done at first, now due to financial problems it couldn't be done. But the is a layout of how it can be done ( you can refer on the photos uploaded)

> Anticipated Social Impact

Through farming and clean power energy source.
