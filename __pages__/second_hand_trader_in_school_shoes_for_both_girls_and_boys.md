> Title of the innovation

Second hand trader in school shoes for both girls and boys

> Brief description of the innovation

Trading in second hand school shoes for both girls and boys. Float the advert on Facebook and deliver to potential customers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The idea is to buy them at a cheaper price and sell out with a profit margin. Target audience is parents in need of quality school shoes for school kids. Growth of the business potentially depends on the availability of the number of source.
The value addition to the environment is families are in great need of quality shoes for school kids as our local products are of low quality.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation plan can only be implemented if assisted with capital as a beginner wether the actual consignment or cash to purchase the consignment..
There is no prototype in existence but would rather trade in any quality shoes meant to last sometime.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Most families spend too much in excess purchase of our local low quality shoes, therefore given access to import quality shoes for school kids will definitely satisfy the entire community and ultimately save families from excess spending on shoes every year. The relevance to the existing market will definitely motivate and improve on the manufacturing of our local products to meet the imported standards.
