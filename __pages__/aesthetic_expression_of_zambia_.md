> Brief description of the innovation

We are a group of photographers that are dedicated to documenting Zambia in its most beautiful &amp; aesthetic nature. 

We do this not only for the love of the beauty of our country but also to showcase this beauty to the outside and foreign word.

Therefore, in a practical sense, we would like to play a major and key role with the Ministry of Tourism, as our work and innovation of aesthetic documentation of our country through photography is going to improve the outlook of our country and most importantly attract more tourists and thereafter increase revenue in the sector of tourism and our country at large. 

We hope you see our vision and share it with us. We shall be waiting for your positive response as we are a patient and highly dedicated group of photographers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As photographers, we carry a lot of commercial viability, this stems from the fact that the content that will be created from the documentation of our country will lead to more tourist engaging directly with our country and that in turn will give out a good output towards the country’s revenue earning. 

Commercially if we are supported, we will also be able signify a strong hold to attract tourists directly to our country, for example The mighty Victoria falls is under the South African tourist plan and poorly advertised and documented in its own country.

Therefore, if we a commercially implemented, we can work towards improving and boosting the tourist revenue through viable and commercial domination of our country to directly attract tourists into our beautiful country.

> Technical Feasibility

The design of Our group of photographers is based on experiencing different regions of Zambia and documenting each region, for example the images attached show monuments in Ndola that are beautiful and eye catching, so much that they leave the viewer with a curiosity about the city.

For an implementation plan, Our group of photographers will need to be given the chance and free will of movement so as they can document the aesthetic nature of our country, our photographers will also have to work hand in hand with the guidance of the Ministry of Tourism to ensure that all images documented are present in the right form and on the right plans and to the right channels.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Social Impact of our innovation will be great! Finally Zambia will be documented by creative and open minded Zambians which is the majority of our country right, aspiring and highly driven youth.

And apart from impacting the livelihood of the youth, it will also improve the minds of the youth, to see that beauty and art exist not far from them but all around them. 

Therefore, our impact will not only be through a better revenue scheme for the ministry of Tourism but also the mindsets of youth in our country and all in individuals in our country.
