## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Understand why mobile banking isn't working in Morocco and see if we can change behaviors 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If women entrepreneurs use mobile banking solutions then they will improve theirs sales & turnover

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

awareness 
incentives
measurement


> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of women downloading/using a mobile banking application
Number of transactions
Amount of transactions


> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

- From banks (using download data) - more objective data
- From women directly (through UNDP Ambassadors programme) - use self-reported data (women answer a survey and say if they've downloaded the app and used it once). This data may be more biased (self-desirability bias = women are more likely to tell you that they've done it even though they haven't to please you). 
- From both

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

14 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
