## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Kunzang Wangmo 

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

30 July 2021

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Circular Economy 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Plastic waste circularity towards the Zero Waste Bhutan. 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How to bring circularity to the plastic waste by scaling up effort through private sector partnership. 

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Fully Randomised (RCTs, etc.)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

1. The Coca Cola Foundation 

2. Waste service providers/handlers located in the community level.

3. Local governments 
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuly.**

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

Inform Royal Government of Bhutan's waste flagship program where the government is bringing in policy change by introducing 3rd stream of waste at the household level. The 3rd stream of waste is household hazardous waste and RED color bin is introduced for it. 

> What is the object being tested?

Three colored bins. Green bin for wet waste; Blue bin for dry waste; and RED bin for household hazardous waste (new stream of waste)  

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?



Eight months 

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

The 600 plus households were randomly selected from among the 7,000 plus households in Changzamtog and categorized into three groups. Group 1: Control: 200 households Group 2: Treatment 1: 200 households were provided with 3 colored bins + information Group 3: Treatment 2: 200 households were provided with 3 colored bins + information + feedback The neighborhood was identified for its good representation of households with diverse needs and socio-economic status. Random selection and allocation of the household in separate groups allowed cancellation of our biasness.

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome

> What are the resources required for this experiment?

Behavioral Insight Experts: we hired BIT Australia. They were engaged with us remotely.

## Review
**This section includes observations by peer reviewers**
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> What were the key results?



Segregation of dry waste (Blue Bin)  Our estimates of the treatment effect are between: ●Bins + Information: 6.3 and 8.4 percentage points ●Bins + Feedback: 7.2 and 10.7 percentage points No impact on wet waste (Green bin) Hazardous waste in dry and wet bins declines with introduction of red bins.   

> What were the key insights of this experiment?

“We thought it was going to be an easy task but the first day of our survey, we realized it was challenging and tedious. Food scrapes and other waste from outside the surrounding were found in dry waste bins. Segregation was not at all meticulous. We came across condoms, torn underwear, metals and broken glasses while sifting through the waste. The survey indirectly made us cultivate new lessons every collection day.”

> Any observations about the methodology?

RCT can be as expensive  Difficult to control interventions in a social setup so applying RCT for social challenge have to adjust the contaminations.  

> Time it took to implement

Eight months
