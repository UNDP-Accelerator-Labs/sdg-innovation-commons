> Brief description of the innovation

"ADAPTING TO GLOBAL JOB MARKET CHANGE"
 
It's interesting to realize that the way people live, work and spend their money has changed drastically over the past decade, especially with the advent of various innovations in Technology.This  Technological era has caused a major shift in all aspects of life, including the way we work. 

As such, online consumer-driven products and services, free communication platforms and globalized networks have created a much bigger space than ever before for outsourcing, contracting, temping and freelancing.

The impact of Covid-19, has made many organisations adopt home working and turn to virtual communication and conferencing in huge numbers. This is unlikely to be completely reversed when vaccination programmes and other mitigation measures help to conquer the pandemic.

Look out for my full outlined Article with the following *Effective Remedial Measures that Developing Countries can Employ In Addressing The Current Global Job Market Change:*

✓ Readjustment of Humanitarian Development Conceptual Framework.

✓ Implementation Of Swift Adaptation Strategies.

✓ Localization Of Global Agreements.

✓ Enhancing Improved Coordination &amp; Collaboration between/ Among Organizations.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The performance of frontline employees in any organization depends on the skill sets they have and these skill sets determine the employees’ performance quality in different business situations.However in today’s complex economy, organizations are finding it difficult to sustain the competition because of huge skills gap in the workforce. Since analysis of skill gap provide crucial information of the employees so that the managers can focus on necessary skills that are required to enhance performance and sustainable enabling environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The purpose of this innovation is to provide  organizations with a continuous attempt to optimally enhance the front line employee’s performance of such organizations using available human resource. This innovation contends that there is a skill gap between expected and the actual skills of the workforce. 
Results can therefore be inferred as technical skill has a minimal role improving the performance of the front line employees in designing industry as majority of the work is done by machines. The regression results will still provide evidence that technical skill alone may not improve performance of employees and interpersonal skill even important for performance of frontline employees, may not impact the enhanced performance. So organizations should therefore take necessary initiation to correct the skill gap factor of employees of the organization to achieve the objectives.
