What is Origins?

Origins is a personal incubation; aims to put participants on the driver’s seat on a safe, fun and well-designed learning journey. The destination of their journey is to enter the private sector as entry level employees or as interns by developing their knowledge, skills and attitudes. This program is implemented and owned by a local startup called Doinc for Business Development and Consultation.

All the cultures we know asked the same question themselves: how did the world come to be? How were people and life born? And nowadays, we as humans are asking about how these cultures were born, and by basic logic, you can figure out that we asked about things – cultures, religions, and even the universe itself self- happened many decades, centuries ago and such questions are driven by curiosity and the desire of knowing how did they establish memorable buildings, figures, and ideas that dominated the human history; as Steve Jobs once said, you can only connect dots looking to the past to reshape the future we believe that it is time to ask our self about things happens in our daily life, it is time to back to origins. Going back to our origins means looking for patterns in the experiences that formulated persons who made the harmonious work environment and experience that shaped their attitude, behavior and knowledge; looking for the same elements that those persons had during their lives to be what they had become later. This understanding is not the purpose itself; it is to pave the way for those who can join private sector after that. At Origins, we aim to create and improve the knowledge, attitude, and behavior in a way fits with the participants entry to the Iraqi local market as an employee provides practical value reinforce by theoretical and technique knowledge in their matters of interest.

The main purpose of Origins overall is to provides participants with swords and shield to enter the private sector throughout leading companies. While this version is aiming to the same purpose but through the gate of Doinc as interns.
