Serbian SMEs' and startups' resilience and growth - this experiment seeks to foster and promote entrepreneurship and innovation in Serbia, which could be seen as a response to the challenge of fostering economic development and growth in the country.


> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Serbia conducted this experiment with the primary goal to create a web portal that provides start-up companies with information that is user-friendly, straightforward, and easy to access in order to facilitate the development, expansion, and scaling of their businesses. The exercise was aimed to assist participants in answering the learning question of how to increase start-ups' access to information regarding financial assistance programs, regulatory changes, and networking and education opportunities.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

If we redesign the experience of an informed startup decision-making process through the development of a digital platform (micro-website within a larger one) that fosters the growth and development of startups in Serbia, then we can meet the unmet needs of Serbian startups.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

As the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Serbia, our objective with this activity was to facilitate the creation of a web platform tailored to the distinct needs and expectations of Serbian startups in varying stages of development. Our ultimate aim was to design an interactive prototype that would foster growth and development among Serbian startups. Leveraging user-centric tools and the Design Thinking methodology, we sought to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by startups and create a solution that could augment the resilience, sustainability, and scalability of these businesses. Our overarching goal was to contribute to the establishment of an enabling environment that would support the continued success of Serbian startups and IT businesses.


> What is the object being tested?

Serbian startups and  IT/tech businesses

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?

Q3 and Q4 of 2021 

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

The experimental activity utilized the 5-phase Design Thinking model with the goal of providing a web platform for Serbian startups to access the information they need to grow their businesses. The team members participated in four interactive workshops to prepare for the Design sprint and were guided and facilitated by the Design Thinking practitioners. The project was divided into two parts: the first phase focused on researching and understanding the problem we were tackling, while the second phase focused on creating and testing prototypes during a week-long Design sprint. The project utilized the double diamond structure (Discovery, Definition, Development and Delivery), where the first diamond deals with researching and understanding the problem, and the second diamond deals with developing and testing solutions. The project team formed around this activity identified potential users of the future startup portal and explored their needs, aspirations, motives, and expectations regarding user experience. The project utilized a combination of in-person workshops and online collaborative tools, including the MIRO board. The data collection technique utilized various methods such as interviews, quantitative research, desk research, testing, and feedback sessions. Data analysis techniques used were qualitative and quantitative analysis and iterative testing to refine the solution. 

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the resources required for this experiment?

In order to ensure that this experiment was successfully carried out, a wide variety of stakeholders were involved in the process. The most important asset that was required for this experiment was time, which had to be devoted to and used for the purpose of preparation, planning, and research, in particular for a 5-day Design sprint.

## Review
**This section includes observations by peer reviewers**
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> What were the key results?



Some of the key results of the experiment include:

Bringing together relevant stakeholders to work on a common topic (co-creation) 

Developing and testing a prototype with end-users and stakeholders

Positioning UNDP in the field of SMEs and startups among various stakeholders, particularly in front of the Ministry of Economy and Prime Minister's Office

Creating a prototype portal that serves as a first step towards supporting economic activity on a larger scale in Serbia, specifically for SMEs, startups, IT entrepreneurs, and innovative businesses

Establishing and maintaining positive relationships with national partners, such as the Ministry of Economy and the Prime Minister's Office

Gaining valuable insights about SMEs and startups, which can inform future programming for the office.

Overall, the experiment successfully achieved its goals and created a tangible solution that could positively impact the economic growth of Serbia.



> What were the key insights of this experiment?

The experiment provided several key insights. Firstly, by utilizing the Design Thinking methodology and user-centric tools, the project was able to avoid serious mistakes and errors that could have resulted from the original assumptions about the content and structure of the portal. Secondly, despite the assumption that access to finance was the most pressing requirement, the startups identified 'networking' as the most important issue, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive view of the startup ecosystem. Lastly, the project's success was attributed to the ability to gather feedback from users, which allowed for changes and improvements to be made to the portal at an early stage to better meet their needs. These insights highlight the importance of utilizing user-centric approaches in designing solutions for startups and the value of incorporating feedback loops into the design process.

> Any observations about the methodology?

As the Head of Experimentation within the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Serbia, it has been observed that the Design Thinking methodology utilized for the social innovation "Creating a startup Web portal using Design Thinking methodology and user-centric tools" was an innovative approach to problem-solving. This methodology prioritizes user-centric research and understanding of problems, which effectively addresses the challenges that were identified in the project.
The objective of the "Startup Portal" project was to develop an interactive prototype for a microsite within the main Entrepreneurship Web portal. To ensure the successful completion of this objective, iWe were able to deeply comprehend the issue from the viewpoint of the user by utilizing the Design Thinking approach and a variety of research techniques, including interviews, quantitative research, desk research, testing, and feedback sessions.
With the help of this approach, the developed solution was adapted to the target audience's needs while meeting a problem-solution fit. The "Startup Portal" project was successful because the Design Thinking process was used to make sure that the final prototype matched all user needs.

To make this experiment successful, a range of stakeholders were involved in the development of the digital product/prototype. The most crucial resource required for this experiment was time, which needed to be committed and utilized for preparation, planning, research, and particularly for a 5-day Design sprint.  

> What was the total time it took to implement

24 days in total (see the table attached) for conducting the experiment

> What was the approximate total budget used for the experiment (in US dollars)
