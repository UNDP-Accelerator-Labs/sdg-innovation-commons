An indigenous Fijian youth entrepreneur ‘The Maoli Chef’ has made a business out of making and selling meat alternatives such as homemade firm tofu pack, tofu balls, and veggie patties. After the initial success of his products, he went on to expand his product offerings and now offers healthy plant-based breakfast, lunch and dinner meals that can be delivered anywhere within the Suva area.

The Maoli Chef can be found on Facebook and Instagram, with a full display of product offerings and weekly menu updates.

The aim of this business is to encourage other Pacific islanders to eat healthier and reduce meat consumption.
