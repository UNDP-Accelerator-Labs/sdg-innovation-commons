Growing maize is a very interesting thing and very difficulty on the other hand  when you put the seeds on the ground that is when your journey starts .my main aim if cultivating maize is to make  people not to go hungry without the stepple food because here in our country zambia we rely mainly of maize aside from that I wanted to make my capital so that my family and  neighborhood should not go hungry.and when I achieve my goals my plan is to be a commercial farmer so that I can help in feeding the nation
