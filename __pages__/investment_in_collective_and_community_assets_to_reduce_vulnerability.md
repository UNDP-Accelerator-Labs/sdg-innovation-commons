> Project

Social Capital Learning Loop

> Description

An original survey conducted by AccLabPy during the pandemic as part our learning loop on Social Capital and Vulnerability, we identified a statistically significant and negative relationship between the participation in the production, maintenance, and use of community commons or collective assets and economic vulnerability. Based on this, interventions aimed at participatory design of community commons hold great promise for reducing vulnerability of the territories.
