Door Racks

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Walking in the dark allies of Al-Balad leading to the more lively area where most items are sold, this fabric shop caught my attention. As people would usually continue straight to the busy area and not think to look left as it leads to a dead end, the vendors of this shop created this hack as a way to attract visitors and display their fabrics as a form of marketing. This was done by simply screw-driving metal rails on the doors.
