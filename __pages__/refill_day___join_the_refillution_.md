Plastic Pollution Challenge: Plastic Pollution Challenge Single-use plastics, are leaked into the environment every minute causing a variety of problems, such as: Choking our rivers and oceans;  Killing animals both on land and in the water; Entering our food chain;  Creating human health problems. Unfortunately, in many cases there are no convenient alternatives to purchasing products in plastic bottles or bags, which leads to more use of virgin plastics and leaking of plastic waste into the environment.

Innovation: Refill Đây is an innovation synthesizing two existing ideas that no one else has tried before: motorbike delivery and refill stores. In many ways, it is similar to Mailing and DVDs, which is how Netflix started. The issue with refill stores is accessibility of both location and product brand. The refill shops require customers to come to the store with their containers. This is problematic if one lives far from the store as it is easier to just go to the local convenience store. Additionally, these refill shops tend to sell 100% all-natural and expensive brands that most customers have never heard of. By delivering well-known, trusted brands to the consumers’ doorstep, Refill Đây addresses both of these problems and brings an innovative new concept to the marketplace.
