> Title of the innovation

Train monitormonitoring and management system

> Brief description of the innovation

This system will monitor the position of the train and collect data to be used to schedule trains .the system will also provide information management to the user about the status of equipments in the train

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Improve acuracy in scheduling times the train arrives at stations.this saves traveller's time and increases customer trust in the transport system.Hence more customers mean more cash 
Bussiness people will be attracted as the will have real time updates of the position of their goods in transit.
Equipment failure can be quickly identified and loged in database to avoid future failures and relevant authorities informed to take action quickly

> Technical Feasibility

To access real time position of the train, the system will use GPS systems and satellite.the system will also use artificial intelligence to predict the position and astimated time of arrival to particular areas given the speed and weather variables

> Anticipated Social Impact

Small businesses can afford to transport and monitor their products on transit at affordable train charges hence will encourage then to conduct business arround the line of rail.
The railway stations will have data of the number of passengers and available seats.this will help them know how many tickets are to be sold per station .
Travelling by rail will be more enjoyable with less unexpected inciviniencies
