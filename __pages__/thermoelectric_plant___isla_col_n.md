> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The largest island in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, Isla Colón, has a plant that began operations on December 26, 2013 through a plug-and-play configuration of generators housed in 40-foot containers; 6 units in total, one of 1360 kW and the others of 1825 kW. The generators are connected by means of a step-up transformer to a 13.8 kV bar from which, through a three-phase recloser, energy is dispatched to this important area for more than 8,000 inhabitants of this tourist sector of the country, which also includes the Carenero islands. and Bastiments. Its average demand is almost 3000 kW and it increases more than 30% for times of high tourist influx, for example for the Sea Fair held between September 13 and 18.

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- No

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Proven implementation of product, service or process at scale

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

It has been diffused in 18 isolated areas of Panama. We could get user-feedback, but it is unclear how. 

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

No, but the analysis could be done. 

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Yes, as this solution is deployed under a contract from the distributions company, maybe an expansion would require the navigation of the current contract/national regulations and the capacity of the company to expand. However, the equipment they use is imported, it is not manufactured in Panama.
