> Description of the solution

The Air Pollutant Emission Assessment guide enables businesses to create a global overview of their air pollution emissions along the value chain as a way to spur actions to reduce emissions. Enabling a baseline analysis of a company's global air pollution emissions is a crucial first step to setting the stage for mitigating action. It can also make it possible to undertake health or other impact assessment analyses. By using the guidance, IKEA has set a baseline. This will enable IKEA to study the impact of existing mitigation strategies and ways to increase ambition through air pollution-specific mitigation measures. The guidance makes it possible to set a baseline for air emissions, and the result will be presented in the annual IKEA sustainability report.
