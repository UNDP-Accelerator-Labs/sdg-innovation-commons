> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated from selling of farm produce ( Flesh maize, vegetables and livestock) at an affordable price  . Am pretty sure that after every growing season, I’ll be able to generate enough income to pay workers and help the production grow. My target is super markets, so that  people will be able to consume healthy and nutritious foods.
I’m doing Organic farming which helps and improves soil fertility and does not destroy the soil and the environment.
