Time Banks are a proven strategy to promote community engagement, lower social isolation, and meet needs using the skills and talent already in a local community. The time bank is a connector linking people who have needs with volunteers who are available to provide a needed service to their neighbours, like child or elder care needs, cooking a meal, providing transport, teaching a skill or a class, offering IT support, etc. Time spent providing services is “banked” on a simple software platform and entitles provider to receive other services (I bake you a pie and your son shovels my sidewalk)
