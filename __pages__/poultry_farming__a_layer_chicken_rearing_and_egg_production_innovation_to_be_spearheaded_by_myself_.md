> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will aim at rearing layer chickens for egg production and with improved capacities going forward there should be possibility of breaking into the rearing of broiler chickens.
Rather than just relying on commercially bred birds we also want our innovation to partly act as trial center for locally bred or indigenous breeds to see how they would fare as layers when raised in conventional standards.
Land for setting up the project of any scope or magnitude is readily available either on established school grounds or in the outer customary areas where the headman and the chief will obviously assist.
Our projection is to start with a minimum of 100 commercially bred chicks and 50 locally bred pullets with 10 cocks in separate houses
The school and community effort has the necessary manpower and know-how to construct the chicken houses and for a start provide them the basic nesting and caging facilities but going forward improvements can be by made by fitting them with more durable and sustainable materials

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

There's already a huge market for poultry products in the Luapula province of Zambia and beyond. Increased demand has also been necessitated by depletion of fish stocks in the rivers. Increased population in the valley areas has also necessitated the need for alternative sources of protein nutrients and chicken meat and eggs are proving to be the best. This is helping to draw many families away from over dependancy on fish and marine animals thereby cutting down on pollution levels and allowing them breeding time

In addition the neighbouring Congo DR provide a lot of potential for the export market. The innovation once implemented will create many opportunities for women and the youth as middle participants in product sales. Chicken meat and eggs are both able to provide a readily available recipe for owners of recreation and hospitality facilities including lodges and restaurants which provide employment to many young people. In addition small farmers and gardeners will have a cheaper source of chicken manure for their ventures leading to a cut down in the use of chemical fertilisers

> Technical Feasibility

We intend to start with one chicken house of about 4×20m dimension. Where resources may not allow inner fittings such as caging and nesting facilities can be fitted using wooden materials although this may not be viable due to a heavy termite infestation 

The chicken house is to be constructed on a 1 hectare land so as to leave enough room for future expansion. Local labour and expertise is readily available to help with construction works

A home grown community based group, Tufuntule Kawama was last year a beneficiary of the government's empowerment program for which they were given chicken layers for a similar project. However the project couldn't succeed and the reasons for the failure will be the lessons learnt to build on for this innovation. 

Members of the Tufuntule group were instrumental in the moulding of 20,000 bricks for the expansion of the local school (a 1×4 classroom block) and are herewith more than willing to share their experience as stakeholders. 
All things being equal our proposal is that the first phase of the project be implemented within a 6 months period

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will have several social multiplier effects beginning with an immediate impact on levels of income generation. Money raised from sales would go a long way in raising the basic living standards among community members including women and youths. 

Involvement of the school and it's young learners will imply that the innovation will also act as a skills and knowledge transferring center. This is one of the key forward linkages we intend to encourage and foster. Going forward appropriate elements of modern technologies shall be incorporated for purposes of both education and its sustainability. 

The relevance of chicken rearing in this area is an inevitable imperative to food security and its effective utilisation.
It will attract positive synergies in the area of health and nutrition leading to enhanced commucation channels between the community and the experts providing extension services hence promoting the transfer of knowledge and skills among stakeholders.
It will contribute to diversification and equity in the food market which is currently dominated by maize
