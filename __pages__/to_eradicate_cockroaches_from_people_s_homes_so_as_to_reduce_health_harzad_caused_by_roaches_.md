> Title of the innovation

To eradicate cockroaches from people's homes so as to reduce health harzad caused by roaches.

> Brief description of the innovation

We want to expand our business with the aim of reducing health harzads caused by cockroaches. Our product is known by few people, so we have taken this opportunity to innovate it on large scale so that if possible we will be able to reach to many people as possible.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

At a moment we just do door to door sale with few individuals due to lack of funds. With this innovation we are hoping to be suppliers to super markets, groceries, pharmacies etc. The benefits are that if people can access this product in stores, then it will be easy to reach out to so many, hence helping a large number of homes eradicating roaches.

> Technical Feasibility

We use simple ingredients we buy from local shops, such as foods and chemicals including bottles and labels. Recently we atempt to get a loan so as to expand our business but it failed due to the eligibility required. So we only depend on selling at least 10 bottles a day to few individuals.

> Anticipated Social Impact

If we will be able to supply to many shops, then it will mean more production hence employing more people to help us in production and marketing. Then to those who buy including those who order, it means reducing cockroaches and creating more business opportunities.
