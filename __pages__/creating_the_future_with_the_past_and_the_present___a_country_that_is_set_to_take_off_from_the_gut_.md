CREATING THE FUTURE WITH THE PAST AND THE PRESENT . A COUNTRY THAT IS SET TO TAKE OFF FROM THE GUTTERS OF IRRESPONSIBILITY AND LUCK OF VISION HAS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE IT'S PARADIGM WITH THE OLD ,THE HOMELESS AND IT'S PRIVATE SECTOR WITH INCLUSIVENESS. OLD AGE HOMES , HOMELESSNESS SKILL TRAINING

> Brief description of the innovation

A COUNTRY'S IDEA OF DEVELOPMENT STABILITY IS BASED ON ITS INNOVATION ABILITIES, BUT THIS SHOULD EXTEND TO THE FACT THAT SOCIAL WELFARE  CAN PROVE TO BE A VIABLE COMPONENT OF ANY GROWING SOCIETY, WITH THE GROWING TREND IN POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMS BASED ON THE PRESIDENT'S OVERVIEW OF A COUNTRY'S PARADIGM IN THIS ERA, MY VIEW OF A BETTER ZAMBIA IS TO STRENGTHEN THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM LIKE SUPPORTING OLD AGE HOMES, HOMELESSNESS INCLUSIVENESS WHICH INVOLVES THE PRIVATE SECTOR LIKE ME WITH THE IDEA AND A PIECE OF LAND THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED INTO A MORDEN STRUCTURE  FOR SKILL SET. IN THIS CASE THE DISABLED CAN BE ASSISTED, THE OLD CAN HAVE A PEACE OF MIND, THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WILL HAVE HOPE GOING INTO THE FUTURE, THE STREETS WILL BE FULL OF HOPEFUL PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS EFFORT TO REDUCE POVERTY WILL BE SUPPORTED BY WORKABLE STRUCTURES THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE CULTURAL SECTOR OF OUR GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

ANY COUNTRY WITH WELL-DESIGNED STRUCTURES IN PLACE CAN INVIGORATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WHEN THE PLAYERS ARE HAPPY SO ARE THEIR PLANS TO GROW THEIR INVESTMENTS. WE WILL ENGAGE  THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE CITIZENS WILL HAVE AN EASY JOB TO IMPLEMENT AND ARTICULATE GOVERNMENT MANIFESTO THROUGH INNOVATION AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT. WE WILL VIGOROUSLY THROUGH SKILL TRAINING ENGAGE MORE PEOPLE SO AS TO BRING IN MONEY AS THEY ENJOY OUR SERVICES. USUALLY, WHEN ORGANISATIONS ARE INVOLVED IN CARRYING OUT CERTAIN TASKS, THERE IS ALWAYS EFFICIENCY AND MARKET ACTIVITIES INCREASED AND MORE BUSINESSES HAVE THE STABILITY.  A PROJECT IS NOTHING IF IT DOES NOT START, ONCE WHAT'S ON PAPER TAKES OFF THEN POTENTIALITY CAN BE MEASURED, HOWEVER, THE TARGET MARKET IS EVERYONE WHO HAS NO TIME OR MONEY TO CARE FOR A RELATIVE, THEY CAN MAKE A BIG COMPANY TO TARGET. WE WILL HAVE TO START REARING CHICKENS  BASED ON OUR SURVIVAL KNOW-HOW. IF GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE RESOURCES MY IDEA WILL NOT DIE BUT REDEEM AND CHANGE THE WAY ORPHANAGES AND OLD AGE HOMES ARE RUN. I WOULD LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TO START TAKING CARE OF ITS SOCIAL WELFARE WITHOUT PARTIALITY BUT WITH HOPE.

> Technical Feasibility

THE FIRST THING THAT NEEDS TO WORK OUT IS TO HAVE A BUILDING READY SINCE A SMALL PIECE OF LAND EXISTS.  THE PIECE OF LAND IS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, ACTUALLY, THAT IS WHY IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY A CONVENIENT AREA TO MAKE USE OF. THE 2 HECTARES PIECE OF LAND IS NEAR ELECTRIC CABLES FOR ZESCO. THE BUILDING SHOULD HAVE A CLEAN TOILET AND BATHROOM. THE CLINIC IS ALSO ALREADY NEARBY. THE PLACE SHOULD HAVE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS VISITING EVERY WEEKEND OR ONCE IN A WHILE TO CATCH UP.  THIS IDEA IS A REINVENTION OF HOW SOCIAL WELFARE IS SUPPOSED TO BE, A WAY THAT WILL MAKE PARTNERS AND RELATIVES EXCITED AND REALLY BEGIN TO FEEL ALIVE AGAIN, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THE GOVERNMENT ENTHUSIASTIC TOO AND BE ABLE TO HELP OUT.  I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT WITH A CARING GOVERNMENT IN PLACE IDEAS LIKE THIS ONE CAN LIVE. WE CAN LOBBY IN ORDER TO EMPLOY SO AS TO BE ABLE TO PAY SOME PEOPLE  AS WELL AS PROVIDING TRANSPORT THAT CAN STAND DUE TO THE GRAVEL ROADS ESPECIALLY IN RAIN SEASON. WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE CLEAN WATER AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY DEALING WITH PEOPLE.

> Anticipated Social Impact

THE PROJECT IS MORE OF HUMAN CAPITAL BASED AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE WILL INCREASE THE GENERAL PERCEPTION THAT OUR COUNTRY IS ACTUALLY LED BY A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD A VISION BEFORE THEY PUT IT ON PAPER FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE  NEGLECTED BY SOCIETY AND NEED PEOPLE LIKE US TO INTERVENE AND HELP BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A GOOD SOCIETY WITH HUMAN VALUES AND NORMS DOES EXIST. THE STREETS WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE SPACE BECAUSE ONLY A FEW STREET KIDS WILL BE AVAILABLE, WITH EXPANSION PROGRAMS AHEAD SOME MEN AND WOMEN WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FOR THE ORGANIZATION. WE WILL ENGAGE IN SOME AREAS OF PROFIT-MAKING LIKE REARING CHICKENS WITHIN THE PREMISE TO SUSTAIN OUR EXISTENCE. WHEN YOU HAVE STRONG PROGRAMS THAT WILL AFFECT PEOPLE, YOUR LIFE SHOULD GET ASSISTED TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE THE REASONS FOR ALL INNOVATION PROGRAMS. PROJECTS THAT FACILITATE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY COMPLETELY SELF-MOTIVATED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELFLESS IN NATURE REGARDLESS OF AGE, GENDER AND EDUCATION. ANYTHING GOOD SHALL HELP RESUSCITATE AN AILING ECONOMY AND THEREBY ADDRESS THE MOST CRUCIAL ISSUES OF SOCIAL INJUSTICES.
