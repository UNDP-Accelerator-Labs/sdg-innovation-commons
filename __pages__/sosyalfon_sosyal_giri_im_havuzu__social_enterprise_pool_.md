Sosyalfon is a system-level social enterprise set out to solve the financial scaling problems of social enterprises and to bring together and support all actors working within the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. With its B2B model (Sosyalfon Social Enterprise Pool), it acts as a bridge between social enterprises and institutions and with the data set it uses, it ensures that the collaborations between these actors are systematized and carried out with maximum efficiency.
