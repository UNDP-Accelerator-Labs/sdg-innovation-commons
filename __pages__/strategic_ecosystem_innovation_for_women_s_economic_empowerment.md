## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Demonstrating evidence can help reshape our approach to finding solutions. When we initiated the first phase of our challenge, which involved creating an evidence-based map, stakeholders were surprised by the data. The map presented key evidence of gender gaps collected by the government and NGOs. Although not new information, we organized it into three women autonomies (economic, physical, and decision-making autonomies) and demonstrated their interconnectedness. Observing the thematic map allows one to comprehend the complex reality women experience, enabling consideration of all variables when designing new solutions. For instance, when we shared the map with a representative from Startups Bolivia, he mentioned that viewing the data collectively helped them envision how new digital products should be.  The second phase is focused on mapping current solutions and inthe third phase we will compare gaps with current solutions like inputs to identigy where innovation is needed.

Implementing an ecosystem approach requires critical mass. The five organizations engaged in the challenge successfully presented the evidence-based map publicly. However, the next step, creating the solutions map, necessitates the involvement of more stakeholders to instigate a shift in mindset beyond just presenting data and maps. Therefore, we plan to involve additional partners in the second and third phases of the challenge in 2024.

Working with the ecosystem requires establishing principles and concepts from the beginning. Despite sounding basic, this is crucial. Collaborating with ecosystem institutions demands equalizing information and knowledge. Throughout our journey, we recognized that some basic concepts, like innovation, are misunderstood, often sought for novelty rather than impact. Therefore, working with the ecosystem is a process that requires a solid foundation, including establishing the main concepts and principles that will guide the initiative.

The challenge is not yet complete; we have successfully completed the first of the three steps, achieving some notable results, including the addition of important partners such as the Chamber of Commerce, Startups Bolivia Foundation, Global Compass, among others. Next year, we plan to proceed with the implementation of the challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

An integrated issue map, illustrating gender gaps, highlighted the complexity of considering economic empowerment for women comprehensively. Additionally, a collaborative approach with organizational partners assisted us in presenting the map most effectively to achieve its objectives.   

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Participatory design enabled the group of organizations leading this initiative to craft it with insights that exceeded the sum of its parts. Visual thinking and mapping served as crucial tools for representing the data we discovered, such as a gender gap evidence-based map. This map is currently being utilized with key stakeholders in the ecosystems to foster collective intelligence processes. System thinking served as the foundation for the initiative, aiming to transition from a siloed perspective to a portfolio perspective.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The system approach, coupled with visual thinking and mapping, proved crucial in providing a resource for transforming the mindset of the main stakeholders in the ecosystem. This shift involves moving from a one-dimensional (or a few dimensions) approach to defining problems and solutions to a multidimensional and multistakeholder perspective to improve the solutions impact in the gender gaps closure.
