On the principles to look and try to find what best we can identify as innovation, we have been running our safari around Touyah beach. In normal situation it is a kind of waste dropping zone but according to what I had in front was really surprising. Because of the fact that we found the area that was before considered as nasty by the tones of collected wastes from the direct deposit of men and also all the raining water that was leading the wastes through the water coming from the area sides all around; clean with new restaurants at both sides of the road.


By discussing, we have seen from something like 300m a kind of rounded base all around flowers and my collegue and I have decided to just try to be closer and bingo! "Funny!!! are these guys, has said my collegue."


for the first point of view this was for us a joke. How can he be using tires as flowerpots? 
Some  10 to 15m later, we come to realize by seeing the complete line of tires that was used to change the state of the area. For the Owner, "this was for me a solution to avoid two cases: 


1- Fight against Air pollution as we cannot burn or incinarate without smoke!
2- Be submerged by falty tires and not be able to do something against, would certainly lead to the degradation and pollution of the environnement."


So please if you have faulty tires and you realy do not have idea for avoiding the incinaration please give a look at this solution and just let us know how it helps to transform things around you!
