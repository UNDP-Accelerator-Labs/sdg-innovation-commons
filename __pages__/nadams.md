> Description of the solution

NADAMS project, developed by National Remote Sensing Centre, provides near real-time information on prevalence, severity level and persistence of agricultural drought at state/ district/sub-district level. The assessment is carried out using rainfall, Remote Sensing Vegetation Index and Moisture adequacy Index during the Kharif season. Since its inception, the NADAMS project has seen numerous improvements in methodology and technology. These advancements include the use of moderate resolution data for more detailed assessments, the use of multiple indices for drought evaluation, and the synchronization of ground observations with satellite-based interpretation. The system now provides user-friendly information through the following methods: 1. Utilizing multiple satellite data, 2. Analyzing rainfall indicators, 3. Examining soil moisture index, 4. Conducting ground observations.
