## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) The pandemic triggered an unprecedented demand for digital technology solutions from the government to ensure continuity of critical services and accelerating recovery. The need for technology in services opened a new and exciting space for experimentation not just in the private sector but also in the government. So, we set out to test a model for a public-private partnership for government technologies within the context of the pandemic. The lab team partnered with the Ministry of Innovation and Technology to enlist local innovators in a pilot initiative intended to digitize critical government functions linked to business continuity.  Seven solutions were selected across 8 challenge areas and enrolled into a business incubation program led by X-Hub Addis to refine their products and create an MVP to experiment.     2) From this model of public-private partnership, we learned several things that are worth mentioning.    - From the demand side: Government institutions have a strong appetite and optimism for digital tools that can simplify their lives and help them serve people better. They have clear ideas about what they want and need, but the challenge is having the infrastructure and technical know-how to implement these digital tools. Urgent investments in training staff quickly to understand and apply revised procedures and protocols and using virtual methods are needed.  - From the supply side: Many entrepreneurs are interested in building digital service tools and have taken up the cause independently to explore the solutions on their end. We saw some applications which have reached prototype level and are testing their tools with government institutions at regional levels. They are self-starters who are building their technical know-how and bringing it to the marketplace.   The Market: While still in the middle of seeing how the piloting and solution refining goes, we saw a real need for a structured process that can create room for smaller technology companies and start-ups to develop their competencies alongside the government. Governments can provide an opportunity to accelerate digital technologies, especially true for Ethiopia, where there is a need to grow the private and technology sector. Here the government can create a conducive environment but also in leading by example.     3) The transformation to digital solutions is critical to support business continuity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, Ethiopia suffers from poor connectivity, which is not necessarily an issue of resources, just one of prioritization. Ultimately, in the medium to long term, UNDP will use this intervention to advocate for policy reform to allow for increased connectivity across the country. In the meantime, the establishment of alternate working arrangements and workflows, use of innovative solutions including ICT will create the appetite for the adoption of e-governance and e-service provision for key functions, encouraging online rather than in-person contact. The support for product and business development support for the innovators includes training on how to build their capacity to continuously innovate on their solutions and approaches beyond selling their products.     4) The lab undertook a survey in and around Ethiopia’s budding industrial parks to understand the perception of the pandemic amongst the thousands of employees of the parks. In the process of identifying key issues that worried them most, one that attracted our attention most was their worry about getting infected, going through the horrifying effects, being subjected to stigma, and even most important, not being able to support their families. As part of the COVID-19 response plan, the lab team partnered with the Industrial Park Development Corporation and VIAMO, a mobile tech company to develop an awareness creation campaign to empower employees to keep themselves safe and create a positive work environment.  VIAMO’s platform allowed us to reach close to 20,000 workers across the country who speak multiple languages and have varying literacy levels. Making sense of the vast amounts of data collected within the industrial park through implanting the digital innovation and visualizing it helped to support IPDC revisit its business continuity plans and take some corrective measures for continuity of their function.  5) The ongoing pandemic has taught us that partnership is key for accelerating solutions. The above-mentioned initiative showcased how we delivered and impacted our beneficiaries through collaboration, community engagement, and an unusual way of doing things. We proved that behavioral change communication campaigns can be enhanced using digital technologies like Voice-based Information services, targeted mass messaging campaigns, mobile surveys, social media chatbot campaigns, gamification, and data visualizations.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- Government services public satisfaction data was not easily accessible, while digitizing of government services could embed these types of data that will be used for product redesigning and iterative testing.  -  There was also the bottleneck of overlapping mandates between institutions  in digitizing government services that at times prevented organizations from implementing their own system and waiting for servies form federal or renal levels. This prevented us from creating the experimentation and piloting scenarios at some offices.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Open data: we used existing data to analyze Government services public satisfaction data that is used for product redesigning and iterative testing.    Focused group discussion and direct interview: To understand particularly the government agencies need on what kind of digital solution they need for embedding public innovation for continuity of their critical government activities and functions, the lab team used this method to explore and sense more. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Prototyping and Co-creation used in allowing the winning solution and the government institutions to test and co-design the solutions in ways that best fit both the citizen’s and the institution's needs.   Human Centered Design is used to make sure the proposed solution is addressing the issues it set out to solve in ways that serve the purpose.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Yes    - Ethiopian Innovators Association supported us in the mapping of local solutions as well as proving technical support during the evaluation process.  

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Yes    - X-HUB: support us with creating a robust and knowledgeable innovator, who build, sustain, and grow start-ups and early-stage companies throughout their evolution (incubation) as well as provide focused assistance (acceleration) which enables them to achieve objectives quickly.       - VIAMO  

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Yes    - Ministry of Innovation and Technology (MINT) did host the challenge grant from the government side by creating a technical working group composed of relevant agencies, supporting the evaluation process, and officially recognizing the winners at a national level. Which leads to the scaling stage.  - TechIN  - Industrial Parks Development Corporation (IPDC) 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

X-HUB, VIAMO and Ethiopian Innovators Association were new and unusual partners for UNDP. The CO mostly work only with the government partners and bringing these partners enable us to draw quick and different insight. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

- Using unusual data sources as well as bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight with a short period of time in different topics and diversify learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implementing in a previous implementation form. It enables us to see different insights which we didn’t see in the normal project implementation ways. It also enables us to use fewer resources since we have done many activities through collaboration with other partners which makes the lab approach less resource incentive method. These methods also help us to accelerate the internal UNDP operation process using partnership rather than a procurement process to save time as well provide evidence in a short period of time for decision making.
