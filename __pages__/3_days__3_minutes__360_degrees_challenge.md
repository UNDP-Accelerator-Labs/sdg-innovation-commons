## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

May 6th 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Digital Innovation and Inclusion

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Use of digital technology to showcase Caribbean spaces, environments and experiences.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

·       Can 360 cameras and virtual reality technology be used to enhance the experiences of persons with disabilities?

·       Can upskilling content creators on the use of 360 cameras and virtual reality for film lead to the design of immersive content.

·       Can VR/immersive content be used to promote unique tourism offerings of MSMEs in the Caribbean?



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Some members of the Caribbean society are unable to physically experience attractions or places of interest within their country or regionally because of cost, disability, or fear of travel. While Virtual Reality (VR) and 360-degree cameras provide an avenue for accessing immersive content on attractions and valuable experiences, the skills and tools required to create such content are not readily available.

Can a 3 Day immersive session enable youth to create 360 VR content of Caribbean spaces based on the following themes:

Youth and Crime
Tourism 
Nature and the Environment 

Can Caribbean youth after a 3 Day session on capturing VR content be capable of participating in a group innovation challenge?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If youth can create VR content after being exposed to a 3 Day session on 360 capturing and design then persons with disabilities can have access to virtual experiences which they may be unable to experience physically through the content created by youth

If youth can create VR content after being exposed to a 3 Day session on 360 capturing and design then youth programmes in this area can be rolled out in a short time to increase the number of immersive videos of Caribbean spaces.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

A panel of judges in the areas of Communications, Video design and Creation to determine the quality and provide feedback on the videos create after 3 days of exposure to the technology.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Quality of the 3 group videos after exposure to 360 technology for 3 days.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

A panel of judges in the areas of Communications, Video design and Creation to determine the quality and provide feedback on the videos create after 3 days of exposure to the technology.

Qualitative data captured via feedback forms.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 Week

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes youth were able to complete the challenge and the judging panel gave great reviews after just 3 days exposure.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Have members of the panel be a person with a disability.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

1 month

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

3000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Expansion by the ministry to other programmes.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The Ministry is interested in running another programme this project can also be scaled regionally among the creative sector.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity
