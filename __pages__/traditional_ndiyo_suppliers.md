Income for the inovation will be generated from sales of village chickens, village chicken eggs ,village chicken sausage and dog feed from bones left when processing sausage. Most of the products will be given at order prices so that others will benefit and generate income for themselves. The target is house holds , boarding schools and hotels.

I want to start with 200 female chickens  and 10 male chickensWich will save as parent stock on the ratio 1:20. Once they start laying eggs we will be getting the eggs and put in incubators for hatching the chicks will be kept and processed into sausage after six months. Within a year I will be able to meet the demands of chipata district and other districts around chipata after 2 years the goal is to meet the demands of about 3 provinces .
