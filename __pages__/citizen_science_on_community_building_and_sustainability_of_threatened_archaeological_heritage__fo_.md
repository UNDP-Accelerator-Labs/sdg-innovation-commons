## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process.
## Overall goal

Co-creatively build scientific knowledge for the management and protection of archaeological heritage linked to the process of expansion and configuration of national frontiers in interaction to the indigenous societies in the Pampa and Patagonia regions during the 19th century in the district of Tres Arroyos (Buenos Aires).
## Specific goals

Build a map of local stakeholders focusing on interests, needs, perceptions, and issues related to the fortlets.

Collaboratively expand the information on the location, characterization, and state of conservation of the fortlets.

Contribute to the awareness-raising within local communities in relation to the importance and safeguarding of archaeological heritage sites as part of a sustainable environment to mitigate the damage and destruction of the fortlets.

Develop joint strategies for the conservation of the fortlets, their monitoring, and promotion.
## Description of citizen participation

Staff from museums, municipal institutions, neighbors, and detectorists from the Tres Arroyos district along with professional scientists participates jointly and actively in the different stages of research. During the diagnostic and presentation stage, discussion meetings and interviews are held to record interests, knowledge, and issues related to the fortlets, training workshops on historical archaeology and its activities are carried out. Then, in the “scientific work” stage, they participate in the formulation of hypothesis and the search for documentary and bibliographic sources in the Mulazzi and Aníbal Paz museums as well as in digital repositories about local fortlets. In turn, they work on locating and managing access to private farms where the sites and lodgings are located; in the planning and logistics of field work; in carrying out archaeological (collection and excavations) and geophysical surveys (with metal detectors) in fortlets; in the classification and analysis of materials recovered in field work and from public and private archaeological collections. Likewise, they discuss the proposed hypotheses, results and interpretations in a participatory manner, in various task groups according to the institutions and places of belonging. In a final stage, archeology and heritage meetings and workshops are held to promote identification, awareness and enhancement of heritage to contribute to its care and safeguarding.
