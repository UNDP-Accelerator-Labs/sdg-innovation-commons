> Brief description of the innovation

At present, there are 3 facets to the business operations:
1.Supply of Solar Powered Lamps/Lights – Kuyasa Trademarked and designed solar powered products for mass distribution that are ready for market.
2. Solar Home Systems -  Kuyasa Trademarked and designed Solar Home systems of various capacities for mass distribution that are ready for market
3  Large Scale Renewables – A sweeping landscsape that produces enough energy for an entire community. Solar Farms and large-scale renewable solutions provide a cost-effective, reliable and long-term source of power on a grand scale.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Key focus areas in which the undertaking is to commence will be, the capital city of Zambia, Lusaka before expanding services to other provinces of Zambia. Lusaka has a large urban and rural population for example, and we would seek to power as many homes and businesses over an initial 12 month period.
Unlike fossil fuels, solar power emits no carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and utilizing solar energy results in a lower amount of greenhouse gasses being emitted into the atmosphere. Other benefits of this technology include:
•	Displacement of diesel and the saving of money
•	Protection against price rises of fossil fuels and grid electricity supply
•	Improved security, reliability and quality of electricity supply
•	Better energy use visibility and management
•	Greater control of energy infrastructure including individual metering
•	Reduction in emissions, carbon footprint and environmental impacts
The Challenge Prize will assist in providing strategic mentorship, outside evaluation and capital investment towards continual product development, working capital and continual product delivery to the intended market.

> Technical Feasibility

RURAL  

Our bespoke products with prototypes available are already ready for market and immediate retail. 

URBAN/COMMERCIAL 

We would take a holistic approach to and with the target market with reference to its current situation by seeking to balance wants and needs. Energy Service Connections deployed would then be based on the results to the following 3 segments.

Advisory
• How much power do you use?
• What are the costs and benefits of the different options?
• What are your funding options?
• What skills and training do you need to use renewable energy successfully? 

Design
• Detailed design of the bespoke renewable energy solution
• Design of the connection to your operations
• Design and connection application for your Utility connection
• Metering and control to make sure you get all the benefits available
• Full drawings and documentation of the solution

Construction
• Procurement of equipment and delivery to site
• Assembly and Installation with minimal disruption to your operations
• Opportunity for your team to be involved and trained during installation
• Full testing to confirm you get the benefits expected

> Anticipated Social Impact

Currently, energy solutions in the current market are either of poor quality and/or are too expensive or are not reliable or available at all. As a result our focus is on the distribution and supplying of quality, affordable, renewable, self-sufficient, energy saving and light generating products and devices. These shall act as sources of light and energy for the vast number of the population in various areas of the country. What Kuyasa will do differently is what hasn’t seemed to have happened yet in the African renewable energy space, which is the provision of "high quality, low cost, multifunctional, customer centric" solutions to the energy deficit
