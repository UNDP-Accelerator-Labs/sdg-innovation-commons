## 

&nbsp;Its objective for 2021, with the support of CBC and Social Capital Foundation, is to design a sustainable and comprehensive business model for women recyclers in the Lake Atitlán Basin, which will contribute to reducing the contamination of the lake and at the same time generate income to improve their quality of life and that of their families.
