> Title of the innovation

Timber production and tree planting

> Brief description of the innovation

To enhance mass timber production ana mass tree planting for continuity of the whole process.the aim is to plant ten tree in replacing one tree that has been cut or fallen

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Timber is one commodity that almost every industry use,as such its production is cardinal to a number of economic activities. Therefore, it is imperative that its production is maximized and planting of trees is continuous so that the environment is endangered.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed in such a way that it needs extra efforts from the initiator

> Anticipated Social Impact

If the production is done in masses then there will be need of extra human resource as such some will be employed full time and part time basis.And through the planting of trees the whole global village will benefit as there will be reduction global warming and uncertainties in rainfall pattern.
