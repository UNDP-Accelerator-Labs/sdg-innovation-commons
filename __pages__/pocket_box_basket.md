Innovator: Dalida J Borlasa

Dalida came up with the idea of upcycling plastic materials, fabrics and dried pandanus leaves. She created a pocket box basket with several slots that can be used to put phones, ID cards, and an extra slot for a shopping bag. It can be used as a wallet and it has a neck rope that is made of fabric. There is also a placeholder for hand sanitisers.  It is easy to carry around and will help reduce plastic pollution around Port Vila.
