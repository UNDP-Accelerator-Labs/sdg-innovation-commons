Certain insects found in nature - gabrobracons, trichograms and lacewings  - can be used to control insects that damage crops. These farmer's natural aids has been used for many years in large cotton and grain fields as one of the effective methods to prevent spread of other harmful insects. Application of these 'useful' insects in orchards has been re-invented recently with the assistance of UNDP in Uzbekistan as an important part of integrated pest management and promoting green agriculture in pilot region in Namangan Region of Fergana Valley.
