> Description

An important barrier to sustainable waste management is the low level of separation of recyclable waste at the point of origin. A redesigned and optimized version of the typical street-side waste basket used by most households can facilitate better sorting behavior. This toolkit, developed by AccLabPY for a "light urban interventions" contest provides instructions for households or organizations to modify existing wastebaskets.
