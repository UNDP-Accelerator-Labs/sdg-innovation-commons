## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Entrepreneurship or self-employment which seems to be a plan B or  first solution for young graduates who cannot have immediate access to the job market is not the easy way out after all. 2. Entrepreneurship for young people is a big challenge because at first thought, they did not receive practical or business skills through out their educational journey. Engaging in entrepreneurship for various reasons without the adapted skills has a direct relationship with increasing informality. 3. Employers expect professional experience even for entry level positions but are not ready to grant the relevant internships or on-the-job trainings which enable young people or graduates acquire acquire the necessary skills and could obtain a minimum level of professional experience. 4. Young people hardly receive timely career orientation and often times get interested in professions because they want to imitate or be like someone they considered a model, and not necessarily because they have the rightful skills.  skill mismatch remains a big challenge to gaining meaningful employment by young people whose skills often times do not match the needs of employers due to the general nature of education which is much more theoretical than practical. 5. Communication, information and Coordination mechanisms on employment remain another big and common challenge which cannot be ignored as employment platforms are obsolete and not adapted for user friendly experience. Excess time spent on social media networks which could also be an opportunity for accessing employers or getting a job prevents most  young people from keeping abreast with other relevant national job portals or news channels. Coordination amongst relevant employment sectors remains limited, with very little opportunities for youth to access updated data, or current job trends for better orientation.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

-Yes we did! Access to existing data on youth employment was a big barrier for the lab.  -It was difficult managing expectation partners and young people we interacted with. The idea that the lab is not a donor or an incubator was not easily understood and difficult to pass across in a context where accessing funds for start-ups is challenging.  -Also, partnering with the relevant government partners was not always evident with top officials always having different agendas and did not really permit an integration of the lab.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The selected data enabled the lab close data gaps relating to inclusive information, consideration of vulnerable groups, connecting with people directly linked to the problem and benefiting from updated and real time information that could impact development patterns and policies. Another reason was to raise awareness on innovative practices and methods to change perceptions on traditional ways of doing things. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These innovation methods were used mainly to address challenges  identified  with the adapted tools or techniques.  -Making use of artificial intelligence and machine learning enabled the lab to analyse diseases affecting cocoa farmers in large hectares of farmlands within limited time. Artificial intelligence was also used to test if diseases affecting the cocoa plant varied from one season to another to identify if these were caused by the type of inputs applied on the soil. - The lab tested gamification with the National Employment fund to adapt the digital employment platform to the needs and interest of young job seekers. Knowing youth interest in designed and animated platforms, the test was to assess if adapting and integrating new tools on the platform will increase their interaction with employers and improve access to the platform for young job seekers. - The other methods enabled us to employ more holistic approaches to sensing problems in order to identify the most appropriate solutions. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Lab worked with Civil Society Organizations while trying to understand its frontier Challenge during collective intelligence sessions, to ensure inclusive sessions that captured local realities. We worked with the Association for Community Awareness (ASCOA) on sensing opportunities for young people in the green economy sector and also with Organisation d' Appui en Ingénierie de Développement et de Maitrise d'OEuvre Sociale (OAI-DEMOS) during an innovation challenge launched within the framework of the Youth Connekt CO programme to identify best projects in the renewable energy and waste recycling sector. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The lab in Cameroon collaborated with public universities (University of Buea, Dschang, and the National school of polytechnic. . Several state and private universities besides the above mentioned participated a professional orientation fair organized by the lab to showcase available programmes and orientate students. Other times, this universities have contributed knowledge during collective intelligence sessions, sense making, and innovation challenges coordinated by the Lab. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Lab worked most of the time with  exiting National Employer Unions (ECAM & GICAM) to sense the  challenges and opportunities young people face in the Job Market. Basically during workshops, organized meetings or working group sessions.   The lab also worked with Orange digital Centre, a subsidiary of the Orange Cameroon  telecommunications company. Prototyping with youth on innovative projects in waste management, collective intelligence sessions and workshops, including drafting of an MOU to concretise  collaboration.  The Lab also interacted with private start-ups  like JABA SPACE and ACTIVE SPACES for the organization of design thinking workshops. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The lab also collaborated with national education ministries like the Ministry of Higher education to coordinate a professional orientation fair which was organized by the lab. The Lab has also engaged with the Agency for Medium and Small-scaled enterprises and its related ministry for policy advocacy to improve young peoples access to entrepreneurship. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Orange Digital Centre (ODC) was a new and unusual partner for UNDP. Besides the UNDP global strategic innovation approach and digitalization which are common points of interest for this company, what makes them special is the company's interest in promoting employability for young people and women through enhanced innovative and digitalized approaches, equipping youth with the right tools geared towards the attainment of SDGs. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Lab collaborated with United Nations Volunteer Programme to engage in a panellist session on the World  Environment Day to share knowledge on "Restoring the Ecosystem in West and Central Africa; How can UN Systems Support Existing Efforts". The lab took this as an opportunity to engage local solution holders addressing climate change issues who shared their experiences with almost over 40 UNV connected from selected West and Central African Countries, and how their solutions actually drive at ecosystem restoration. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The learning process was quite smooth especially with complementary team members

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
