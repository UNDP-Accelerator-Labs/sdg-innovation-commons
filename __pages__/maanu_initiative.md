The project is not free as subscribers will subscribe termly at a fee. My potential offtakers include the Gvt of the republic of Zambia, Corporates and organisations Aimed at improving education accessibility to students during the pandemic and even after the pandemic. 

The prize money will help the business grow as I will use it to pay the developer to fully develop the app and list it on Play store/ app store platforms for download.

> Technical Feasibility

It is an online app that is free for download on Google play store and app store. My prototype for a start, consists of a quiz and an option were a Guardian/parent can enter their email address and be notified of the learners progress. So, after the quiz, the results are sent to the guardian.
