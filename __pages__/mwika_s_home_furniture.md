> Brief description of the innovation

The common skills found at the out workshop are carpentry and joinery. We have more than 10 workers ,both hard labor and electric machines which makes  our work much easier. Dad and I we’ve been operating this workshop for than 10 years but what has been the challenge is the huge capital .There are variety of initiatives and skills which makes people of our society happy . We always think of new ideas of going forward and making our company big .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The other vital part of our workshop is that it’s situated to places where there is market for instance we usually take our sofas to solwezi ,nakonde and DR border. The respectively places have market compared to urban areas.secondly we receive consumers from different part of the country even across the country who brings business at our workshop and Zambia at large. Our workshop contains a lot of people with different skills,in that way we help one other in the community and also we do train skills to youngsters who are willing to learn.Not only that we also have sells ladies in the respectively places who sells our goods out there.

> Technical Feasibility

We have a main workshop in Copperbelt where we make sofas and transport to other places. Most of the time we receive orders in form of a post from the paper. Our main focus is to deal with anything to do with woods/timbers and give our consumers the best.we have a lot of plans on how to maintain our job/skills ,one of them is to rebuild our main work place to so we can accommodate a lot of workers.another one is improving in timber production , it has been a challenge with timber production due to shortages of timbers in our country and high prices of plakes. All in all we just want to make our workshop to be independent interms of providing materials of our own.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can help us all if we come together as a team and coordinate on one goal. And this goal is providing people with home sofas within and across the country in that way our economy will be better.
