> Title of the innovation

Urban Farming: planting common plants and vegetables in the community, and this will be done by utilising available land in the community

> Brief description of the innovation

Urban Farming is my pending idea that is considered as one of the solution to the solution that the community is facing. This idea has to be undertaken in the neighborhood which is full of negative vices , namely ; drug abuse , theft , prostitution to mention but just a few.
This idea will seek the help of an area member of parliament , to help us secure an available portion of land to practice subsistence urban farming.
The type of crops to be planted are those which are easily purchased the general public and these in include avocado plants, Mango plants , guava etc.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will be generating income by selling the plants and vegetables to the general public or particularly those interested in plants and it will have an online platform where the plants will be advertising.
The sensitisation campaign will be initiated so as to information the community about the goodness and the benefits of the plants.  And these advertisements are more likely to boost the business of plants in the community and the country at large.

> Technical Feasibility

This idea will use the available land and infrastructure which is available, at this point the youths will be educated about the dangers of drugs abuse and also about climate change how it can be reduced. Then youths will be taught where of planting vegetables and plants.. thereafter an advertisement after a couple of weeks will commence both online and physical.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This initiative comes as a result of negative vices which are currently taking place in the neighborhood. These vices pose a risk among young ones, those who are already indulging themselves and those not but the possibility of them to do so is high, reason being young people in chawama do not have recreational facilities to keep them away from bad things and also the schools do not have school club activities to keep them away from bad things. Henceforth, this initiative will keep them away from bad things and they are likely to gain their well-being due to activities that will be keeping them busy. Furthermore, this idea will build courage and passion among the members pursue careers in plant science and climate change that will help the country and the world at large as they will be heros of climate control ideas.
