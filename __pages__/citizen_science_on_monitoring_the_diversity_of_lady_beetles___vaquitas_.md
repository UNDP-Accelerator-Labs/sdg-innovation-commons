Overall goal: Identify species of Lady Beetles existing in Argentina, determine their geographical distribution, and assess the potential impact of an invasive species, specifically the Asian Lady Beetle (Harmonia axyridis) and eventually of any other exotic species on native ones  Specific goals:  Monitor the spread of the Asian Lady Beetle across Argentina  Assess the degree of spatial coexistence of said invasive species with other conspicuous native species (i.e., obvious to the eye) of the same family, in order to identify the most threatened species  

Description of citizen participation: Citizens send photos indicating the date and the geographic location where said insects have been observed

Time frame: 7/12/2019 - NA

Project leaders: Victoria Werenkraut, CONICET Researcher. National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET, in Spanish).
