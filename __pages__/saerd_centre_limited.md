Saerd Centre are a company who specialize in a multi-dimensional approach to flood control in Kampala city. The organization was founded in 2017 with a focus of developing innovative appropriate solutions and offer practical training, their belief is that innovation is a vital part of development of new industries and the industrial transformation to create a smarter society in Africa.   Flash floods affect many parts of Kampala city causing heavy rainfall, poorly maintained drainage systems, waste disposal in drainage channels, silting in natural channels and improper house planning of city suburbs contribute to the flooding. In 2020 alone Kampala experienced over 4 deadly flash floods which have left more than two dead and caused not only city-wide disruptions on travel and businesses but also destruction of properties and wide spread of water-borne diseases.   Saerd’s main goal is to develop multi-dimensional structural and non-structural approach to control occasional floods and simultaneously mitigate future flood occurrences, currently the existing flood control measures include desilting of the channels to curb the floods regular maintenance of drainages but are inadequate. Saerd’s solution entails the structural measures which include water harvesting & multi-storage (i.e., underground reservoirs, drainage pumps). While there is a possibility of channeling this water to Lake Victoria, it can serve water needs in other sectors such as urban agriculture and industries. Moreover, underground water storage systems are one of the most sustainable approaches that has worked in other countries, for example, the one of Tokyo called the floodwater cathedral hidden 22 meters underground. The integration of the public-private partnership (PPP Model) into Saerd’s solution to drive capacity and sustainability is vital for providing much-needed support for monitoring, management and facility use.   The following can be expected at the end of the project: 1.      A feasibility study plan for flood control and storm water management of the Kampala city. 2.     A Master plan on comprehensive flood and storm water management entailing structural and non-structural measures. 3.     Designed and constructed multi storage, underground tanks/reservoirs, drainage pumps and Water harvesting system. 4.     Addition of new opportunities in the job market. 5.     Development of a new flood forecasting and warning system.
