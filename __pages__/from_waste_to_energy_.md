## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

From waste to energy.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge for this Big Bet is to be able to provide a second life to plastic waste.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As described in our previous action plans, solid waste management remains our Big Bet. For this cycle, we would like to capitalize on the learnings we acquired through the sensemaking process with solid waste recyclers and experiment one (or more) waste transformation solutions.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to the final report of the tokten project (UNDP-Mali) and the solid waste management master plan in Bamako 2020 et perspective 2021, the statistics are as follows:   - 2,240 m3 of waste are produced per day in Bamako (Rapport Tokten-PNUD Mali); - 0,84kg are produced per person / day (solid waste management master plan in Bamako 2020 et perspective 2021) - 2% of the Daily production of waste consists of plastic (Rapport Tokten-PNUD); - 3.6% per year is the population growth rate (RGPH 2009 INSTAT)   NB: the data are theoretical and require an update according to the National Direction of Sanitation of the Control of Pollution and Nuisance

The challenge is now a priority for the transition in Mali, particularly the Ministry of the Environment, Sanitation and Sustainable Development. The same is true for the PTFs. The state has identified a final landfill which is at the center of controversy between players in the sector, which finds it too remote and underdeveloped.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Lab helps build a portfolio of innovative solutions applicable to different nodes of the problem in order to increase the systemic impact. Several players intervened a long time ago on this challenge but the gap remains significant. So, the application of the Lab's protocol will make it possible to propose solutions to the country office and partners in order to overcome this challenge. Also, the lab through the innovative solution of transforming plastic waste into fuel and gas could facilitate access to energy sources and reduce the pressure on vegetation.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In order to alleviate energy poverty, the Accelerator Lab in Mali is experimenting a local solution that transforms plastic waste to energy. With satisfactory test results, this home-made solution could be scaled to provide energy to many homes in urban and rural Mali.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Below are our three learning questions for this challenge:   1.          If plastic waste is transformed into fuel and gas then it will have value and disappear from nature;   2.         If plastic waste is turned into gas then it will help reduce the pressure on natural resources;   3.         If plastic waste is transformed into fuel and gas then it will facilitate the access of households to energy sources.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The waste to energy local innovation that we will like to test is a prototype that needs to develop into a proof of concept. Using system thinking, we plan to connect this recycler with other actors of the system such as waste producers and collectors.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We would like to be able to use connected objects to collect new data on the amount of waste transformed and make it open. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We would like to connect this innovator with local partner incubators so that the prototype could be further developed.
