## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The acknowledgement of development as a complex or wicked issue is more now than ever. For development practitioners, a regular working day is part implementing activities which you know are most likely to work, and part adapting to changing circumstances and learning what else would work.   While there is significant momentum on planning and design for the former where we decisively sift and contextualize solutions, there is little emphasis on iteration and reflection which help us learn. In fact, we find course correction nested in implementation in the form of midterm reviews and end of the year evaluations.   To understand how implementation would look different if it is continually evolving in the short term in line with longer term development goals.   Over the last year, the Accelerator Lab with the Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific Project (Gov4Res), integrated reflection sessions to learn rapidly about their interventions. We built off one of the core elements of the Accelerator Lab: working out loud which involves reflecting, thinking, and trying to make sense of something and then sharing it with the larger community. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If working out loud and reflection were to be integrated in project's way of working, then there would be greater agility and iteration and focus on learning

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

As structured reflection and communications are two sides of the ‘working out loud’ coin, we experimented with both. Gov4Res has been successful with programming in uncertainty and working with an agile approach. As the team expanded and the work scaled, they were keen to find an institutionalized method for rapid iterative design. For their newly launched Small Grants Initiative, we co-designed and ran 4 structured reflection sessions over 6 months. The sessions were supported by the Gov4Res MEL and programming specialist to ensure that learning was integrated in the programmatic cycle. We selected Kolb’s experiential learning cycle as a methodology which could enable reflection and create ways to action new knowledge.   On the communications front, we ran a social media training session facilitated by the Gov4Res partnerships and communications specialist, to enable the team to share their ongoing work with their stakeholders and the larger development community. At the end of the training, the team set two clear objectives to ensure they experiment with various media, find what works best for them and discover their own social media voice:  Put out 1 original/your own social media post on any topics per week    React to 2 social media posts from UNDP and/or partners on the Gov4Res-related topics per week (and use the Gov4Res project key hashtags/handles) 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Change in the way of working - new practices / formats etc.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Learning was documented on mural and social media analysis was done to see impact / reach of project

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

partially proven. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We needed to test new way of learning rather than stick with one framework

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

0

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The project has integrated reflection in their way of working 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

NA

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report. 

NA
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

As a team launching a new initiative, the reflection sessions pulled the team away from the rigamarole of implementation to identify trends and patterns for future iteration. It created the necessary time and space for the team to mentally process their work and internalize the lessons so that they can be transferred and applied.   The sessions resulted in project-based learning which helped improve efficiency and stay on track. For example, the team decided to create live manuals (over static documents) which continue to evolve with every new iteration. As this programme was implemented during COVID-19 and several natural hazards, this flexibility and agility ensured that they stayed demand driven and adapted to the local government’s needs and aligned with other technical support.   The reflection also supported problem-based learning. It drew on the team’s collective experience to reflect on their theory of change, their project journey over the last 7 years, seeing the range of their interventions through new lens and leading to new opportunities to address the problem. For the Small Grants, it compelled the team to appreciate the distinct needs of different countries and follow a country-specific approach for its next iteration.   Post the social media training, the total number of people reached via social media posts was over 54,000 after boosting communications efforts. This spike was considerable compared to 24,000 which was the number of people reached throughout the entire last year. Social media became an additional outreach mechanism and created space for two-sided communication with stakeholders, particularly communities to whom the Small Grants Initiative was designed to serve.  

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The sessions would have benefited from the participation of other stakeholders whose contributions would have made for a richer discussion. Currently, the team is building on this process and creating similar learning spaces with development partners and grantees of the Small Grants Initiative. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All projects as agility is the need of the hour

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

All Governance projects

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, we tried another framework for one the sessions with a small group and that worked better.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Get the team to facilitate one of the sessions

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

YES

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Not very much. 

> What surprised you?

Resistance to engaging on working out loud. There were concerns on privacy and no clear incentive to change the way of working
