## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Youth and Peace: The Psychosocial, Art and Sport Models for Peace (PASMP) 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is a high level of youth crime and delinquency in Trinidad and Tobago despite the presence of many youth and community groups using innovative means to promote peace; there is a disconnect between the positive work and large-scale positive outcomes.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

With the removal of COVID-19 restrictions on the movement of persons, the incidence of crime has been increasing in Trinidad and Tobago. During the pandemic, reported crimes of all types declined from 960 in January 2020, to figures steadily below 600; since then, rates of reported crime have steadily increased and are currently within a range of 800-960, per month from January to October 2022. Building peaceful societies and sustaining citizen security requires a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder approach which is driven by the ideology that both social and law-enforcement approaches must be integrated into justice systems transformation.  Youth must necessarily be placed at the centre of any attempts to enhance systems of peace and justice. Our intervention seeks to increase the resilience of vulnerable youth and break the cycle of criminality that has become the norm. On this basis, the Accelerator Lab will design an approach to encourage youth and women's groups to come up with innovative ideas to promote peace within their communities. 

RE: Official quantitative data sources below: Crime Totals By Month (ttps.gov.tt) and the Children's Court. 

As at October 2022, an average of 443 criminal matters have been filed against children annually from (2018-2022). From February 2018 to May 31, this year a total of 1,771 criminal matters have been filed in the Children Court between the ages of seven and under 18. The five most common offences were possession of ammunition, possession of a firearm, robbery with aggravation, shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and larceny.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab noted that while peacebuilding work was taking place in Trinidad and Tobago such work was mainly being conducted by individuals, and youth groups and women's groups separately. The Lab saw a space where youth and women's groups could be encouraged and trained to co-design and co-implement peacebuilding projects based on the needs within their own communities. As such the peace innovation challenge was conceptualized to 1) encourage women's and youth groups to collaborate on peacebuilding projects and 2) to build the capacity of women's and youth organizations to integrate peacebuilding methodologies into their work and effectively execute peacebuilding projects at the community level. 

Past evidence shows that art has been used to engage young people in expression that helps them address internal and external challenge and fosters peace. Likewise, sport has been shown to help young people develop self-control and channel aggression in ways that foster pro-social behaviour. Finally, past evidence from UNDP projects show the value of psychosocial interventions in supporting youth. The Accelerator Lab combined the forces of civil society working with youth in the areas of art therapy, sport interventions and a professional psychologist to foster peace in communities. UNDP Accelerator Lab worked with partner agencies to conceptualise the project, sought funding through the Department for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), was warded funding and deployed a project focused on the St. Jude's School for Girls, a residential school for girls in state custody for various reasons including conflict with the law.  The project is on-gong but has already generated several quick wins.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Funding was mobilised from the DPPA as a grant of USD50K, with the potential to increase to USD150K. This has been used to design the model, implement the project and attain visibility with the President of the Republic. Two NGOs are implementing the respective art and peace aspects of the project while a consultant, guided by the Accelerator Lab, is overseeing the project. The Lab is working with the country office PDA to ensure that training materials are provided to the staff of the institution so that the model not die with the closure of our intervention. All of the partners are new. the NGOs arose from the Peace Innovation Challenge; the DPPA is a completely new relationship; and the Country Office PDA has advised on projects before but never worked so closely with UNDP on project design, implementation and oversight.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Are peacebuilding projects more impactful and sustainable when women's groups and youth groups collaborate?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through the utilization of collaborative approaches with small projects proven successful, the Accelerator Lab has been able to identify, select and refine the strongest and most innovative solutions from the grassroots in the peacebuilding space. The biggest learning from this activity is the impact of the projects for the beneficiaries, in evidence by their own testimonials and reports from staff of the state institution and the consultant reports. Another learning lesson relates to the value of direct invitation to persons of influence to be part of the project. In this case, a direct invitation was made to Her Excellency, President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and Speaker of the House, both of whom have responded favourably to participating in the project AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. The interest expressed by the Office of the Prime Minister for scale up to other residential homes for youth has also been phenomenal.   

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

During our time working in this space, there has been anecdotal evidence of art and sport programmes making a real difference to young men and women in residential homes. However, the strategic combination of both with psychosocial support is unique. Moreover, the programmes that have been implemented to date have not been rigorous with capturing lessons learnt and changes in beneficiaries. Our work has been at a very small scale and has focused on 25 young women between the ages of 14 and 19. However, a significant difference to our work is the capture of data in a structured and rigorous way. Psychosocial assessments were conducted on the participants to gather "before and after data". The intervention started late, largely because of the difficulties NGOs had registering with Quantum. Our work will end in February 2023 and has already generated unique data on the intervention for our local context. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Government at the very highest level has already expressed interest in scaling up the project to a programmatic level. The aftercare component is being codesigned by the Accelerator Lab, Country PDA, partner NGOs and the St. Jude's School. Further, the DPPA has expressed interest in scaling the project if they can mobilise funds in time to match the government's own funding cycle. Other interested parties are the Ministry of National Security and the Ministry of Community Development and Family Services
