> Title of the innovation

Litter Eliminators and recycling

> Brief description of the innovation

We intend to produce the product by firstly offering the community knowledge on how 
to dispose waste by separating non-biodegradable waste making it easy to recycle and 
making the biodegradable waste into manure and use for agriculture.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target customers are households, traders, restaurant owners and bars.we intend to collect fees from them to generate income to pay people helping us,other operations such as transportation of garbage from the sources,sorting and decomposition of biodegradable waste and taking non biodegradable waste to recycling companies. We need the prize to help us execute our business. The environment will be free from harsh burnings, dumping and blockages of drainages from garbage.The compost will be used in agriculture and help combat food security because it will be very affordable.

> Technical Feasibility

Our business will be collecting garbage from households, markets, bars and restaurants 
at a fee and will later recycle biodegradable waste to manure and non-biodegradable 
waste taken to recycling companies.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Copper belt produces over 2700 tonnes of waste every day and only half of it is taken to 
the dumpsite, this made us develop interest in waste management. There has been a rise 
in wrong disposal of waste in Communities in Zambia. People are mostly burning plastics, 
pilling them up on the streets, in the markets which is making the environment dirty which 
leads to diseases. In 2018 a lot of people died due to Cholera which was caused by poor 
garbage disposal which had blocked drainages that led to contaminated water which 
later caused waterborne diseases.
Copper belt has an estimation of 2675446 population, our business is going to solve the 
problem by recycling biodegradable waste into manure which will be sold to farmers 
and recycling non-biodegradable waste which will be taken to recycling companies.
