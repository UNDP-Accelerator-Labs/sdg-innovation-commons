The global pandemic has had an adverse impact on learning and equity; but it also provided an opportunity to rethink the way students are educated. To explore this, the UNDP Accelerator Lab joined hands with the Volunteers Association for Bangladesh (VAB) – a grassroots organization dedicated to rural education since 2000 - to pilot an innovative E-Learning project. It is assisting rural and disadvantaged high school students from 9 schools across five districts - the majority being girls - on their preparation for the upcoming 2021 national secondary school certificate (SSC) examination through e-learning via tablets and digital contents. However, it is yet to be tested how effective and impactful are online-learning models via tablets and digital contents for digitally underprivileged rural high-school students, especially girls, for the preparation of their SSC examination.  The Accelerator Lab is conducting a baseline survey to assess the current and the pre-pilot implementation status of digital underprivileged rural high school students from 5 districts in Bangladesh on relevant indicators, and an end line survey to assess the progress, results, and impact of the pilot (online-learning model via tablet and digital contents) intervention (including samples from non-tablet users) to deliver the necessary knowledge around impact of such models.
