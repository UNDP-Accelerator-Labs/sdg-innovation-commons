## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1- In Sudan economic collaboration is culturally ingrained in rural areas 2-  financing agricultural is one the most challenge faces small farmers  3- agricultural best practices is most needed  4- local agricultural techniques need to be documented and put into best practices  5- lack of government support for small farmers.  7- financial innovations need to be linked to small farmers (Sacco)

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
none published yet

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The political fluctuation and instability made nudging the system extremely challenging and hindered impact of the intervention

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Consumer behavior , commodity gap (informality), producers behavior, input acquisitions, and commodity prices 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The complexity and fragility of Sudan context, and the gap of credible data has made it crucial to to test these innovations. These innovations also addressed incertitude by tackling ambiguity and ignorance of the system
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Coop Network is an initiative to network CO-OPS to share experience and peer to  peer, Community capacity development, and GCP model development 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Trade, Food Security company  and Ministry of youth and Sports a collaboration to restructure and reignite the cooperative sector in Sudan by leveraging experimental models to influence policy making and advocating for integrated policy

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Coop network is a informal youth led civil society that has emerged during the covid19 crisis to rationalize general consumption 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The complex dynamic system of prevalent informality and the system structures have historical analog, so these approaches contributed to understanding system and taking steps into system transformation.  

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
