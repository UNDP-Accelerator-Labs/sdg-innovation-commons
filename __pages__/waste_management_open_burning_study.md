## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.While open burning of municipal and agricultural wastes is banned, illegal dumping and burning of garbage to avoid paying fees in Vientiane capital still continues at an increasing rate (Vientiane Mayor Order and hotline). 2. Although residential trash pickup service is available, open burning activities still occur at least once a week, this was confirmed in the participation workshop with villagers and the village authorities. 3. Villagers do not know how to make fertilizer or compose biomass waste. In the future, they hope to make the compost and use it for green agriculture that is good for the environment in the community. 4. Some villagers and village leaders would like to have a community waste bank which can be run by the school. This will encourage learning in the community and provide an incentive for students to practice if they get something in return.  5. 6 main reasons why people burn garbage.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

We experienced trust issue among the municipality not granting access to the target villages and approving our tools such as mobile app, photo taking and they asked to screen the questionnaire that we would use to ask the local villagers. Besides that Covid19 lockdown measures also delayed the process for ground work.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We would like to be able to capture the burning spots, locations in the community and how it could affect health and the community. Asides from sensor data and satellite imageries we use transect walk to capture the small burnings which could not be captured by the satellites. Lastly, we use micro surveys and community workshops/observations to understand why the villagers burn waste, how often and what types of waste they burn which link to economic factors, behaviors and waste management service.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Horizon scanning helps us to see this issue in the system and confirm the issue. Collective intelligence helps us to learn the issue from the views of many stakeholders involved and support with necessary data. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Disadvantage Children And Youth Development Association (DCYA). They supported to conduct community consultation workshops

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

National University of Laos. The national consultant is a GIS expert and professor from the university who helped us with satellite images and sensor data and the final analysis for the report.  

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Vientiane City Office for Management or Services (VCOMS). We aimed to work with them to tackle down the issue but did not receive a good cooperation. They just participated in the final dissemination and consultation workshop.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All of them are new to UNDP Laos

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable at this stage. Other UN agencies such as UNICEF, WHO and FAO expressed interests.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Sensor data and sattellite 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
