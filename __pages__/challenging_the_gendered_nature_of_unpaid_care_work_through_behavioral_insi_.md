## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Challenging the gendered nature of unpaid care work through Behavioral Insights Study
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

How do we change behaviour  among men and boys to increase their acceptance of and responsibility towards unpaid care work?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In India, women spend an average of 351.9 minutes per day on unpaid care work, whereas men spend an average of 51.8 minutes per day.  During the pandemic and especially during the lockdown stage, this imbalance is exacerbated.  In this context, the behavioral insights pilot aims to shift online behaviors of boys and men in select areas of Karnataka, making them more aware and supportive of unpaid caregiving during the pandemic. Data will be collected both from stakeholder consultations and a digital “nudge” pilot.

One in three women will experience intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. There is already an uptick in these cases, with the National Commission for Women (NCW) in India registering 587 cases between March 23 and April 16, up from 396 cases between February 27 and March 22, reports Al Jazeera.

Migration exodus, lack of income and restricted supplementary nutrition services from the ICDS cumulatively increase the stress of providing family food security on women. ” https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/a-gendered-view-of-the-covid-19-crisis/article31404869.ece# 6) “As cities around the world have gone into lockdown and quarantine mode, the reports of an alarming rise in domestic violence are mostly related to Coronavirus pandemic. The increased threat of gendered violence during public health emergencies becomes a nightmare for female victims. Amid the Coronavirus epidemic, women’s vulnerabilities across the world are aggravating the pre-existing gender-based susceptibilities.” https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-opinion-the-gendered-impact-of-coronavirus-pandemic-in-india/350804 7) https://scroll.in/article/957787/how-indias-lockdown-has-put-women-in-middle-class-homes-at-a-greater-disadvantage

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The India lab first touched upon this topic during the pandemic when they were fighting misinformation through gamification: Corona Champion Game. Stories from media, reports from UN Women all pointed towards the fact that Covid-19 has exacerbated the additional unpaid care burden on women: Children are out of school and at home, the elderly are at greater risk of infection and may require additional care than usual and both women and men are working from home as well. Given the prolonged nature of the pandemic, it is imperative to support equal participation in the labor force. Encouraging men and boys to increase their share of the unpaid care work can have a positive impact on the division of labor at the household level.  It is worth investing in this challenge since similar Behavioral Insights based studies are depicting similar patterns and also generating evidence on the success of these interventions. Our lab is learning from Lebanon and Jordan Lab  and exchanging early insights and lessons from each other's pilots.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our consultant and partner- Quilt AI are undertaking this research with and for us along with our Gender team from Regional Bureau of Asia pacific.  Main hypothesis: How do we change behaviour  among men and boys to increase their acceptance of and responsibility towards unpaid care work? Specifically looking at the online search behavior in 2 districts of an ongoing project of UNDP India’s inclusive growth team (focusing on career guidance and employment opportunities).  Objectives: ● To shift online behavior among boys and men in select districts of Karnataka on perspectives linked to women and work, with an emphasis on the value of unpaid caregiving ● To link the online behavior shift directly to Project Unnati, which aims to improve access to career guidance, employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for both young people and women ● To run a digital “nudge pilot” and understand how to scale the online behavior shifts (Platform: Facebook) Target group and content: ● The target is Boys (age 13-17) and Men (age 18-35) and the goal is to move them towards the attitudinal/behavioral change so that they recognise unpaid caregiving in the home and increase their individual participation on a daily basis in select areas of Karnataka ● The virtual nudge pilot will reach 50,000 users across two districts (through Facebook platform)

In order to understand how men and boys consume digital material actively and passively on women and work (with a focus on unpaid caregiving) across social media platforms and in search behavior, the first step undertaken was to look at the content topic universe of men and boys in Karnataka in general (broken down by age and location)  - which platforms they frequent and what type of content engages them. Next step was to look at how men and boys engage with content across social media platforms and in search behavior , specific to unpaid caregiving during the pandemic. Using the digital ecosystem analysis, three distinct phases/personas were identified where boys, single men, married men and fathers lie: i) Traditional: Guided by traditional values and beliefs; Entrenched mindsets dictates social norms; Unreceptive to change and correction. ii) Transitional: See a need for change, but unwillingly / uncomfortable with detering too much from norm; Receptive to more information. iii) Progressive: At the forefront of change; Seek to educate and empower others. Accordingly targeted messaging was designed using the Facebook platform with 3 types of content:  • Informational snippet- 90% of Indians online believe that men and women should always share household chores.  The times have changed, Have you? • Entertainment (e.g. role models in memes) • Inspirational linked to Commitments and actions – commitment to share the load

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are still awaiting the full results of the pilot. The question that we face right now: How effective will the behavioral science research and “nudge” approach be in changing behaviors? 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are trying to learn: Can using BI in the digital space led to lasting behavior change, how to monitor this over time; what to supplement or complement this method with ? how can this help us in future development programming? A key insight going forward is the notion that engaging men and boys in positive action around gender can go a long way in designing future skilling programmes. For instance, skilling programs of UNDP to have this component in-built (behavioral change messaging) since many a times we see drop out rates of girls once the career guidance counselling program is over. The reason being, skilling programs in vacuum can only take women so far as they often go back to environments where action and power is likely to be in a male dominated environment. The environment they go back to, is a representation of the complexity of the system or the social infrastructure of life that women and men operate in. Infact the gendered nature of care work predominantly exists because of prevalent patriarchal norms and traditional concepts around gendered roles in communities. In this case, the ongoing digital nudge pilot then has the potential to attempt to answer (not alone but in conjunction with other methods): So how do we approach the environment in totality so that any skilling programmes dont just upskill women but also give them the best possible chance to succeed outside the vacuum of skilling programmes?
