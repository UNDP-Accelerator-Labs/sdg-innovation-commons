Designing the UNDP Local Governance Portfolio in Bosnia and Herzegovina with systemic insights and multi-stakeholder engagement
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to transform the local self-government system in Bosnia and Herzegovina into a sustainable, efficient, transparent, innovative, capable, and responsible framework that meets the evolving needs of all citizens. Currently, the system faces issues of underdeveloped functions and capacities, insufficient involvement in higher-level policy-making, and uneven availability and quality of local services. The need for systemic shifts is imperative to enable local self-governments to play a pivotal role in the accelerated sustainable development of communities, ensure inclusive citizen engagement, and foster strong partnerships across all governance actors. This transformation requires a strategic and innovative approach to policymaking and service delivery, enhancing resilience to socio-economic challenges and ensuring that public services are accessible, equitable, and responsive to the diverse needs of the population.

Accelerator Lab will support the Portfolio team by facilitating external knowledge networking and sensemaking, convening for complex agenda, connecting stakeholders across sectors and mandates, creating the space, agency and tools to reconcile conflicting development interests, help a “whole-of-government” and “whole-of-society” conversation for system-level discussion and prioritisation and leverage information and data to generate knowledge, visualize and translate complex concepts into synthesized information and analysis that inform the portfolio design and motivates engagement of stakeholders.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The history of our challenge stems from a complex interplay of socio-political (strong divisions across the country, post-conflict society) and economic factors (transition from socialist planned economy to liberal capitalism) that have shaped the current state of local self-government in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The country has undergone significant political and administrative reforms in the post-conflict restructuring period. These reforms were essential for peace and reconstruction but have led to a fragmented governance structure with overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities, contributing to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in local governance. 

The challenge is driven by complex legislative and institutional frameworks that have not kept pace with the evolving needs of communities, with depopulation (especially of professionals) affecting most of the county (except main cities). Local self-governance has limited involvement in policy-making and implementation over broader development strategies. Inequitable budget allocation to undeveloped and underdeveloped local communities has led to disparities in the availability and quality of local services, particularly affecting rural areas. Local self-governments often lack the necessary capacities, both in terms of human skills and financial and technical resources, to effectively address the needs of their communities and drive sustainable development.

The challenge involves a wide range of actors, including local self-government units (represented by both elected officials and civil servants), higher levels of government in the country (entity, cantonal, and national), civil society organizations, international organizations and partners, and local community representatives.

The current situation is characterized by a lack of coordination and coherence across levels of government, limited citizen engagement in local governance processes, and disparities in service delivery. This negatively affects the quality of life, socio-economic perspectives of the local communities, disparities in service availability or quality, leaving vulnerable populations further marginalized, and the level of trust in the efficiency and responsiveness of local self-governments to local communities' needs.

European Commission's Reports on Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2019 onward, emphises concerns on the capacity and efficiency of local governments highliting that fragmented administrative structures and limited administrative capacities at the local level impede effective service delivery, coordination and development planning. The positive development in the latest report is adoption of Strategy on Local Self-Governance in one of the entities, but still needs to be implemented. The Balkan Barometer 2023, an annual survey conducted by the Regional Cooperation Council, shows a persistent low level of public trust in government institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with only around 21% of respondents expressing trust (or tend to trust) in local municipalities. This low level of trust is indicative of the perceived lack of responsiveness and effectiveness of local governance. The latest World Bank Systemic Country Diagnostic Update reveals that the quality of basic public services is poor, especially at the local level. "Citizen satisfaction with public services—many of which state-owned enterprises provide—is the lowest in the region." Spending on social assistance is very high in the country (2.9 percent of GDP allocated to social assistance, but the decentralized structure, poorly coordinated, generates extensive administrative and regulatory inefficiencies and significant inequalities between local communities. Extensive UNDP field work discovered and noted challenges in ensuring equitable access to quality public services in local communities. Main challenges include inadequate infrastructure, limited financial resources, and disparities in service quality between urban and rural areas.

The slow pace of policy and legislative adaptation to the rapid socio-political and economic changes underscores the urgency for more decisive action to enhance governance adaptability and responsiveness. Environmental challenges (pollution, flooding), social issues (migration and demographic changes), economic issues (high inflation rate) all signal the pressing need for local government to be more sustainable and resilient, by adopting strategic and systemic approaches to local planning and development. More and more citizens call for more efficient, accessible, and quality public services, while stakeholders' engagement reveiled the need for digital transformation, as well as lack of systemic adoption of such innovations. Association of cities and municipalities and entities constantly stress the need to enhance fiscal autonomy and develop smarter resource allocation strategies that would support underdeveloped local communities. Analysis of annual Balkan Barometer reports shows increase of public skepticism towards local authorities. Local government officials stress the difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled professionals both from the demographic changes perspective and due to perceived nepotism and lack of meritocracy, which signals the urgency for human resource reforms in local government that prioritize competence and professional development. Implementation of multi-annual "Strengthening the Role of Local Communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina" project indicates a growing desire among citizens to play a more active role in local governance processes.

Accelerator Lab supports the work of Local Governance stakeholders' engagement platform, with representatives from government (state, entity, and local level), civil society, citizens representatives, international organizations and donors, and academia, which drives a portfolio design process through co-creation, leveraging collective intelligence, and utilizing sensemaking to interpret complex stakeholder feedback, enabling us to identify patterns, trends, and underlying issues that inform strategic decision-making and prioritization within the portfolio. Applying system thinking helps look at local governance as an interconnected whole, allowing for the identification of leverage points and interdependencies that can be targeted for impactful, systemic change through the portfolio’s interventions.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Baseline surveys provide crucial initial insights, setting a foundation from which we can tailor portfolio interventions to bridge specific knowledge gaps, ensuring a data-driven and precisely targeted approach to engaging stakeholders. Workshops, both digital and on-site, serve as our primary tools for fostering direct dialogue and co-creation among various levels of government, communities, civil society, and academia. Through issue mapping, we gain a clearer understanding of the interconnected challenges facing the local governance system. The culmination of interviews, discussions, online surveys, and other methodologies yields qualitative data that is instrumental in informing our portfolio's sensemaking and design process, making it more coherent and impactful.
