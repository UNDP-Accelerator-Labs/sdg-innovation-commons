In a dry arid country where drought and desertification are no longer a threat but a reality,  a single car wash is exceeds 70 liters of drinkable water in professional car washing services and more than 300 liters for traditional washing which is the way most of the Moroccan clean their cars.   a car wash service at home and without water.  A water-less way to clean cars in Morocco could not be more helpful in saving the perhaps future most scarce resource.
