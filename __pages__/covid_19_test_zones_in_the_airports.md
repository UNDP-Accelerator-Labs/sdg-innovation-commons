Passengers who arrived to Ukraine from countries in the "red list", can take PCR test near the arrival zone in order to avoid being quarantined for 14 days. Once the test is out confirming negative status (24-48h), the state deactivates the quarantine requirement for newly arrived passengers in the Diy Vdoma app.
