> Description of the solution

Idroplan is a comprehensive tool for managing both irrigation and vine diseases. By estimating water stress and predicting water consumption, it helps optimize irrigation practices. Additionally, Idroplan calculates and forecasts risk indices for common vine pathogens, enabling proactive disease management. To leverage the power of localized weather data, Idroplan integrates with Sencrop, allowing users to connect their weather stations and gain valuable insights for improved crop health and yield.
