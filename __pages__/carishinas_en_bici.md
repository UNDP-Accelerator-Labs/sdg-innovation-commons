## 

"Carishinas" is a Quichua word, which in Spanish has become popular to describe women and girls who don´t fit into traditional roles. Women who don´t cook well, who like to play outdoors and do "male" activities are disdainly called "carishinas". Honoring this term, a group of women have organized the collective "Carishinas on Bicycles". This citizen organization aims to reclaim public spaces for women who can freely transport themselves on bicycles. Ecuador is not Amsterdam, so access to a male, car dominated public space is quite a challenge.
Because of traditional roles, many adult women do not know how to ride bikes. This women´s collective teaches women to ride bikes, and hit the road! Group biking are organized.
This experience was storytold in Human Library event organized by Ecuador AccLab in January.
