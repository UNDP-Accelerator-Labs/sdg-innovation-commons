As part of the Lab Open Day, this project was presented by the young innovator Érico Pinheiro from PrimeBotics. It is an initiative and/or technological solution to support the fight against the spread of COVID-19 (street disinfestation) as well as to combat the socioeconomic crisis (linked to agriculture) caused by the Pandemic crisis. The purpose of the project is to develop a multi-purpose Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is capable of dispersing seeds in agriculture fields with potential for reforestation, spray pesticides, fertilizers, and disinfectants, as well package delivery to remote populations (vaccine, medical samples, school materials).
