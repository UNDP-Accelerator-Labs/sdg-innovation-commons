> Type of the Solution

Urban planning

> Affected Sector

Transport

> Description of the solution

Paris is turning the city into myriad neighborhoods where residents can find everything they need within a comfortable 15-minute walk or cycle from home. The city plans to install a cycle path on every street and bridge, increase office space and co-working hubs in neighborhoods that lack them, expand the uses of infrastructure and buildings outside standard hours, encourage people to use their local shops, and create small parks in school playgrounds that would be open to local people outside of school hours to combat the city‚Äôs lack of public green space.

> Socio-economic effects

Increased accessibility to services, local economic development, health benefits from both active modes of transport (walking, biking, etc.) and improved air quality.
