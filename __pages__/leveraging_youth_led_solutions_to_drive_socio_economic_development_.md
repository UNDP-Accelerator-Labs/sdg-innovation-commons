## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Leveraging youth-led solutions to drive socio-economic development. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge to is to develop models that democratise support that youth-led innovators receive to scale their solutions, irrespective of their gender, locality and educational level.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



It is predicted that Africa’s youth population will account for 42% of the global youth population by 2030 and could double from present levels by 20552.  It has also been predicted that by 2050, there will be 2.5 billion Africans, about a quarter of the global population3. This demographic dividend is also apparent in Nigeria. Currently, Nigeria’s youth constitute around 60% of its population. However increases in Nigeria’s youth population is not positively correlated with the creation of employment opportunities for the youth. Youth unemployment rate currently stands at 37%. 

Nigeria’s youth population represents untapped human capital. Its youth population, across regions, genders, rural and urban environments, literate and illiterate, all possess unique insights and potential solutions to the societal challenges of the country. Unique insights that are held by persons with experiences living in and exposed to unique cultural, economic and social contexts. And potential solutions that can spur the country’s social and economic development whilst producing employment opportunities.  

This situation demands the development of structures that support youth-based innovation, whilst also democratising the identification, incubation and scaling of youth-based innovation. Structures that ensure ‘no one is left behind’ in the creation and inception of solutions. In turn building the capacity of Africa’s youth to develop innovative solutions facilitating socio-economic development and creating meaningful employment opportunities.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab is utilising validated solution mapping methodologies  that have been tested within the global accelerator lab network to create frameworks to uncover solutions across 13 thematic areas  in Nigeria. Additionally, the lab it is utilising its diverse network of innovation ecosystem actors, such as innovation hubs, academia and State governments to fulfil the programme objectives. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



The Accelerator Lab in Nigeria is working with Mastercard Foundation to identify and scale 5000 youth-led solutions to drive socio-economic development across a range of sectors.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What scalable models can be created to test and scale youth-led solutions from persons within traditionally marginalised backgrounds?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



HCD is essential to ensure this programme produces new methods to support innovators 'where they are' opposed to implicitly encouraging innovators to become 'typical main-streamed innovators' and in turn doubling down on biases and inequalities. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Direct interviews with young innovators will permit engagement and support of these persons to be contextualised.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The Young Africa Innovates Programme is a pilot -  lessons learnt and insights will be shared with other regional ecosystems across the 36 States in Nigeria - further to this, it will provide insights on how to support youth-led solutions by innovators from traditionally marginalised backgrounds. As part of the growth phase, similar programmes are being discussed across West African francophone countries with Mastercard Foundation, additionally it is hoped that such initiatives of youth-led solutions, particularly frugal innovation can be mainstreamed and executed independently by local ecosystems.
