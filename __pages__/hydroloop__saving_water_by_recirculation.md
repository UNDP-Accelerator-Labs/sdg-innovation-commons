The Hydro Loop is a hot water recirculation device designed to save water that is normally wasted waiting for hot water to arrive in the shower.

Instead of disposing of it, redirect the water back to the heater. With minimal investment, this device provides instant hot water at the push of a button, without wasting time. Now you can enjoy hot water immediately, keeping the same time you used to spend waiting. Unlike expensive home recirculation systems, which can be expensive in new construction and require large pumps that run constantly, the Hydro Loop minimizes electricity and gas costs. This makes having hot water available more accessible.
