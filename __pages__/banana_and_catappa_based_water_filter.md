My Filtro Aqua Natsponge is a filter that is used to filter wastewater, which can be used at home and even in restaurants. The innovation came about as the innovator Noor Liza often came across issues of waste being clogged up in pipe holes which consequently resulted in water and air pollution. The solution is inspired from Malay traditional knowledge, whereby in villages the Malays would soak their cutleries in a basin filled with water and banana leaves. This is done because the banana leaves can absorb grease and oil from the cutleries, which would then make it easier for the cleaning process to take place. Similarly, the innovation uses banana fibers from its stem to create a sponge that would be part of the first layer in the wastewater filtration system. With improvements being made to the design and function of the wastewater filter along the way, Catappa leaves are added to the mix. The upgraded version not only filters clean and clear water as a by product, it also prevents clogs and bacteria build-up after wastewater has been filtered. What also gives the My Filtro Aqua Natsponge an edge over others is that it is relatively cheaper and it does not use synthetic sponges that are harmful to the environment. On top of that, the filter can even be connected through a smartphone app to give an indication of the pH level of the filtered water. This will indicate when consumers should replace the first layer of the wastewater filter.
