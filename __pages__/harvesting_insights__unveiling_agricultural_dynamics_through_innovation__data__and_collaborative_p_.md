## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Direct engagement with the community is foundational. It's not just about providing a solution; it's about understanding the community's needs and involving them in the process. Aligning stakeholders (ICAT, farmers, weather agency) into a cohesive system enhances the agrometeorological process.

Unforeseen internal challenges and delays are inevitable. Being flexible in our approach and adapting to unexpected obstacles is crucial for the success of the initiative.

Applying diverse innovation methods, leveraging new data types, and engaging unusual partners generated unique insights unattainable by traditional means.

Real-life machine learning dynamics emerged; potential for AI/ML to automate data flow and enhance advisory systems.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Our work has gained the buy-in of the environment unit in our country office and has been integrated in their annual workplan so we can further pursue the development of the digital solution. 
## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We opted for real-time sensor data to provide accurate and timely agrometeorological insights. This choice aimed to fill gaps in traditional data sources, offering more granular and current information for better decision-making in agriculture.

Direct interviews and focus groups were chosen to complement quantitative data, providing qualitative context and bridging potential gaps in understanding user needs and preferences.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective Intelligence allowed us to tap into the diverse perspectives of stakeholders, aggregating insights crucial for understanding the complex agrometeorological system.

Human-Centered Design ensured that our solution addressed real user needs, fostering better engagement and usability. This approach helped unpack the system by placing the end-users at the core of the solution development process.

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay of innovative methods, new data sources, and unconventional partnerships facilitated a holistic understanding of the agricultural landscape.

Co-creation with farmers through participatory design and citizen science unveiled nuanced insights, while diverse data types enriched our perspective.

Collaboration with ICAT and other partners brought domain expertise, uncovering context-specific challenges.

This synergy allowed us to unearth deeper insights, fostering a more comprehensive and contextually relevant approach that traditional methods alone couldn't achieve.
