## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Economic Recovery: Informality + Financial Inclusion
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our main challenge is to identify new ways to accelerate economic recovery with two emphases: informal systems and financial inclusion. We are looking to leverage and harness the innovation available in informal systems and enabling inclusive financial mechanisms for the population in left-behind territories.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the health and socio-economic aspects a global scale. In Colombia, the most vulnerable groups (migrants, women, youth, and indigenous communities) were very affected, for example,  in 2020 Colombia’s employed population’s income decreases by 25 percent, the country’s monetary poverty will increase from 27 to 37 percent.  In this scenario, extreme monetary poverty would also increase from 7.2 to 10.7 percent and the Gini coefficient could increase between 1.5 and 2.5 percent in 2020.  There is a perception around public interventions available which required months to be deployed and remain distant for the people on their cordiality.  Within this context, informal systems, which are frequently presented as obstacles in development practice,  are the resilient layer and (re)invent themselves faster than formal systems.

According with household survey, In 2018, 60% of firms, 38% of workers and 33% of production were in informality.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The AccLab is looking to accelerate development from an integrated perspective in which interventions are created or activated to include vulnerable populations and left-behind territories in the economic recovery process, in particular, bringing to the table complementary perspectives from the grassroots but also experiences from around the world thanks to the global learning network.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The AccLab is exploring alternatives to deploy comprehensive and integrated interventions in order to accelerate post-Covid economic recovery of vulnerable population in left-behind territories.

UNDP and USAID had recently launched a relevant project to accelerate economic recovery in Colombian territories. The AccLab was determinant to bring the attention of the donors. The project incorporates at least three objectives: Increase national, regional and local governments´ capabilities for designing and implementing response and recovery policies //  Increase employability in targeted areas through labor certification and training //    Increase MSMEs productivity by strengthening business and management capabilities through more efficient and effective use of resources.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the signals from the informal systems we are underestimating? How can we accelerate financial inclusion in informal systems?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

> Behavioral insights: We are looking to identify the constraints and motivations to remain in informal systems. > Reverse engineering: We want to learn from previous (private and public) interventions to facilitate formalization. > Design Thinking & MVP: We are looking to generate a one-stop-shop alternative to generate learnings about the formal/informal spectrum.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

>> User Journeys are looking to clarify the different scenarios currently available (step by step) to facilitate/foster formalization. >>Socioeconomic data to identify tendencies, outliers and to prioritize opportunities for interventions.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

In terms of UNDP programmatic interventions, the experiments can contribute to updating the current portfolio of interventions which are promoting formalizations, directly or indirectly. In terms of public policy, the learning can influence regulatory or policy changes to facilitate the formalization process for MSME. In terms of private sector involvement, the process can help to identify patterns in inclusive business models which are facilitating formal behaviors/practices.
