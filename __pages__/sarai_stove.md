Profile Innovators Mr. R. M. Salunkhe and Dr. K. Dutta are from Pune district of Maharashtra. They are working with an NGO working for rural development through the implementation of innovative technologies in the field of non-conventional energy sources and agriculture. Purpose Mr. Salunkhe and Dr. Dutta have developed an innovative stove for fuel-saving, time-saving, and to improve the indoor air quality of the rural kitchen. Technical details The 'Sarai Stove' consists of four parts. All parts are made of mild steel. Combustion chamber: It is an open-ended cylinder, with an aluminum lining from inside. There is a door on the inside, and a series of holes along the periphery at the bottom. The holes serve as air inlets. There are two clamps on the side near the top for holding the outer jacket. Fuel holder This is a mild steel cylinder with an open top and a cast iron grate at the bottom. Solid fuel in the form of wood chips, coal, charcoal, biomass briquettes, etc. are placed in the holder, which in turn is placed inside the combustion chamber through its side door. Outer jacket It is an open-ended cylinder that fits on the top of the combustion chamber. There are two rows of holes circumscribing the cylinder near the top. Cooker with lid The cooker is a cylindrical vessel that can be inserted into the outer jacket, leaving an annular space of just about 2.5-3 mm between the walls of the two. It has a wide rim at the top, which seals up the annular space. The lid fits snugly into the open top of the cooker. To operate the stove, the fuel holder loaded with fuel is inserted into the combustion chamber. The outer jacket is fitted on to the chamber, and the cooker is inserted into it. About 200 ml of water is poured into the cooker and the cooking vessels are stacked in it, one on top of the other. The lid is closed and the fire is started. The air required for combustion of the fuel enters from the holes at the bottom of the combustion chamber and is sucked into the fuel stack through the grate at the bottom of the fuel holder. The hot gases and flames emitted by the fire pass through the annular space between the outer jacket and the cooker, and come out through the holes near the top of the outer jacket. The heat is conducted into the cooker through its bottom and walls and converts the water inside into the steam. The cooker fills up with steam and generates a sufficiently high temperature within the cooker to cook the food. Because of the fuel placed in the burner is limited, the stove extinguishes itself after a certain time. The food inside the vessel remains hot after the fire goes out due to the double jacket surrounding it. For frying or bread making, the outer jacket can be detached from the combustion chamber and the chamber can be used as a portable single pot stove. Performance The stove can be operated on any solid biomass fuel. Only 100 g of the charcoal is required to prepare food for 4-5 persons. The stove design is optimized for good combustion efficiency hence, cooking takes place in a smokeless environment. The outer jacket also can be used with a gas or kerosene stove, to increase fuel efficiency. Benefits The stove has higher fuel efficiency and it is smokeless. It increases the indoor air quality of the rural kitchen. Suggested Reading(s): YouTube, (2011). Sarai cooking stove, ARTI.
