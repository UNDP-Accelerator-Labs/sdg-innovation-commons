> Description of the solution

Construction is a major source of air pollution in cities. The Construction Emissions Tool is an open-source tool that helps construction companies to plan, monitor, and manage their polluting emissions. The tool enables the measurement of emissions from non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) throughout the demolition and construction phases of a project. Crucially, this also helps commissioners, such as local authorities or landowners, to review progress against agreed targets for a specific site. Hence, developers, contractors, local authorities, and auditors can all use this tool made available by the organization Impact on Urban Health.
