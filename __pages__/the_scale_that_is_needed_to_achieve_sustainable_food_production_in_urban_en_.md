## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The scale that is needed to achieve sustainable food production in urban environments can only be reached if existing public spaces with appropriate infrastructure are also used for food production and ecological training. When budget support is provided for the implementation of local grassroots solutions, state institutions can be more open to cooperating with UNDP. Local actors are more willing to collaborate, learn and support.  For the realization of the Agro-library, Governorate, District Governorate, Provincial Culture and Tourism Directorate and Banaz Municipality embraced the project after the experiment was completed.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.


> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

In the establishment process of the Agro library, we experienced disruptions especially in the supply of materials due to the geographical location and the inadequacy of the facilities. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Socioeconomic data to understand the geographic relations and target group. The age groups, gender and potential user profiles were discussed. Non-structured interviews were used to define the needs and desires. These interviews were held with both users and practitioners. Design thinking was necessary to design agro-library to imagine and plan the physical positions of garden, library, or seedbeds 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Co-creation and participatory design helped us to find a common ground with all the local actors, decisions were made with a participatory approach and co-creation was an important method especially during the implementation period to increase the adoption of the library.
