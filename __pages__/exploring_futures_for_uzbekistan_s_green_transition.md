## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Qualitative interviews and in-depth interviews gave us various expert perspective on the state and perspective of green transition in Uzbekistan – conducted see 

Collective intelligence session allowed to generate drivers of change and scenarios based on the horizon scanning exercises.

Socioeconomic data was used in an objective assessment and identification main trends and basic validation of subjective assessments

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Artificial Intelligence – Analyze gathered signals, identify patters, highlight trends, and create summaries – Used a platform called Newness

Collective Intelligence – validated and refined drivers of change, create stories around the drivers of change, draft scenarios – conducted through a series of workshops and sessions with UNDP staff and partner representatives

Foresight, Future Analysis – Futures and Foresight are used as the main framework tool used in this exercise

Horizon Scanning – to identify weak and strong signals about the futures – identified and analyzed more than 400 signals

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

An interesting feature has been the interplay of various data collection and collaboration tools: domain mapping, interviews, horizon scanning and the usage of the information for generation of the drivers of change, scenarios, and implications

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
