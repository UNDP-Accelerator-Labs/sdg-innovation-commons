> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Scaling and Standardizing Agro-Libraries in Türkiye 



## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



As the concept of Agro-Libraries becomes popular, there is a risk that its meaning and standards are misunderstood, leading to low-quality or superficial implementations. Our main challenge is to protect the quality and real impact of Agro-Libraries while scaling them.




> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Since 2022, we have worked with an innovation challenge finalist to establish Türkiye's first Agro-Library. Over the years, this idea has spread across the country. Many schools and institutions have contacted us and the innovators for support and information. Recently, the Ministry of National Education and UNESCO have shown interest, opening doors for national and international cooperation.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Currently, there is no official, centralized dataset on Agro-Libraries in Türkiye. However, the following points highlight the importance and urgency:

·       Since 2022, over 50 requests from schools and local institutions for Agro-Library support and guidance have been received.

·       Interest from the Ministry of National Education and UNESCO shows growing national and international relevance.

·       Türkiye has over 18,000 public libraries and 60,000 schools, showing high potential for scaling, but also the risk of uncoordinated, low-quality expansion without standard

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Through this action learning plan, we aim to develop accreditation standards, measurement tools, and a knowledge-sharing network for Agro-Libraries. Our final goal is to integrate Agro-Libraries into Türkiye's national education system with strong quality control and sustainable impact.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



We are working to scale Türkiye’s Agro-Libraries with clear standards, accreditation, and a knowledge-sharing network — ensuring quality, real impact, and opening the door for national and international cooperation. #AgroLibrary #Innovation #Education

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What is the best way to measure the real impact of Agro-Libraries?








How can we build a strong network for knowledge sharing between Agro-Libraries?








What steps are needed to bring this model into the national education system?








How can we ensure quality and sustainability while scaling?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Data Collection: We will collect data from existing Agro-Libraries to understand their impact and needs.




Collective Intelligence: We will bring partners and experts together to co-design standards and best practices




Scaling and Proof of Concept: We will test the model in different regions to prove its success before national expansion.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Currently, there is limited data on the real impact, quality, and operational conditions of Agro-Libraries across Türkiye. We lack standardized information on how they are implemented and used in different regions.




What value do these add:

New data collection will help us measure impact, identify good and weak practices, and understand local needs. This will directly support creating clear standards, improving quality, and designing a scalable, effective national model.
