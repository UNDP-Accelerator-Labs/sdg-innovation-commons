By improving agricultural sectors like fish farming,cattle farming,poultry, castial plantation and some demo plots will help (OFND) to generate income and even grow bigger by putting the products on the market. As we know fish is on high demand in our country even worldwide this will make us win a lot of stake holders like zambeef, kachema meat supply and many more.This can lead people in the community to learn a lot from this project by making it an agricultural college,from this idea even the already existing market in the community will also benefit.
