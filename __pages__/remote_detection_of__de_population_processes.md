The platform has been created with the idea of establishing a sustainable framework that would capture depopulation and factors affecting the occurrence or dynamics of this process in Serbia. In addition to traditional data sources that quantitatively measure the level of population change in Serbia, the platform also relies on alternative sources (e.g. satellite images of nightlights, digital terrain model, GHS Population Grid datasets). Various datasets have been taken into consideration in creating a set of indicators for depopulation monitoring in the territory of Serbia, based on numerous factors that influence the occurrence of this process and determine the tendencies of spatial expression and changes in their intensity. The offered interrelated dataset is of great importance for monitoring the overall population and developmental changes, and it also offers the possibility to predict their future scenarios.
