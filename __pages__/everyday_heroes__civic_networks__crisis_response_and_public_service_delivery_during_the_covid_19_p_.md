## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- The case of COVID-19 response in Thailand has demonstrated the criticality of whole-of-society approach in developing social innovation for effective crisis response and recovery. During the past 2 years, we have witnessed an unprecedented level of expansion in the engagement by civic networks and their growing contribution in overcoming the crisis. The way we work together can be in itself a form of social innovation. Fostering civic engagement and leveraging the expertise and resources of every sector of the society can be our pathway towards a more resilient future.  - With an insider perspective of the affected populations, civic networks help to close the gaps by applying innovative and human-centered approaches to public services delivery. - Unbounded by institutionalized constraints, civic networks are able to work in a more agile and flexible manner, complementing existing public services delivery. However, there are challenges in the area of long-term resource mobilization. - Civic networks are situated in the broader context of their locality and thus their contributions are determined also by the socio-political set up in the local areas. Mutual trust between local stakeholders and the focus on the common good form the very foundation for a fruitful civic engagement.  - Fostering civic engagement drives changes at a deeper level. The engagement does not only create a positive impact for the target beneficiaries but also installs the sense of ‘agency’ within the individuals in the civic networks. Instead of waiting for someone to offer help, individuals realize that their actions can make a difference
