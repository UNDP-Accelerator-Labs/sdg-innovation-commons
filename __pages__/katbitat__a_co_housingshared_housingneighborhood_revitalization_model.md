The solution is to present a 'co-housing' model to a pilot building selected from among the vacant examples of civil architecture and renovate the building according to the spatial organization required by the model. While this model is an alternative solution to conservation and housing problems, it will also set an example for solidarity-based solution proposals sought in other regions of Turkey with the governance and sustainable process design model for the revitalization of cultural values.
