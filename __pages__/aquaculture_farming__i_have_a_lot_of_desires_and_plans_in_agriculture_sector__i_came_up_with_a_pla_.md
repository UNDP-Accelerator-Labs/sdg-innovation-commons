> Title of the innovation

Aquaculture farming, I have a lot of desires and plans in agriculture sector. I came up with a plan for fish farming this year, I have made 6 large fish ponds. Am seeking for financial support to promote my idea of fish farming. The fish ponds are lacking fry(fish) that's my biggest obstacle.

> Brief description of the innovation

I intend to start fish farming, so that I can contribute to the growth of aquaculture in my country. And the production will create employment for the local people who are within the farm. This project won't just benefit me but also my country at large. I will be supplying for my community with fresh fish for the locals and for that it will be at advantage for them. The 6 fish ponds are just for the beginning, once am sponsored I have plans for my farm to diversify the aquaculture farming at my farm at a wider range. Once i expand in aquaculture, I will also venture into other farming platforms such as poultry farming, keeping animals and vegetable growing. Poultry and animal manure will play a large role at the farm, cause it will be used for vegetable growing. In conclusion, help me out financially I desire alot in agriculture sector. I want to contribute to my country's agriculture sector growth locally and internationally. By this I will create employment as well for my people.

The fish which I will be producing will be of good quality and of this am with full certainty. I will will be supplying local fish companies, pick n pay and Shoprite. By this our country's GDP Will be at high amount and this will promote economical growth. When I expand with fish farming, I will start supplying internationally.
