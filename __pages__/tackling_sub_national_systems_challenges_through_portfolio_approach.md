## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

In 2023, A-Lab Mongolia developed two action learning plans.

1. Supporting creation of Sustainable Finance Portfolio in Mongolia

2. Supporting creation of Sustainable Livelihood and Environment (SLE) Portfolio in the CO.

Under the SLE portfolio, CO is providing support to the system by establishing a partnership framework between local governments of Zavkhan province and different projects of UNDP. This collaboration aims to tackle complex development challenges surrounding ordinary herder communities. A joint action plan formulated through a reframing and mapping exercise involving local stakeholders, prioritizes coordinated interventions. The interventions focus on addressing pastureland degradation and overgrazing, exploring value chain and livelihood opportunities, improving waste management of animal slaughtering. The plan also aims to improve availability of veterinary services, building herders’ knowledge and skills related to sustainable livestock breeding and pasture utilization. The local governments have committed budgetary resources to implement the joint action plan in 2024. The effective partnership in Zavkhan province,  established through a portfolio approach, will serve as a model for other regions to follow and actively participate in the transformation of the system.

 



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The development of the SLE portfolio is currently underway, encompassing two program areas within the Country Office (CO) and sub-national governments. A-Lab is engaged in discussions with program officers and senior management to determine the most effective handover process.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Focus group and issue mapping methods were selected to narrow down the focus of the portfolio approach to a specific locality. Previous definition of the challenge was broad embracing national level issues.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used combination of solutions mapping and co-creation methods to ensure that the local actors have a sense of ownership and actively contribute to crafting solutions that they deem suitable for driving change.


## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge.

> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

We worked with three sub-national governments at province and lower level. In addition, we integrated UNDP's five different projects. Two projects had established partnership with the subnational governments. We aimed to build on their work and expand involving other projects to help the sub-national governments do systems change with the support of the UNDP projects through multiple and coordinated interventions.

The selected sub-national governments expressed their interest to work with UNDP projects within portfolio framework. A joint action plan for 2024 was developed to address challenges faced by the local communities and the local governments approved approximately 440 million Mongolian tugrugs (USD 128,000) as cost sharing for the execution of the action plan. 

The Sustainable Livelihood and Environment Portfolio will focus on multiple intervention points including local policy change, local economic solutions, and herders’ behavioral change.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Had we continued collaborating solely with the national government, we wouldn't have gained insights into the challenges encountered by local communities, nor would we have discovered the eagerness and dedication of sub-national governments to collaborate with us in establishing a partnership based on a portfolio approach.
