> Anticipated Social Impact

Public and private taxi and bus drivers have one common challenge according to our research findings; start up fuel for the day after  cashing all previous day’s money. Usually  the fuel light is on red.

In addition, private fleet owners and private motorists are faced with fuel challenges from time to time thereby affecting their operations and mobility. In other ways, our target market is faced with a problem of lack of cash to buy fuel for their errands, preclusion from accessing credit from mainstream financial service providers and exposure to the risk of contracting Covid-19 due to frequent physical cash handling.

Fuel is a life blood of any economy. It turns the wheels of the economy. Therefore, our innovation of the All-in-One (AiO) Dijifuel card system is aimed at ensuring that public taxi and mini bus drivers and others have access to fuel money at an affordable interest rate to support the business operations. furthermore, our innovation ensures that our target market is financially included into the financial mainstream, and aslo reduces the risk of contracting Covid-19 by promoting digital transactions.

Our innovation is relevant to the target market in that we are offering affordable micro loan facility through a card based system. We are also promoting financial inclusion. Our target market has been outside the mainstream financial service providers. Our product is an answer to Governments Policy on financial inclusion and Smart Zambia Policy. Our innovation reduces physical cash handling in filling station (Public Fuel Stations) thereby reducing the risk of spreading Covid-19 through frequent physical cash handling. It also reduces cash pilferages at the filling station and financial loss to armed robbery. 

Our research has also shown that most of the taxi and mini bus drivers are not adequately insured. Our innovation provides micro insurance life covers through PARTNERSHIP with a leading insurance company as an added value.
