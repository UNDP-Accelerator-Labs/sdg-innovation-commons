## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Collective intelligence leverages the knowledge and insights of a diverse group of individuals. By involving a broad range of stakeholders, you tap into varied perspectives, experiences, and expertise, enriching the data collection process. Same for the design thinking that emphasizes understanding the problem from the user's perspective. This approach helps in framing the data collection process around the specific needs and challenges faced by the end-users, ensuring that the collected data is more relevant and actionable.
