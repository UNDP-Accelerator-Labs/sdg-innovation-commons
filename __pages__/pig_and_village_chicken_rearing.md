> Title of the innovation

Pig and village chicken rearing

> Brief description of the innovation

We started with two pregnant sows in march 2020, after the two farrowed we had 8 and 9 piglets respectively. Our pigs have increased to more than 100%. We sale porkers at the age of 6 to 7months old, the money realized help us to buy feed. In the end of cleaning the piggery we gather the pig dung and store it in a covered area for a few days where the dung produces maggots which in turn is given to the chicken as feed and we anticipate to fatten the chickens for good sales. In the coming future we intend to use the pig dung as biogas for energy use.   Chickens we buy day old and we feed them to the point of laying eggs and we plan to increase them before we start selling. Cockerels are for meat consumptions while the hens we are keeping for laying eggs and we use chicken manure for our vegetable growing.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We sale our products to butchery and shop owners , with this we generate a 
 minimum income that assist us with buying feed and medication for the pigs and chicken. This also assist us in helping our immediate and extended family in the little way we can ( in school needs, and other social needs). We are currently seeking more market especially for those who intend to rear and also those multi supermarkets, hotels and multi companies like Master Pork who buy in big numbers. This will however be practical upon our expanding our current piggery and poultry structures. As the value added innovation on environment, we look at the important point being Capturing value  and creating value, our bottom objective is to ensuring we create a successful business involving the search of providing value in terms of marketing our products, processing meat , smoking and branding the packages, providing a service to chain supermarkets and ensuring our product are very competitive in price and quality.  We keep our animals in a very secure and clean, habitable environment.

> Technical Feasibility

From the time of piglets and chicks being born, we ensure they are given the best care they deserve, meaning we will ensure the environment they are being kept is clean and fumigated, thereafter we give them the necessary Vitamins and medication until they are ready for market sale, this in turn ensure our product have the quality ensuring they are fit for consumers, sustainability and capacity that we are able to market then to either big butchery owners and chain supermarkets. There are challenges we encounter from time to time e.g., abnormal behaviors, gene abnormalities and undergrowth on some. We also experience high feed costs and transboundary diseases . We make sure we change the boar when it has out grown because this makes us  start having reduced birth rate. When we win this challenge prize it will help our business grow by expanding  the piggery, branding our products, adding value to the meat  by making other process by products like Hungarian sausage polonies and smoked spare ribs , and increase man power by employing two more persons to help around.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation has  enables us in employing others, we currently have employed two men who are assisting in the piggery chicken run and in the garden, we give them accommodation and a basic salary that enables them to support their young families in taking their children to school, provide them with basic needs.  The  supply of  pig and chicken meat to the consumers  we are able to contribute to the country food basket,  economically through providing employment.
