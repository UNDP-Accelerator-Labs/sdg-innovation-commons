## EduCube is an EdTech startup dedicated to bridging the educational and digital divide in Sierra Leone. Our mission is to create solutions that empower communities through education and technology. CEO of EduCube, "Our primary focus is on students from rural communities where many children have never encountered a computer. In villages lacking a digital center, how can we ensure they have access? How can we guarantee that every school in these areas has a digital center within the next three years? The good news is here: Educube"
