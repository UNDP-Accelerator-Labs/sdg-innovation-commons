e-Labor Market Maker for Less Skilled Workers

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?




1- Exploring

I did not have to go too far to observe people crowding at the corner of the main street nearby my home. Day workers rushing toward cars and incomers to offer their services, which vary with respect to their skills (construction, plumbers...etc.). One factor in common they have is that every day is an absolute struggle to put food on the table for their families.


2- Interview, Information and Data collection

I approached a group of workers and asked what their main issues were and how to make their work pursuit better. The answers were several but a common one was SPEEDING UP the matching process. In fact, the matching between the customers seeking workers and the day laborers is hard to establish. This is mainly due to the information asymmetry, some workers pretending they have sets of skills they don’t in desperately attempting to match the customers offers (This leads the confidence of customers to deteriorate) ...etc.


3- Solution Mapping

I immediately considered a matching solution. How about an electronic platform or an application that acts as a labor market maker for less skilled workers (in reference to financial market makers which match bids and asks)? This will tremendously speed up the recruitment process cycles making the workers to benefit more from it.


4- Originality and Ethics

Excited about the idea, I sought to verify its originality and if anyone else came up with such a solution in advance. For doing so, I engaged in online research, social media and exploited some personal connections for that purpose. And the answer was YES! A group of young researchers came up with a very similar idea to address the problem of crowding of less-skilled workers. Their perception comprises a speeding up solution to the matching process through an application they are trying to develop.


5- Interviewing the Group of Researchers

The young researchers were interested in developing the application, however, they blame the lack of financial means to pursue their goals.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The needs answered by the solution can be listed as follow:

Clearing up or lowering the crowding in the main streets of the city.
Reducing the intensity of traffic congestion.
Benefiting workers with low income and skills (SDGs 1 and 2).
Contributing in employment formation (SDGs 8).

Reducing the risk of contracting the covid-19 among workers.





> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?


A main lesson can be learned from this observation. That is, well designed and tailored local solution can have a substantial impact on people’s livelihood. The impact of local solutions on SDGs targets can have an amplified effect through the dynamic nature of learning and solving at smaller scales. This is particularly true when it comes to jobs creation for the pool of less skilled workers, where the effect on the wellbeing of the poorest laborers can be felt considerably.
