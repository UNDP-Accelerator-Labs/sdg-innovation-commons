Profile Innovator, Mr. Mathew V hails from the Ernakulam (Koch/Cochin) district of Kerala. Purpose Mr. Mathew V  has has made improvised  kerosene stove with gravity fuel tank and cylindrical wick.   Technical details The stove comprises  a fuel regulating valve fitted at the bottom of the fuel tank where a hole is provided. Fuel regulating valve consists of a stopper fastened on a pin that is fixed on the tank with the help of a metallic lamp. A spring is kept in between the metallic lamp and stopper. With the action of the spring, the hole in the tank remains closed at all times except when the tank is placed upside down on the kerosene tray as the pin of the fuel regulating valve touches the inside  bottom of the kerosene tray and pushes up the stopper. The free flow of kerosene into the tray from the fuel tank through the valve and when the kerosene tray is filled up to the level of the valve, the flow of kerosene stops automatically because of the gap through which air enters into the fuel tank is covered by kerosene in the tray. A fuel feed tube is connected to the kerosene tray. Burners are fixed on the fuel feed tube and a cylindrical wick is placed on the burner. The wick consists of an asbestos sheet covered with a brass mesh. The kerosene flows from the tray through the fuel feed tube into the bottom of the cylindrical wick placed on the burn and in turn, the fuel level in the kerosene tray falls. The process continues until the fuel flow through the fuel feed tube  stops by knob. Benefits Frequent cleaning is not required. It easy to clean, no smoke and no sound is produced by this stove. The pressure is not required. The efficiency of the stove is higher and it is reducing fuel consumption of the stove.
