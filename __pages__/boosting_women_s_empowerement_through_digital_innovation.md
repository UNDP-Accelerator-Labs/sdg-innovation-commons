## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Boosting women's empowerement through digital innovation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

In Mauritania, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is difficult to measure because of social taboos that prevent the victims to publicly denounce that phenomenon. Victims of gender-based violence (GBV), including sexual violence, face enormous difficulties in receiving minimal care. The observed obstacles are the lack of knowledge of the procedures approved by the Mauritanian government, as well as the high cost to families in terms of time and financial means. Our main challenge is (1) the existing gap in the official data released by the government and that reported by the CSO working in the field, (2) there is no legal framework to protect women from gender based violence in the Country, and (3) the lack of a real coordination between different sectors to better manage this phenomenon.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

GBV is not new to the National context and the most prevailing type of it are Female Genital Mutulations (FGM), early dropping out of school, forced child marriage among others. This is mostly caused by the patriarchal system prevailing in the country, the socio-cultural norms, poverty and economic inequality. Added to this the fact that there is a lack of legal framework to protect women against GBV to date. This has been exacerbated by the fact that most women fail to denounce that they are victims of violence. Females and vulnerable groups in general are the the ones who are directly affected by issue as well as the state which has the role of protecting the victims from this violence. There exist many effects related to GBV among which one can cite the social stigmatisation and isolation, the psychological traumas, physical damage and economic consequences. GBV has a significant economic consequences for survivors and their families including lost income, medical expenses, and post-trauma healthcare treatment cost.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

One of the weak signal observed is the recent abstention from adopting the legal framework (law) on GBV in Mauritania by the parliament twice. Also, despite the lack of data, we are observing that there is an increase in the number of violent cases. Moreover, there is no well coordinated actions involving security forces, medical aid and judicial intervnetion related to VBG in the country.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The theme for International Women's Day 2023 is ‘DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality’. The Lab would like to align its work with this campaigns. To do so, the Lab aims to seize this opportunity to put forward its methods, knowledge and experience in the field of innovation and digital transformation to promote gender equality and women's empowerment. The Lab envisages working collaboratively with local organisations and community members to build strong relationships to be able to create more impactful solutions, while paying particular attention to the cultural sensitivity. In fact, as the UNDP Unit responsible of innovation and well informed on digital solutions, the Lab is well positioned to take his challenge and work on.
