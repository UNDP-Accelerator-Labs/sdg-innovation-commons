> Title of the innovation

POULTRY.  Turkey farming

> Brief description of the innovation

Turkey farming is the next big thing in the Zambian (Africa) food production development. With the rapid increase of Zambian population, there is need to diversify and implement innovative plans to support and keep up with the food production chain.with chickens been the leading bird in poultry industry, turkeys have a huge potential to do better, that is because turkey farming can produce meat, eggs and feathers, all of which can generate an income. Turkey's meat is high in nutrition, such as proteins and  is leaner(have low fat content) which reduces the risk of cholesterol diseases. A turkey is twice the size of a chicken, which means more meat, therefore turkeys are definitely a go-to product.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Turkey farming will generate various streams of income, which includes;
1) Income from turkey meat, which is the main and Core stream of income.
2) income from rearing a small rafter of aesthetically pleasing ( looking) turkeys, of which we can sale to parks and hotels. We can also harvest furthers for sale to decor makers.
3) the third stream of income will come from the production ( manufacturing) of compost manure which will be properly packaged for sale to Farmers both locally and international.
The income generated will further lead to the launching of other projects that add to the value chain, like restaurants which will only host turkey meat. 
    The challenge prize will help launch the business into operation,with the aim of poultry diversification and food development. The lack of financial support is what is keeping this innovative plan from launching, but with the challenge prize the future is bright.

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation plan is categorised in three stages which includes;
* The first stage is to secure a piece of Land to sustain and support turkey farming. this should include enough water and space.
* The second stage is shelter. We need to make turkey Coops (houses) with enough ventilation ,light and should also allow for temperature regulations. Having worked as a metal fabricator makes the task even easier and cost effective labour-wise.
*The third stage is to put a labour team together and take into consideration the production chain of which should consist of a continuous production line from poult to full grown turkeys and off to the market.
   Note: the most important part of the implementation is the buying of high breed turkeys which  are bigger and high resistance to diseases. Choosing the right type of high quality feed and a proper disinfecting plan to keep the birds safe and healthy.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The implementation of this innovative plan will create employment to local people and will contribute to the food chain (development) of which the people of zambia and Africa at large will enjoy. 
The poultry industry is estimated to be worth $35.5 billion as of 2020, of which almost 20% is turkey market. 
*With everything in full swing, we can be able to produce more than 10 thousand turkeys in less than 2 years.
