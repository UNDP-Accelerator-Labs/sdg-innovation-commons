> Title of the innovation

Glambiz Fashion Magazine.

> Brief description of the innovation

I would like to bring Fashion and Business closer to the Zambian people. We do not have enough if any magazine dedicated to showcasing designers, models, arts &amp;culture and the fabulous life of local fashion and runways.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By exposing our local fashion designers to the rest of the country, region and subsequently the world, we will be inviting buyers and bringing in more income in the tourism industry and the magazine itself.

> Technical Feasibility

We are creatives in the world of print media. We will be covering Business and Fashion (Art &amp; Culture). And our layout is spontaneous.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will help inspire a young designer and fashion model out there find their passion and pursue it. The current market is ripe especially now that the economy is stabilising and we are ready to serve information that will help more young designers and artists find a place to exhibit their work.
