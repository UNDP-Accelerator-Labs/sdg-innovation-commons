## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

A volunteer-driven crowdsourcing approach to tackling online misinformation using the Healthy Internet Project (HIP) platform
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that online misinformation and disinformation is becoming more prevalent and posing a significant challenge to public health, public trust and social cohesion. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenge of disinformation and misinformation in the digital age has increasingly come into focus in recent years and is certainly at the fore now with the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the phenomenon of ‘fake news’, which refers to the intentional and unintentional spread of false or inaccurate information. A global pandemic creates just the right environment of fear and anxiety to be the ideal Petri dish for misinformation and disinformation to thrive. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic provides an important case study on how these two types of information overlap or work in powerful parallels due to the diverse nature of how the disease is experienced and the socially divisive way in which it has been tackled in some locations. For example, the public health and social cohesion effects of mis- and disinformation highlight the urgent need to understand the link between identity, trust in information and authorities, and the impact of developing narratives on the course of the pandemic. If not addressed, mis- and disinformation can undermine civic culture by promoting general mistrust and encouraging sub-optimal behaviours.   Any successful efforts to identify and flag misinformation depends on audiences’ ability to effectively and critically evaluate information they come across. It is however well established in behavioral science research that this process of critically evaluating information is “cognitively expensive", particularly on digital information platforms such as social media tools, where users are often bombarded by a barrage of information every time they refresh their home pages (Rand et al). This explains why it’s easier for most people to fall for false information, because the human mind can only process, hold and critically evaluate so much information in a short period. By understanding how different types of audiences evaluate information, stakeholders keen to address mis- and disinformation can begin to identify effective strategies and interventions to encourage audiences to consume and critically evaluate information better.

1) Social media data - scanning of trends on social media platforms like Twitter and discussions on platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram on the challenge of misinformation, within the Covid-19 landscape, and for the broader social, political and economic fabric of the society  2) Collective intelligence sourced through the 2020 Creatives Innovation Challenge - this was an experiment to test the effectiveness of harnessing the creativity of youth at community level to develop engaging, interactive content to support Covid-19 public health messaging. 9 youth groups from different parts of the country were engaged and they used participatory bottoms-up approaches to map the misinformation happening at the community level and co-design targeted media content to address this. 3) UNDP Guidance note on Covid-19 information pollution developed by the Oslo Governance Centre

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Acc Lab is connecting unique partners (Busara Centre, TED, etc) on the emerging challenge of misinformation and how that relates to public trust, for quick experimentation building on the existing Healthy Internet Project prototype tool to generate actionable insights that are relevant to the UNDP Governance portfolio, particularly pertinent in light of the coming election year in 2022. This challenge is part of the bigger picture on youth empowerment & engagement with public processes and systems which is a key lever towards making progress on the priority focus area of the Lab which is youth unemployment.

In January 2021, the UNDP Accelerator Labs announced their partnership with the Health Internet Project (HIP), incubated at TED (Technology Entertainment and Design) to pilot a multi-country experiment to test the crowdsourcing approach to tackling online misinformation. HIP is a prototype tool that uses a volunteer-driven approach to crowdsource misinformation on the internet, allowing users to flag both the best and worst of the internet. Acc Lab Kenya is one of the countries involved in the multi-country experiment.
