## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Increasing access to LearningTools and Equipment on a Remote Island using 3D Printing
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is Union Island in SVG is the most distant island in SVG and therefore the cost of transporting items inclusive of learning tools and equipment is expensive.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



There is limited access from the mainland since it is restricted to a ferry and small aircraft which restricts the movement of people, equipment and other resources this has therefore hindered economic development and diversification.

There is limited national funding for conservation activities which has placed a burden on civil society and NGOs. This can lead to the instability of ongoing conservation efforts for example the Union Island Gecko

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Creation of a model which utilizes future skills to enable citizens of the remote island to build, create and design learning tools and equipment that would enable them to 1) Create income from tourists and diversify tourism products 2) reduce the need to import some learning tools and items. 3) Provide an opportunity based on the pilot to upgrade their curriculums to include modern and future skills for youth such as 3D printing.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



UNDP Acc Lab in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean increasing access to learning tools and equipment on a remote island. This initiative addresses critical needs of a vulnerable population and closes the gap.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Can the access to needed learning tools and equipment be increased through the use of 3D printing in Union Island.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Conduct workshops and training exercises on the use of the 3D printer. We will also train participants on how to create 3D models based on the priority areas of the island. We will then execute pilots using these tools printed in Union Island to test their effectiveness in that given space.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



This would be the first use of 3D printing technology on the remote island in the Caribbean.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
