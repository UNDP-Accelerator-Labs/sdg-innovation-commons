> Brief description of the innovation

Molasis is placed in trays made of used empty containers and placed in the field 5miters apart from one station to the other which trap the adult tuta. Also molasis is used in a spray mix at 200mls per 20lts spray mixed with crown at 10mils 20lts water. Then sprayed on too the plant. Benefits. 1. molasis act as a sticker. 2. the stickness of the molasis prevent egg hatch. 3. molasis
has some trace element needed by the plant. 4. molasis prevent tuta from developing resistance to chemicals.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation of molasis use in the control of Tuta in tomatoe production will reduce the cost of production on buying insect trappers and high use of chemicals. The quality and quantity of tomatoes will improve they will be less or zero tuta damage. when this happens it will mean improved yield per hac  and reduced cost of production.  The price of tomatoes will fetch a higher price. This will intale increased income. Other farmers arround will benefit by coming to learn from my innovation and our quality and quantitie of tomatoes will improve and together we shall be able to meet export standard and demand.

> Technical Feasibility

Empty 5lts container is cut in half and molasis at a right texsture is pulled in the half containers and placed in the tomatoe row at 2, 3, 4, 5 miters apart depending on tuta.infestation.

As a spray: 200mls of molasis is mixed in a 20lts sprayer mixed with a pesticide called crown at 5 to 10mls depending on infestation. Them mixture is sprayed on tomatoe plants.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In a word full of pests, chemical control is becoming very expensive to small scale farmers. Molasis use will help lower the cost of production of tomatoes. Molasis is user.and environmentally very friendly. The community will benefit by producing tomatoes at a lower cost.
