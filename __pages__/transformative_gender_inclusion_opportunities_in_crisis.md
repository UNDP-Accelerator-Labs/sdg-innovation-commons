## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Men in Lebanon respond better to the mental models of "calling them into home-care duty" vs. "Calling them for not doing home-care duty" / - Men in Lebanon are largely and with statistical significance driven by "self-independence" as a value and behavioral driver behind engaging in-home care duty / Learning, Mastery, and self-efficacy are proven incentives to engage and retain men in content that can be expanded beyond home-care and into other social norm areas/ - Men in Lebanon are successfully and with statistical significance triggered to action through tactics of gamification and social proofing / sel-signaling.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes majorly a constant crisis whereby the challenge keeps growing and dwindling within the mental landscape of targets. However, this has been reframed as opportunity, as crisis becomes a time of transformation even for the most archaic of norms. The pain threshold is higher than the gain of normalcy, hence we have a very critical opportunity to actually drive social norm change in a measurable way that can impact women at work, in public spheres, in leadership, and at home.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- UN agency research has centered on "self-reported" surveys and attitudinal data, even in its longest-standing study on "masculinities" data stems from what men self-report on their desire, motivation, and actual quantification of participation in-home care duty, to actually investigate and move the needle on this front & ensure a sustainable spillover effect to our areas of concern in women's lives we actually needed to get behavioral data from men themselves outside of an "interrogation" framework and by simulating "natural choice architecture environment" / - in the past 2 years post-blast, financial crisis, and covid impact there has not been a holistic approach to research on impacts of cumulative crisis on gender and social norms, not mainly in terms of the negative impacts but also what are the levers that crisis has inflamed for us to enter into this space to engender sustainable change? 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We needed to reach people where they are and without adding to their cognitive overload, so we decided to use gamification and social media as the main methods to reach men, as we iterated and with mounting evidence we were able to reach our latest learning cycle which is a beta self-learning academy for men. More than 200 requests of thousands of visiting men actually specified more content that they wish to see such as taking care of sick kids, time management, conflict resolution, cooking....
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We will be working with in the coming year / only partner so far is UNWOMEN 
## End
