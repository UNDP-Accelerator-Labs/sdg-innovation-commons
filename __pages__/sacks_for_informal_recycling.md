Yellow trucks for solid waste collection are private small enterprises. They´re picking un-classified waste from 14 municipalities in addition to Municipality of Guatemala (the largest city in the country). They have acknowledge that recycling material is a mean to increase a little more their earnings. Therefore, they have managed to use this "with plastic large sacks" to sort the waste along the routes of each yellow truck, delivering the classified waste to informal brokers inside and around the Municipal Landfill. This is the back bone on an informal recovery chain.
