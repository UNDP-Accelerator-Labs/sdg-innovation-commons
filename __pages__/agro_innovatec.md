## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

AGRO INNOVATEC

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

10/05/2024

> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The Agro-INNOVATEC focuses on driving technological innovation in Bolivia's agricultural sector. It aims to integrate modern technologies like AI, drones, and irrigation systems to address climate change, enhance crop productivity, and promote sustainable farming practices. The project emphasizes collaboration among experts, students, and agricultural leaders to create solutions that will improve food security and help farmers adapt to environmental challenge

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This experiment is important because it addresses critical challenges in agriculture, including climate change, limited resources, and the need for higher crop yields, all while promoting sustainability and technological advancement in farming​.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF participants in the Agro-INNOVATEC workshops receive specialized training and opportunities to pitch their projects, THEN they will develop innovative agricultural solutions that can be accelerated by financial institutions, leading to more sustainable and productive agricultural practices in Bolivia.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:

Workshops with Specialists:

Held two-day workshops in each city, engaging participants in training sessions focused on accelerating agricultural projects.

Collaboration:

Worked with civil society, academia, and the Productive Development Bank of Bolivia to provide training and mentorship.

Pitching to Experts:

Participants pitched their projects to a panel of experts, allowing them to receive valuable feedback and guidance.

Selection of Winners:

From these workshops, 6 winners were selected, whose projects are now being accelerated by the Productive Development Bank of Bolivia.

> If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

- Civil Society
- Academia
- Government (&amp; related)

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The original hypothesis—if participants receive training and pitch their agricultural projects, they will develop innovative solutions that can be accelerated—was proven. As shown in the results from the workshops, multiple projects demonstrated innovation, sustainability, and scalability in areas such as horticulture, renewable energy, and waste recycling. The selected six winners, such as Baby Plant and BZZY, showed significant potential and are now being supported by the Productive Development Bank of Bolivia for further acceleration

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

Most Important Learning Outcomes:

Improved Project Development: Participants gained valuable skills in project acceleration, turning agricultural innovations into viable solutions.

Collaboration and Innovation: The workshops fostered multisector collaboration between civil society, academia, and financial institutions, leading to more creative and sustainable agricultural practices.

Successful Acceleration: Six projects were selected for further support, showing the effectiveness of structured workshops and mentorship.

Recommended Changes:

Expand Access: Broaden participation by including more regions and sectors.

Ongoing Support: Provide continuous mentorship post-workshop to ensure long-term success
