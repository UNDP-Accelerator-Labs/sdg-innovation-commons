> Title of the innovation

Chicken poultry farming

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is based on layering of both village and broiler chickens,am doing my business at a small scale farming and I have come to realize that its the most profitable business in the agricultural sector it involves the proper caring of chickens from the time they are one day old(chicks) to the time they are ready for selling at six weeks of age and the amount of stock feed needed to raise the chickens depends on how many chicks you have.

I started my innovation at a very small scale and been in the business with experience it can been helping me earn a good amount of income for both our family and sponsoring myself for my higher education.The business has a very good market potential at both community and national level it is highly on demand has chickens are on high demand in many areas such has restaurants,hotels and at house level and since my business is at a small scale my market is at house and I do very very well.The challenge prize can really help me expand and do my business at a large scale so has it can be a benefit to both me and the general community and so that I can be able to keep thousands of chickens to extend my market at restaurants and hotel level

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is based on knowledge and experience and due to the high cost of stock feed been able to use my own self made feed be a very big success if all the necessary ingredients where provided has I am already familiar with how self made stock feed is made

> Anticipated Social Impact

Most of the times there is always a time chickens become not available on the market and I can eradicate that through coming up with a strategy to make sure that the chickens always ready and available on the market and it can have the pontetial to increase customers on my side
