The Smart Gas Detector (SGD) is created by the Selangor Fire and Rescue Department, Malaysia. It was produced following a rise in house fire incidents that were caused by kitchen gas. The gas detector is easy to install, requiring only plugging into sockets at homes. The user can also receive notifications through their smartphones. The intelligent automatic sensing device is capable of detecting gas leaks from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), and has high sensitivity. 
If the device detects any LPG (propane) gas leak that occurs in the surrounding, the device will automatically send out signals to the alarm system. The SGD is wifi-enabled, allowing the device to be connected to the internet at all times. The user will also receive a notification through the mobile application that is downloadable to the user's smartphone. Additionally, the user will also be provided with relevant information on compulsory early safety action, as well as emergency contact details that can be contacted through the application.
