The BioUrban 2.0 system developed using filters and microalgae allows cleaning the air of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and PM particles (10 and 2.5) to convert them into oxygen and biomass, benefiting the health of people who interact in the area.

Each BioUrban developed by the company BiomiTech can carry out the work of approximately 368 mature natural trees; it costs approximately 60 thousand dollars and its operation is based on the so-called green technology, designed for the urban and interior sector.
