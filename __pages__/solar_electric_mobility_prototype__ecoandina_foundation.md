> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The concept of electric solar mobility arises after observing the need for short but difficult transfers in the puna and the scarcity and high cost of fuel. In parallel, the region has a high level of solar radiation every day. The project proposes to introduce adapted bicycles with an electric engine and a battery that is recharged through photovoltaic panels located in "Solar Service Stations", which provide a range of about 30 km.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Prototype system

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

  More than 500 people, including decision makers, experienced an electric bike ride. All of them were allowed to give a feedback about their experiences. 

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

People who work in the field and teachers would shorten travel times and avoid the use of fossil fuel. This has both immediate and long-term benefits. This project could be a starting point to achieve a paradigm shift in the Andean region. It would be part of the public debates on innovative clean and renewable energy mobility equipment, not fossil, to be used in urban and rural areas.
