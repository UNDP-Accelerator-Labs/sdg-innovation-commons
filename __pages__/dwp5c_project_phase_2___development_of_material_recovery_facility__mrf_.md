## DWP5C project phase 2 - Development of Material Recovery Facility (MRF) 

UNDP has worked with Binh Dinh Environment Company in Quy Nhon city, Binh Dinh province to build up the MRF model, including technical designs, construction of the MRF’s warehouse and development of a network from both formal and informal sector to collect plastic wastes for MRF. This provided diverse benefits to business sector, local community and the environment. The capacity of MRF is 2-4 tons per day of plastic waste collected from domestic sources of the city. Through the MRF, plastic wastes are segregated by types, removed labels of bottles, baled and be ready to be sold to recyclers to turn them into new production chain as input materials. PET and HPDE are occupied main volume of the MRF’s output, which will be sold to Duy Tan Recycling Company, through an Agreement Principle with the MRF’s operator. To kick off the collection of plastic waste from domestic sources in the city, a MRF Fund has been established and collected 67 tons of plastic wastes, within 6 months, from informal sector and from the central landfill of the city.
