## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

- The actual number of people with disabilities far exceeds reported statistics, as many remain hidden in their homes.

- The educational system, already underdeveloped, fails to accommodate their needs. There are significant gaps in infrastructure, curriculum, and resources for children with disabilities, even in specialised schools.

- There is currently no Somali sign language, but after our involvement, OPDs have started exploring ways to build upon the initial work done toward developing a Somali Braille and sign language system.

- Policies aimed at protecting people with disabilities are either in draft form or have been passed; one policy was passed following an event attended by the President of Puntland.

- Public perception of people with disabilities is highly polarised: they are seen as either the weakest of the weak or, if they strive for independence, as heroes. Both perceptions are detrimental to the development and empowerment of people with disabilities.

> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

The partnership was crucial throughout the different stages of the pilot. Starting from the data collection stage, running innovation challenges, drawing the systems maps and formulating the solution spaces. Partnering with Civil society organisations helped us understand the situation of PWD in the country. And design for them according to their inclusion and needs.
