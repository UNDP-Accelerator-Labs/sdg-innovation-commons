The solution aims to develop a roommate pool for women who are considering divorce but cannot get divorced due to economic concerns, to share the expenses of the house, to meet the need for safe accommodation, to increase participation in employment by realizing the division of labor for childcare and housework, and to create a digital space where women can support each other.
