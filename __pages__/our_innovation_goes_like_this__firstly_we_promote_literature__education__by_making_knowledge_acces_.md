> Anticipated Social Impact

its so relevant in a way that it will stire up the talents people have neglected like writting inovative books on business, politics, agriculture, national developments, and many more areas. it will help improve the reading culture in zambia especially when its done by zambians superheading the reading culture.
knowledge is power as our excellency states it that every is free to have access to education.
it will promote education amongs youths.
after we sell the books, we wiil be feeding people, employing people, as we grow and expand more. 
we make the books, sell and pay others also. 
we will be making reality movies also which will attract international attention into zambia.
we are a team of creative youths below 35. full of energy.  
our program will not motivate people in zambia. it will put money in their pockets.
it will also attract international delegates to come to zambia.
we want to establish this 4major programs to a level that white people, chinese will come and learn and inquire from us. 
we are on our way to the top as we speak. all we need is a little push.
we are stopping now.
we are not giving up at all.
