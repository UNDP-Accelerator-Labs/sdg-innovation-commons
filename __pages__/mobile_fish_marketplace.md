"A traceability solution interface that links the fishermen and the consumer “ from the sea to the plate”. Through the Marketplace, fishermen can also get relevant feedback from consumers, and help build relations between consumers and the fishing communities down to single fisherman. The Marketplace is the cornerstone for fishermen to get compensated for their good practices, therefore expanding responsible practices and improving artisan fishing culture in the coastal communities."
