## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

(i) In the past, the Government of Indonesia focused on developing static maps that contains data on flood mitigation infrastructures, such as natural and artificial lakes. However, there is a need to incorporate qualitative insights such as governance of these lakes, real-time conditions, its relationship and dynamics with nearby communities and so on. Thus, through this project, UNDP Accelerator Lab Indonesia explored the opportunity to utilize open-source software applications that utilized user-generated reports to collate and map data – resulting in a dynamic map that are accessible for both government and public, increasing transparency on data collection processes and overall quality of government’s data. 


(ii) Out of the 170 natural and artificial lakes, 41 lakes (24%) face floods as a prevalent issue, with majority experiencing 1-2 floods per year. Only 5% of lakes endure more than 3 floods per year. 


(iii) Only 45% lake has administrators under different authorities, which are expected to liaise with government for maintenance. This indicates a need for formal structure of government-appointed administrators to ensure efficacy against floods. While the focus was to map the lakes’ location and identify its existing conditions, we unearth a broader issue that contributes to the ability of these lakes in mitigating flood – its governance. These lakes were managed by lake administrators, which differs from official government representatives, staff from private residences to proactive community members themselves. There is a discrepancy in regulation between central and regional governments on how lakes are governed, and who is in responsible - which in turned, determine how well the lakes are maintained or otherwise. 


(iv) A total of 8% of lakes experienced a change in function. The ability of lake administrators to maintain the lakes’ functions is essential to combat flooding. It was identified that several lakes were neglected and disappeared, others were maintained by local communities or privatized by businesses. Majority of evaporated lakes were converted to gardens and open fields or becomes cleared lands for commercial and residential buildings. Meanwhile, other remaining lakes were transformed into communal fishing ponds, small ponds in restaurants or rice field. 


(v) Anticipatory steps are being taken by lakes administrators and nearby communities to mitigate flood, including collective action to clean waste in the lakes and effective management of water flow through inlet and outlets. Another underlying challenge to optimize the lakes’ contribution in reducing flood is land disputes and ownership issues. Strong regulations are needed to provide clear guidelines on ownership, maintenance and responsibilities for the natural and artificial lakes.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

During the data collection processes, there was a massive gap in ensuring gender balance on surveyors' team as well as incomplete dataset submission by our mapping partner. In regards to the substantive results itself, there were relatively no issues as the process increased the quality of government data and enabled better access & transparency of data for both government and public.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Previously, the existing map of lakes that are available to the government were solely confined to static maps developed using drones. Through the use of open-source platforms such as Open Street Map, Ushahidi and Mapillary, the project elevates the types of data integrated for future maps, including geospatial data, qualitative interviews (that captured socioeconomic data) and crowdsourced photos and observation.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The project relies heavily on mapping technologies, particularly the ability to leverage existing geospatial data and survey insights, that were later transformed into an insightful data visualization for the government partners - also employing tools of visual thinking and mapping. The overall project aims to increase government data quality and enable transparency of data collection processes, contributing to Smart Cities development. This pilot project built upon the initiative from the government project in 2021, and was followed up by a citizen science component whereas there is an open call for public volunteers to map lakes in their neighborhoods to complement the existing data.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?



OpenStreetMap Indonesia is a civil society organization that is responsible behind the operations of Open Street Maps application in the country. Throughout the process, they were tasked with identifying the geographical scope, conduct the collective mapping activity and upload these information on open-source platforms that are available for UNDP, government partners and the public.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Project Management Office (PMO) was the government partner that initiated the request for digital mapping to evaluate existing conditions of lakes as part of the urban infrastructure to mitigate floodings. They were heavily involved from the beginning of project design, capacity building of using open-source platforms, verification of data and hand over processes.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Both are new and unusual partner for UNDP: (1) the PMO Office is a newly-established government office that consists of line ministries and regional governments, the first of its kind in the country, that utilizes a portfolio approach to their problem solving. Flood mitigation is one of the eight focus in their portfolio, whereas (2) OpenStreetMap Association is a non-profit organization that focuses on utilizing geospatial data and open-source-platforms for humanitarian issues, in which UNP Indonesia has never initiated partnerships with similar entities before.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This initiative built upon the interest in experimentation by our government partner - PMO Office Jabodetabekpunjur - in pursuit of smart cities targets. They initiated a pilot project on mapping lakes using drones, resulted in a static map of geographical locations of natural and artificial lakes. However, this approach lacked the depth of insights they needed for a data- and evidence-based policy making process. Thus, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Indonesia proposed a data-led innovation project that integrates qualitative interviews, crowdsourced photos and insights from participatory observation while updating the geospatial data of these lakes. In addition to gaining real-time information on the lakes' conditions and assessing its capabilities to mitigate floods, the government also have access to socioeconomic data and other essential information in an ESG framework. Moreover, these data were documented in open source software applications - such as Ushahidi and Mapillary - which represents a dynamic map that encapsulated various layers of data and innovation, prompting the government partner to revisit their approaches in data collection and visualization.  Before this project, the government only focused on one facet of data, thus not being able to gain a "full picture" of the issue. The work was possible due to the novel partnership that UNDP Accelerator Lab initiated with the mapping organization, OpenStreetMap Indonesia which collected and verified the wide array of data, bringing upon rich insights that reflects the complexity around flood mitigation.
