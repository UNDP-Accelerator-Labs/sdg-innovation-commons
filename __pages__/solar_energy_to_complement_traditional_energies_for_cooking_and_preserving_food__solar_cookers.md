> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Engineers, field technicians, students and teachers from the Liceo Agrícola Secondary School collaborated on the practical implementation of solar energy to complement traditional energies for cooking and preserving food. The Lavalle branch of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) has donated a solar furnace to the community of the School of the National University of Cuyo (UNCUYO) as part of a training focused on the use of a metal container-type solar furnace, an alternative with a wooden box and a fruit and vegetable indirect dryer. The session began with the presentation of the solar equipment in the esplanade. Then, food was prepared for cooking, and vegetables, fruits and aromatic herbs were prepared for drying. Subsequently, the topic of renewable natural energies was addressed, focusing on solar energy and the construction of furnaces and dryers
