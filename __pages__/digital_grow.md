## This innovation from Fondacion Ondivia was established in 2017 is a tool with 2 components active in Angola and Mozambique.

It has 1,500 active users and 2,300 registered users and deals with digital advisory through AgriVAS: One to many advisory covering agricultural livestock information and addressing knowledge gaps leading to low productivity. A resource centre - digital library, free access with technical documentation to support family farming, including books, technical articles, videos or practical exercises, being found in 4 languages: Portuguese, Spanish, French and English. The contents of the Digital Library are tailor-made, essentially for the most disadvantaged regions and a virtual Platform that, in partnership with universities and research centres in Africa and Latin America, promotes training at different levels, promoting transfer of know-how and South-South relations. Digital Grow develops technical training tailored and adjusted to the local reality, especially suitable for geographies with weak internet and less sophisticated devices, operating offline. The contents of this training allow the farmer a deeper knowledge of the entire production process and value chain, a better use of resources, a reduction in production costs and an increase in production and income. They use smartphones, a website and dashboard and portal, both local and cloud-based software. Their challenges are understanding the market, and user needs, accessibility, digital literacy and use by marginalized groups. Their funding has come from impact investors and donors and is dependent on them.
