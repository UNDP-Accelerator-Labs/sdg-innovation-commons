> Title of the innovation

Production of soap from organic waste using black soldier flies

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation involves the cultivation of black soldier flies using organic waste form restaurants, markets and hotels. The larvae of the flies are collected and dried.  The oil is mechanically pressed out of the dry larvae, to provide a high fat oil rich in lauric acid, otherwise only found in coconut and palm kernel oils. This oil will be used for production of multipurpose soap . The residue, larvae, cake, is a high protein feed which can be sold to poultry and pig farmers .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As a soap manufacturing company, this innovation will help reduce our costs for procuring waste oils and soaps stock allowing us to produce the products at a lower price. The challenge prize will help us produce this raw material cheaper and be less dependent on edible oil refineries for soap stock who generally prefer selling to larger players. The value addition on the environment is two-fold; reduces organic fraction of waste which is over 60 percent on the fraction and also produces affordable feed for the poultry market and the end product, soap, can be made more readily available in households .

> Technical Feasibility

At the moment, we produce soap from Saponification of used oils, tallow and soap stock purchased from oil refineries butcheries and restaurants. We will start collecting other organic waste from same places and take it to our black soldier fly farm where we will cultivate the larvae.
The larvae will then be dried in solar driers and mechanically pressed to remove the oil. The prize money will be used to purchase the mechanical press and build the solar driers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The proposed innovation will provide employment in form of waste collectors and staff on the farm as well as additional people for the new equipment. 
There will be a marked reduction of food waste which will result in reduced air pollution.
Availability of affordable soap for communities will result in improved hygiene.
