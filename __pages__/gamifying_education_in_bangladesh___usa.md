The Tech Academy in 2013 is known as the first institute in Bangladesh to teach robotics institutionally to school children. It offers Robotics, Animation, Game Development courses that are gamified and designed to enhance kids ability to learn, think and grow to become the better version of themselves. TTA has been treading an unconventional path while trying to prepare children. They have developed a fascinating class-room model by replacing regular classrooms with a gamified experience. The schools can take advantage of what Tech Academy has accomplished and implement them in their own institutions.
The Tech Academy has recently expanded its operations beyond Bangladesh to San Francisco, USA.
