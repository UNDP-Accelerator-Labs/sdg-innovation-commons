## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

 -The youth unemployment challenge in the country has national as well as unique perspectives such as culture and other socio-economic factors across the six different geopolitical zones and share most of the same challenges accessing job opportunities. For example, marginalized communities such as women have a double barrier such as childcare.    -Recruiters have a challenging time finding the best fit and qualified candidates.  Likewise, job seekers lack the requisite knowledge to translate their experience and skills to reflect on their resumes and are concerned about long work gap in their employment history.   -There is a skills gap in some sectors of the economy which short training programs would alleviate and enable youth pivot to sectors with job opportunities. -There is a gap between the education curriculum and the technical skills required for employment. Critical and strategic thinking and problem solving are also key skills and mindsets that should be inculcated into the educational curricula as early as possible.  -There is a lack of awareness of job opportunities all over the country, even in areas with high mobile penetration and internet access, the gap in job matching still persists. The information on job vacancies is mostly disseminated through informal communication on WhatsApp groups and personal connections.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. It was difficult at first to reach communities outside of the city where our lab is located and the outer skirts of country’s innovation capital. So, we decided to embark on a mission trip outside of the financial capital to gather firsthand insights. We also held several webinars targeting different regions in the country. There is a mismatch between the agile nature of the lab and the operations of the country office, which led to logistical challenges as well as financial hindrances in obtaining the reach we desired.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We found that there may be gaps in the information we need to reach those who are marginalized, especially in remote communities. We identified specific economic, social, ethnic, age and gender classes and invited them to in person one on one gatherings and intimate virtual sessions.  Having direct communication with target groups gave us an understanding that we would not have been able to gain with other data methods. We chose these methods, because we were dealing with a complex issue which had multiple stakeholders who sometimes had different perspectives on issues.   They helped us address the challenge of a disconnect between policy makers, employers of labour, formal educational institutions and youth on factors contributing to the problem, and possible solutions. The best method we discovered for research was citizens data, directly from the community we hoped to reach and engage. We utilized direct interviews, webinars, surveys, and target groups for data collection.   

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Direct communication and meetings with targeted groups gave us a deep dive on the issues young Nigerians face. It allowed us to have a richer and more well-rounded understanding of the challenges regarding youth unemployment. These methods helped us get a cross-section of perspectives in situations where the stakeholders could engage and come to shared perspectives or gain new insights on the issues under discussion. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

 We worked with startup communities in remote areas, state led innovation centers and learning centers, vocational training centers and startups.      Lagos Island Connect – We helped surface insights from a needs assessment survey they had conducted on youth and employment in partnership with the Lagos State Government and took part in a collective intelligence session to share these insights and possible next steps.    Start Up South - We worked with Start Up South when engaging the innovation ecosystem in the South-Eastern part of Nigeria. The engagements took place over a 5 day trip to Enugu in November 2021, where we visited a couple of hubs, a university, and the workshops and offices of several actors in that space.     Nigeria Youth SDG Network – We engaged them on several interviews when trying to gain insights on the challenges with youth employment. In addition, they interviewed respondents for a survey on Decent Work carried out by the Industrial Labour Organisation and were able to share insights from this. We also supported the World Youth Skills Day session organized by the Nigerian Youth SDG Network in Lagos, joining the conversation on skills needed by youth employment, post the Covid-19 pandemic. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Pan Atlantic University – We engaged staff from there in a collective intelligence exercise, to which we invited multiple stakeholders to discuss issues around the frontier challenge.  University of Nigeria, Nsuka Campus, provided insight on the challenges startups and youth face specific to the Eastern region of the country with regards to fundraising and employment. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

PWC - roundtable brainstorming, and sensemaking exercise on youth unemployment particular to the Northern region of the country with civil society champions and the Country Office.   Impact Hub Lagos – Impact Hub collaborated with us on the collective intelligence youth unemployment workshop. They provided us with a physical space, internet and co-facilitators that assisted in working the participants in the break-out rooms through the session. We also participated in an SDG youth alliance engagement organized by Impact hub.  Co-Creation Hub (CCHub)  - CCHub Design Lab collaborated with us on the collective intelligence youth unemployment workshop. They provided co-facilitators that assisted in working the participants in the break-out rooms through the session. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Lagos State Sustainable Development Goals and Investment – We worked with them and Lagos Island Connects surfacing insights on the youth and employment needs assessment survey and a collective intelligence session afterwards on insights and next steps.                                         Enugu State Tech Hub for Innovation – We held a one-day meet and greet and informal collective intelligence workshop with the startup and innovation ecosystem as well as policymakers to gain insight on the challenges youth face from the South East geo-political region of Nigeria.    

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The startup up community and the Enugu State Start Up. That was amazing because it allowed us to reach communities that we could never.  

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

United Nations Information Centre (UNIC) - UNIC provided us with the space to work from, they provided us with their official social media Facebook and Instagram handles during our youth unemployment workshops to advertise our event, share live updates and ensure a wider reach in participation.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We were able to understand complex issues around the frontier challenge from experiential points of view of different stakeholders.   Consequently, it helped us gain insights on pain points, levers of change and solutions that were already being used by some stakeholders.
