Sargassum harvester that is scalable and autonomous, providing an electric harvesting solution in the Caribbean. Called "Thalasso," this solution can forecast, contain, protect, harvest, and commercialize sargassum, thus managing its influxes in the region. This also provides a much more affordable option for sargassum maintenance. The idea is to use the sargassum harvested by Thalasso for high value products, such as sargablocks, animal food or fertilizer.
