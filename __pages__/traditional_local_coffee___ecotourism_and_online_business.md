Local coffee (Arabica) planted at the foot of Mt. Kinabalu (1300m asl), Sabah. Traditionally processed and roasted using firewoods. The processing method has been practiced for generations (over 50 years) at a small village called Kiau Nuluh at Kota Belud, Sabah. It is one of the very few local Arabica Coffee available in Malaysia. An ecotourism business was started which took tourists through the traditional coffee farming process where one could see and taste first-hand the farm-to-cup experience. However, during the Movement Control Order (MCO), the entire village found themselves out of a job as around 90% of them had been depending on the tourism sector as their source of income. Fortunately, with the help of the digital platform, they managed to deliver the beans across Malaysia and even received orders from overseas.
