> Title of the innovation

LimaCart

> Brief description of the innovation

Small-scale farming provides a living for more than 60% of Zambia's 13 million people, accounting for 21% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Despite the numerous difficulties encountered by small scale farmers, which are both micro and complex, at least 80% of households benefit from the products. LimaCart was created to address the following issues: food traceability, a 35-kilometer average distance to markets, a restricted market, and a lack of information about crop cultivation. LimaCart is addressing these issues by developing an agriculture-based internet mobile application that provides farmers faster access to agri-finance (input financing), an online marketplace, consulting services, and logistics, which may result in a 5% increase in economies of scale for our farmers. Our primary goal for our clients is to eliminate supply chain inefficiencies by offering a wide range of agricultural products with quick delivery.
LimaCart is and end to end web and USSD based platform that provides farmers with excess to financial muscle through input financing, advisory services, proving an online market and also introduce community support farming.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Zambia's agricultural industry is valued at $4.028 billion, with small scale farmers accounting for 60% of the market value, and our serviceable market accounting for 60% of the overall market value ($2.4 billion) with an annual growth rate of 8%. The portal will offer access to 7.8 million small-scale farmers. LimaCart offers farmers an easy-to-use web mobile application with three subscription options to select from, depending on their specific requirements. Our mobile app is compatible with both Apple and Android devices. Our app includes a feature that allows you to access our services and goods at any time. Our app and website both include a sign-up option that allows users to establish an account, which can be used to track and save information for our business. When a farmer establishes an account and subscribes to the appropriate plan, they get access to the services they have chosen.
Our service is available online and via a mobile application. The average cost of our subscription plan is $12 (k264) a year, which provides a farmer with access to our goods and services.
