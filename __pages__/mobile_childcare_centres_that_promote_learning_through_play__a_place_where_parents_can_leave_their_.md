> Title of the innovation

Mobile Childcare Centres that promote learning through play. A place where parents can leave their children as the report for work, allowing them to bond and spend time with them as they work.

> Brief description of the innovation

Setting up onsite or mobile childcare centres at institution for employee children aged 6 weeks to 23 months. Another plan is to send trained child minders to homes of clients that need someone with knowledge in child care and understands growth and development of Children. With a mobile App that sends daily reports and real time updates on the wellbeing of the child. 

The mobile CCC(Childcare centres) will be  sound proof, tailored made to suit the clients needs but also fully equipped with a mini kitchen to warm food or prepare milk bottles for the children being cared for. A nap and diaper area, toilet potties, play area with soft and hard toys, a mini play gym to keep the little ones active, books for reading and scribbling in, pencils and crayons, play dog, modelling clay, paint.  These centres will foster the theory of learning through play.

The child minders sent to cilent homes,  will serve as care givers of Children and help any child that needs assistance with homework or school assignment. Also teach the children the preliminaries needed to start school such as reading and writing.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Companies can rent these mobile CCC's and hire our trained staff or rent the mobile CCC's and employ their own staff. 
Employees that have infants and small children will benefit from this service as they can bring their children with them as they go for work.  Meaning employees will not have to miss work because they have no one to care for their child.
Companies that hire our services will have self motivated and dedicated  employees because these will always be at work giving their best.  Knowing that their children are well cared for either at home or within reasonable reach at work.
This will allow companies to continue to be productive as very few parents will miss work.
Also most females employed are in the prime of child-bearing years and at the peak of their careers. Female employees can now do both have children and bond with them at the same time  grow in their careers, without the anxiety of being away from their little ones. 
Continued productivity and un-interrupted work flow will be achievable with this innovation. Job creation for many youths, orphans and widows.

> Technical Feasibility

As mentioned we will provide the mobile CCC(Childcare centres)  and set up either at a particular institution or a stragetic location that will allow more organisations to benefit from our services.
Parents can come with their children as they drive for work and drop them off at the centre, allowing parents to bond with their little ones. 

Breast-feeding mothers can continue this important aspect of motherhood without having to drive long distances to get to home and rush back for work.
 Our centres will provide a small nursing room for mothers and an eating area, where parents can enjoy their lunch with their little ones.
We would like to provide this service to organisations such as the banks, ZRA, Napsa, PACRA,various NGO's, UN funded organisations and then move to other organizations that need our services.  Even setting up in malls.
Our centres will be open from 06:00hrs to 20:00hrs, with staff members working alternative shifts.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It has been noted that most people joining the work industry are at the prime of child-bearing years.  Many falling pregnant within the first 23months of work, then having to face the harsh reality of leaving such a delicate infant home and returning to work to earn the much needed income. 

This innovation will allow parents especially mothers to promptly return to work either with their child or leave their child/children with a trained child minder.
Parents can advance in their careers, still earn an income and  bond with little ones while working.  

Companies will also benefit as they will return the best talented and dedicated workers without the possibility of losing such ones to motherhood.

This innovation will also create jobs for many youths including school leavers, widows or any who are willing to be trained and dedicated to childcare .
