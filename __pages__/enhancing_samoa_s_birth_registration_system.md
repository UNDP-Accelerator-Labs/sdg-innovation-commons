## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.     Sensemaking Process provided a different lens to examining the birth registration (BR)system internally and externally.  It made it easier to discover the underlying issues with the BR system that contributed to the delay in birth registration, which is the birth certificate is not mandated as the ‘first’ official identity.  It also provided a good platform for sharing the normal practices from the different external partners in how it ultimately connects with the BR registration and in comparison, to the practice known internally.    2.     Open discussions with SBS and external partners on issues and challenges faced by parents/guardians with BR, provided insights on where the gap is seen from an internal lens. Main challenges are the child being registered at different services with different first names or last names. 3.     Exploring more into the internal BR system revealed that the SBS has restricted access to generate analytics from the BR system due to software licensing issues. This issue has existed since the establishment of the database system in 2002, and due to that fact that it is outdated.  There is a need for SBS to review their licensing contract. 4.     Community conversation brought light into shared knowledge as women village representatives, pregnant mothers, registered midwife nurses, and records officer shared a common understanding of reasons behind the delay/no birth certificate registration. The need to have a law enforcing mandatory BC registration for every newborn citizen was again reiterated in this platform.   5.     The BR shadow mapping provided insights on the flow of the B10 form, and that shared knowledge of this process from the SBS is not the reality in the practical space, as the process starts with registered midwife nurses and ends with the one registered midwife nurse on duty.  This is due to district hospitals having less patients on a daily basis resulting in the Ministry of Health not prioritizing operational budgets to ensure that all district hospitals have a Medical Records Officer (MDO). However, legislative policies under the SBS with regards to the birth registration system requires that all birth notifications uplifted by the BDM division are to be verified and populated by the MDOs as accurate and true. There is a disconnect between the existing frameworks and process and what is actually happening on the ground level.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1.     Government priority – due to general election and having a new government, it really slowed things down and especially in waiting on confirmation of our government partner in their buy in to work in partnership with our frontier challenge.  Plans were either delayed or postpone due to government priority from time to time.   2.     SBS core team commitment – with government priority changing from time to time so as the SBS core team commitment.  Special visits to their office from time to time to show support and encourage them on, took a toll on our end with rescheduling activities, and reshuffling around our work.   3.     Death of the Chief Statistician during the implementation of delivering our activities further delayed the shadow mapping process until the Government of Samoa and SBS had discharged its funeral obligations.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The choice of data assisted us in understanding the BR system internally and externally, and especially in co-designing next phases of the learning cycle such as solutions mapping where participatory observations was used to observe the B10 flow during the BR process shadow mapping.  Additionally, it added value during the BR process shadow mapping through the valuable insights from the community participants. Focus groups assisted with gathering insights from the different partners and actors of the BR system, the system developers, the implementers, and the users.  This enabled us to use visual mapping and issue mapping to document, make connections, and discuss openly with issues as they arise.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We needed to understand the internal system and practice of the BR system, especially unpacking the norm to discover the underlying causes of the challenge.  Thus, we needed to dig internally within the developer of the BR system to the external users of the BR system to have a holistic understanding of the BR system. Portfolio sensemaking, Visual thinking & mapping, provided the platform for open and safe discussions amongst partners involved and especially the involvement of participants from the community.  Where no stone was left unturned in the discussions.  Great insights were gathered due to the fact the SBS and the AccLab worked together in co-creating the design of the shadow mapping phase. When working out in the field, community asset mapping helped with knowing what is available and in good condition/practice and what is needed.
## Partners

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

·       Samoa Bureau of Statistics – our main partner in the frontier challenge as they are mandated to register Births ·       Ministry of Health – registered midwife nurses assisted us in the BR shadow mapping process ·       Ministry of Women, Community & Social Development – assisted us with the BR shadow mapping workshop with the community.  They contacted and confirmed community participants from the Asau District

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

·       Ministry of Health – special as it is the first time having worked directly with registered midwife nurses; those that are known as the ‘ground workers’. MOH is also the most politically charged department in Samoa when it comes to partnerships.
