> Description of the solution

Race To Zero is a UN-backed global campaign to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, investors for a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery that prevents future threats, creates decent jobs, and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth and  to take rigorous and immediate action to halve global emissions by 2030.
To help build momentum, the report highlights promotable actions through a focus on three impact areas, these include:
Passive cooling: Widespread adoption of measures that avoid or reduce the need for mechanical cooling including reducing cooling loads, smart and human centric design and urban planning
Super-efficient equipment and appliances: A ‚Äòrace to the top‚Äô S-curve transformation where the norm is super-efficient cooling equipment and appliances powered by zero carbon energy
Ultra-low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants and insulation foam gases: Market domination of ultra-low (&lt;5 GWP) refrigerants across all cooling sectors and applications.
