## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge was to strengthen the linkages between farmers' cooperative markets and consumers through digital transformation.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Due to the COVID imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions in Nepal, agricultural sector has been highly affected, with direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of farmers.&nbsp; Since there was an uneven distribution of agricultural products within the country due to the lack of market linkages, food waste was observed in high production area while price hike at the urban settlements. Most of the people living in urban areas started to depend on e-commerce platforms for the regular consumption of agricultural commodities in the wake of second wave of COVID in 2020. In one hand, it was a good sign of new market options but on the other hand farmers were compelled to sell their produce with minimal to no profit. Hence, we thought of working directly with the farmers' cooperative markets so that they could enhance their outreach and earn their fair share of investment. We worked together with Cooperative Market Development Programme (CMDP), a joint initiative between the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation and the UNDP Nepal. Our vision was to create a digital platform for the existing farmers' cooperative markets within CMDP so that the farmers could have direct contact with the consumers.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Cooperative Market Development Programme (CMDP) has been constructing and operating farmers' cooperatives markets since 2018 in order to increase quality, quantity and consistency of the supply of fruits and vegetables through infrastructure development, marketing and capacity development. Though the programme has been successful on establishing 50 primary cooperative market collection centers at the local level, 2 district level markets, 2 municipal markets and 2 central level satellite markets, the effect of COVID has negatively impacted on the market linkages. Since the project did not have any plans and resources (both financial and technical) to look into the unintended issues posed by COVID, Accelerator Lab came on board to explore potential ideas for the project.&nbsp; Accelerator Lab together with the project looked into the possibilities of introducing digital marketing platform for the project beneficiaries, i.e. farmers cooperatives. Since Accelerator Lab has prior experience working on digital transformation, we prepared the detail outline and concept for the platform which became an added value for the project. We also have experience working with&nbsp;software developing companies which made it easier for us to scan the existing market for potential vendors.&nbsp; We partnered with Bidhee Private Limited, one of the software developers, to prepare the platform for the project. One of the selection criteria that was made desirable was the cost sharing modality from the private sector, as a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).&nbsp; As a result, we were able to pitch in 40% of the total cost from the private sector and 60% from the Accelerator Lab budget. Apart from that it is worth investing to this challenge since it covers the national priority and both our frontier challenges (urbanization and unemployment).&nbsp;

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our learning question was: "How can we minimize the increasing market gap between the farmers and the consumers and minimize the COVID effects on the lives of people around us, especially the farmers?" In order to work on our challenge statement, we need to understand the need and requirements of the farmers' cooperatives. Hence, we conducted horizon scanning with few of the cooperative markets on the existing gaps and maximizing their reach to the local consumers. This helped us to frame their needs and capacity on handling digital marketing platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Horizon Scanning: It helped us to detect the potential opportunity for the farmers' cooperative markets which have been highly affected by the COVID. The consultations with the cooperative markets helped us to identify the possibility of launching a digital marketing platform as per their current needs and requirements. 2. Participatory Design: Accelerator Lab formulated the initial concept and design for the digital platform which was further refined after multiple revisions and feedback from the ministry and the cooperative markets so that the actual needs and demand of the users and clients could be fully met.&nbsp; 3. Artificial Intelligence: The application uses AI to locate the locations of the users and suggest the markets closest to their area and also suggests products that are frequently been visited by the consumers to minimize their time on searching products.&nbsp; &nbsp;

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The users and members of the application will automatically be loaded in the system which will help to track the transaction as well as preference of the local people on using e-commerce platform as an alternative to buy and sell agricultural products.&nbsp;
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Farmers, Cooperative Markets and local people will benefit from this platform.&nbsp; In order to grow this platform, we are already collaborating with the ministry and few of the cooperatives on testing the platform. We hope to bring onboard and work together with the cooperative associations once this platform gets rolled out and have better traction in the field of e-commerce business.&nbsp;
