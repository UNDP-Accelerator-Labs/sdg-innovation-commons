Deforestation. Burning wood is dramatically less carbon-efficient than burning LPG. Wood consists of 50% fuel. The rest is molecularly-bound oxygen plus left-over moisture. Neither of these burns and vaporising the moisture wastes energy. LPG, by contrast, is all fuel. Per unit of delivered cooking heat, burning wood generates about five times the carbon of LPG. Switching from wood to LPG reduces cooking’s carbon emissions significantly. In Uganda, where much traditional cooking happens, switching from wood fuel to LPG cuts net-CO2 output to the atmosphere by 60%.
Switching 100 households from consuming 200 tonnes of harvested wood a year to consume instead 21.5 tonnes of LPG would save one hectare of forest each year.
