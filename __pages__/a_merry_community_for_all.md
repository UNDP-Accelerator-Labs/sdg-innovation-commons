> Title of the innovation

A MERRY COMMUNITY FOR ALL

> Brief description of the innovation

A MERRY COMMUNITY FOR ALL IS AN INITIATIVE THAT AIMS AT AN EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT WITH WHICH EVERY POTENTIAL OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY IS TURNED INTO A SURVIVAL SKILL. THE MAIN IDEA IS TO TURN THE JUNGLE IN THE HEADS OF OUR YOUTHS IN MY COMMUNITY INTO A SURVIVAL SKILL THAT CAN BRING CHANGE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. 
THIS EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT IS MAJORLY NARROWING INTO THE NON FORMAL TYPE OF EDUCATION. IT IS THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION THAT WILL BEST FACILITATE THIS KIND OF INTIATIVE AS IT ACCOMODATES EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE THE SYSTEM OF LEARNING DECENTRALISED. EACH YOUTH IS TO GO THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CLASSES:
1. MOTIVATION
2. MATHEMATICS
3. ENGLISH
4. NATURAL ABILITIES SUCH AS SINGING, DANCING, MODELLING, TAILORING, ENTERPRENUER AND ART.
A MERRY COMMUNITY FOR ALL NON FORMAL LEARNING'S OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPOWER THE YOUTHS OF OUR COMMUNITY REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUNDS OR SOCIAL STATUS.
IT SEEKS TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO YOUTHS IN THE COMMUNITY AS MANY YOUTHS ARE EITHER SCHOOL DROPOUTS OR HAVE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO GO TO SCHOOL DUE TO VARIUOS CIRCUMSTANSES.
