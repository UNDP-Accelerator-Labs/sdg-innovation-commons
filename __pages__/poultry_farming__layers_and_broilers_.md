> Brief description of the innovation

Broilers: Chickens kept for meat production. 
Layers: Chickens kept for egg production.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income through sales of broiler chickens for meat and the sales of eggs from layers chickens. 
My target market is the local market with the village the project is running from. This will add value to the local people and business for they will not have to travel long distances just to get a try of eggs.
Once the local people are chartered for, I will extend my product to super markets. By doing so Zambia will reduce the import of chicken and eggs from countries like South Africa hence improving our economy.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation will help people to eat healthy and fresh meat and eggs or they will be locally produced hence no need of any chemicals to prolong the shelf life.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve life of others by providing the general public with the opportunity for them to start there own business such as buying eggs for resale.
