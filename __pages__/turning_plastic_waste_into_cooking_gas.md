Plastic waste has attracted widespread concern and attention in Kenya. The rapid rate of urbanization throughout the world has led to the generation of increasing amounts of waste, including plastic waste and this in turn poses difficulties for disposal. The problem is more acute in developing countries such as Kenya. The ban on plastic bags/carriers took effect on 28th August 2017 which is a positive move towards reducing plastic waste. A more constraining issue arises on how to dispose off the current waste. Megagas focuses on the manufacturing of clean cooking gaseous fuel from various polymeric compounds, commonly known as plastic waste. This waste is found easily and cheaply thus making the product affordable and sustainable. James Isedia Mulema the founder of Megagas stumbled on the idea of manufacturing clean cooking fuel during trials to use plastic waste to harvest storm water. In 2014 he harvested his first gas into a makeshift cylinder he had made. Through this innovation, he has provided jobs for the youth by hiring them to collect the plastic waste, the raw material that he uses to produce the gas.
