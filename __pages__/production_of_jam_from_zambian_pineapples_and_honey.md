> Brief description of the innovation

Mwinilunga and Ikelenge districts of the North Western province have the highest potential for production of pineapples in Zambia. These districts also produce some of the finest honey in Zambia. Due to the remoteness and the rural nature of the districts, marketing of the two products especially pineapples have been a problem over a long period of time. This results in spoilage of the perishable fruit during the peak of the harvest season and losses to small scale farmers that grow the fruit. Two companies have been set up in Ikelenge district in order to process some the pineapples produced in the area. The companies are Zambezi Pineapples Limited that produce mainly dried pineapples with a capacity of 1,700 tonnes per week and the new Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) pineapple juice plant with a capacity of 3.0 tonnes per day. Forest Fruits Limited processes honey bought from the same area.
The idea is to produce a jam in Mwinilunga using locally available pineapples and honey as raw materials. The pineapple/honey jam is regarded as a natural and healthy food unlike the sugar-based jam. The jam is an easy way to preserve pineapples for a period over 12 months.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

There is a niche market for products that are regarded as natural/healthy foods and this will be the target market. The customer profile will include Supermarkets (Shoprite, mini-marts, wholesalers, retail stores and groceries. The target market areas will be North-Western, Copperbelt and Lusaka provinces.The selling price of product will be competitive when compared to conventional jams on the market because the raw materials will be bought directly from the farmers/producers.
Manufacturing of jam in Mwinilunga will reduce fruit wastage and contribute positively to the stabilisation of pineapple prices during the peak harvest season. 
I have been making jam using domestic kitchen utensils. The challenge prize will assist me to commercialise the production process by acquiring basic equipment such as a pineapple pulper, jam cooker, a paste filler and packaging materials.
This innovation promotes the production and consumption of natural products that are produced with minimum impact on the environment. The pineapples are produced with minimum use of fertilisers and pesticides, whilst the honey is harvested directly from the wild.

> Technical Feasibility

The process of producing pineapple/honey jam involves a number of steps. Fresh, rip, good quality fruits are selected and washed. Initial processing of the cleaned fruits includes pitting, peeling and coring. The fruits are then mashed using a pulping machine or blender. The ingredients for making the jam are as follows:
•	Mashed pineapple as the main raw material whichimparts a characteristic fruit flavour.
•	Water to control the consistency of the mixture.
•	No/Low Sugar pectin as a gelling agent (optional).
•	Lemon Juice as a gelling agent (optional).
•	Special mild flavoured honey which adds sweetness, aids gel formation and acts as a preservative. 
All the ingredients except honey are mixed in a cooking vessel and brought to boiling point. The honey is then added and mixture is boiled for a suitable period of time in order to archive the right consistence of the final product. The finished product is then packed in 500g jars ready for sale. Samples of the finished pineapple/honey jam are available.
The proposed implementation programme for project is six months and this plan is mainly dependent on the time it takes to procure the specialised jam making equipment.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will generate employment and contribute to industrialisation in a remote rural area. The creation of more agricultural processing industries in this area will reduce crop wastage during
