Description: Fired clay pellets or granules are suitable for hydroponic systems in which all nutrients are carefully controlled in the aqueous solution. Clay granules have a neutral pH and do not contain any nutritional value.

The clay is formed into round granules and baked in rotary kilns. This causes the clay to expand, like popcorn, and become porous. It is lightweight and does not compact over time. The shape of each granule can be irregular or uniform, depending on the brand and manufacturing process.
