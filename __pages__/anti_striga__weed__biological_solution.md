Striga hermonthica (witchweed) is a parasitic weed that attacks and significantly reduces the yields of maize, sorghum, millet, and sugarcane throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Low cost management methods such as hand weeding, short crop rotations, trap cropping, or conventional biocontrol have not been effective. Therefore, the toothpick project is led by a foreign scientist and experts from the Ethiopian biotechnological institute. This solution will:
1. Improves crop yield by reducing the Striga weed. Improving crop yield will lead to food security and economic improvements.
2. Considers the environmental impact for weed management as a locally-sourced agent (vs. chemicals that have toxicology concerns as well as increasing issues with herbicide-resistant weeds - eg. in the last three decades, over two dozen weeds have developed resistance to glyphosate).
3. Operates as a sustainable business – providing an affordable product for farmers as a social enterprise. We have a second economic opportunity for micro agribusinesses to produce our live inoculum at the village level. This opportunity is designed to keep the economy strong at a local level rather than diverting funds out of a village to a large manufacturing center.
