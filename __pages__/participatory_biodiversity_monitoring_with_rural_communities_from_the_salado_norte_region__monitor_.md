## Specific goals

Inquire about the value of wildlife biodiversity through participatory methodologies. 

Produce information that contributes to the management of the territories and the public's awareness in relation to the conservation of forests. 
## Description of citizen participation

The participation of the small-scale farmers association “Unión de Pequeños Productores del Salado Norte” consisted in learning about and validating the proposal for monitoring through camera traps and selecting the sampling community. Delegates from the community of Campo Grande (Santiago del Estero) participated in the design and installation of the monitoring module, and they also received training related to the installation of camera traps and the discussion of results.
