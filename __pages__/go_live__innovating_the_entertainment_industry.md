> Brief description of the innovation

Go Live! is a Media Steaming Application designed for content creators and streamers by Weblogik Limited. It is designed to work on a number of devices including mobile phones and PC, and will be extended to an additional range of internet enabled devices such as Smart TVs etc.
With Go Live!, a content creator will be able to upload content to our digital cloud and make it available to streamers that will access this content at a price. The solution is content creator-centric, and that means it is the answer in so many ways to the question, “How can we make Zambia’s entertainment industry profitable”.
Our application allows content creators to control how their content is served to their audiences by determining their own pricing, schedules and access to this content. Our business model allows these players to get the maximum benefit from our service at the lowest cost and revolutionizes the way people use, look at and think about our entertainment industry.
We have four different types of streaming service categories that encompasses a majority of content produced in Zambia namely, Movies, Reality TV, Series and Concerts &amp; Live TV.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Go Live! is a Media Steaming Application designed for content creators and streamers. It is designed to work on a number of devices including mobile phones and PC, and will be extended to an additional range of internet enabled devices such as Smart TVs etc.
With Go Live!, a content creator will be able to upload content to our digital cloud and make it available to streamers that will access this content at a price. The solution is content creator-centric, and that means it is the answer in so many ways to the question, “How can we make Zambia’s entertainment industry profitable”.
We have four different types of streaming service categories that encompasses a majority of content produced in Zambia namely, Movies, Reality TV, Series and Concerts &amp; Live TV. We support creators of any of this content to create digital channels at no cost to them and start earning from it immediately.

Go Live! Makes it money in two ways:
1.	Advertising
2.	Commissions
Pricing
We have no standard pricing in order to allow the content creators to set their own prices for the content they create.
Prices will vary including that for:
•	Movies
•	Series
•	Reality TV
•	Live Broadcasts

> Technical Feasibility

Go Live! Is a product fully developed in Zambia by Weblogik Limited. We utilize other generic third-party services including storage and SDKs to enhance real-time engagements on our app. The application is made in three parts:
1.	Administrator Side – Web Based Application designed using Laravel
2.	Content Creator Side - Web Based Application designed using Laravel (In process of developing mobile applications for easy of use)
3.	Streamer Side – Web and Android
The Application uses a streaming service to provide the scale we need and the real-time capabilities without incurring a lot of server costs for Weblogik Limited. We are also using a cloud service to host all the content (We will need to upgrade to Amazon S3 once we have secured funding).
Our application is well laid out for the technical team to quickly perform tasks. We have also automated as many tasks as we can to ease the administration loads.
With enough funding, we will be able to create employment in sales and marketing, computer programming, content development and finance.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Go Live! is an early stage streaming startup located in Ndola on the Copperbelt. The main business is providing a platform for content creators and developers to upload content that is then served to end streamers. Streamers can access paid and free content and they can watch this at their own convenience. We assure our clients of the following services:
We provide a service for movie makers to upload movies on our cloud and make them available for Go Live! streamers to watch. The movie makers are given an incentive to:
i)	List the Main Cast/Artists of the content to create visibility for actors and musicians
ii)	List the content writers, directors and producers for their visibility
iii)	List content tags for search optimization
iv)	Upload trailers that can used to sell the content before release
v)	Add parental guidance control
vi)	Add an access price
vii)	Determine advertising (content providers can opt in to show external adverts for subsequent access by the same user to continue earning on their content. This is subject to revenue share between Weblogik Limited and the Content provider)
Beneficiaries are: actors, musicians, writers, producers, directors, vloggers, influencers. Media houses. And studios.
