> Description of the solution

Photocatalytic concrete pavements is to curb air pollution problem due to vehicle emissions. The past studies have shown that up to 35‚Äì40% of NOx concentration was reduced in the presence of photocatalytic concrete pavements.

> Socio-economic effects

Reduce a number of air contaminants such as NOx and VOC‚Äôs, especially at sites with a high level of pollution:

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- local government

> Timescale of implementation

- medium-term (2-4 years)

> Other Notes

Photocatalytic concrete is a special concrete, which possess photocatalytic property that can provide self-cleaning characteristics to the concrete. The photocatalytic concrete has the ability to reduce the concentration of harmful gases such as NOx.
