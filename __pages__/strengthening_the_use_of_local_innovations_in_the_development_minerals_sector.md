## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Development Minerals, Informality, Value Addition, Supply Chain Development

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Zambia’s development trajectory has been shaped mainly by mining, with the extraction of copper contributing to 70% of the country’s foreign exchange earnings and 14% of the GDP.  Without exception, the firms that have dominated the sector have been large-scale, mostly foreign with access to huge capital outlays and have focused on copper mining. Zambia is well endowed with a plethora of mineral deposits beyond copper, which have primarily been mined by Artisanal Small-Scale Miners (ASM). These principally include Development Minerals such as limestone, feldspar, salt, gypsum, granite, flat stones and clay, low grade gemstones – aquamarine, tourmaline and amethyst.  In contrast to the large-scale tradable minerals, the ASM sector and the Development Minerals sector in particular, have implications on sustainable development due to closer links with the local economy and have potential to generate more local jobs with greater impact on poverty reduction. The Development Minerals sector represents an important and growing part of the mining industry in Zambia that provides an opportunity to diversify away from over-dependence on one mineral commodity. Although the sector has the potential to depend on the locally produced equipment and tools which in turn could provide a sustainable domestic supply chain in the country’s construction and industrial sectors, most ASM rely on importing the equipment required for their operations and value addition.  As a result, this has led to barrier to entry and growth as most operations are subsistent and not viable leading to the adoption of poor mining practices which has ultimately led to many ASMs being stuck in a poverty trap.  Due to the lack of a proper mechanism in the sector for providing support to artisanal and small-scale miners, other challenges faced include lack of access to and inability to generate geological information; lack of technical and business know-how of the sector due to unavailability of capacity building opportunities; lack of information and access to market linkages including tax incentives; and lack of access to proper technology due to capital constraints. Therefore, addressing the constraints affecting the extractive sector would benefit local business enterprises, mining companies, government and the economy as a whole. At local business level, it would give rise to increased demand for local input production and supply. This would increase access to local business growth opportunities, trigger market-led capability, upgrade and increased access to capital, productivity, technology, and improve health, safety and environmental management practices. 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

We want to learn whether improving access to locally manufactured low-cost mining and mining processing equipment; (1.) Improves ASMs productivity (2) Improves ASMs output quality and standards (3) Reduces exposure to occupational hazards (4) Promotes female participation (5) Improves value addition to Development minerals thereby stimulating value chains

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development, ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme, Various Mining Associations
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The portfolio aims at identifying, developing, and growing solutions to support the participation of local artisans and innovators in the mineral value chain to support sustainable mining and value addition of development mineral resources and the use of environmentally sustainable mining practices that support the participation of women.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

We want to learn whether improving access to locally manufactured low-cost mining and mining processing equipment; (1.) Improves ASMs productivity (2) Improves ASMs output quality and standards (3) Reduces exposure to occupational hazards (4) Promotes female participation (5) Improves value addition to Development minerals thereby stimulating value chains

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group
