> Title of the innovation

Girl power

> Brief description of the innovation

I do farming, sell the maize. After raising some money I buy more maize then sell to sponsor my self for education.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I do farming and this helps me raise some money for my education and to put food on the table.
My business helps people very much, for example there are people who don't manage to buy a bag of meali meal, I sell them the maize in smaller affordable quantities for there meali meal.

> Technical Feasibility

I sell maize to people who can't manage to buy a full 50kg and to those who buy in bulk.
So my plan is to reduce hunger. If one can't manage to get a 25kg mealie meal then buy maize to make mealie meal. It is more affordable and the costs are manageable

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will help people who can't manage to get a bag of meali meal
Reduce hunger
Improve people's lives
For my education
Help put food on my table
