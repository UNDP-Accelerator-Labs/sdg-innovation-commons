> Title of the innovation

Biomass Charcoal Production

> Brief description of the innovation

A Charcoal making machine uses the process of Carbonization to convert biowaste material in the form of; coffee husk, olive shells, palm shells, bamboo, rice husks, sawdust, wood, plant stalk municipal sludge, river sludge, domestic sludge, domestic waste, industrial waste, and electronic waste into; charcoal, wood vinegar, tar, and combustible gas.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

the charcoal-making business is already generating ZMK 1.4 BILLION annually.  However intermittent power supply has caused the increase in charcoal and alternative fuel price, to solve this I propose using a low-cost efficient way to produce charcoal use biomass waste.  this venture will help the environment by reducing biomass degradation and population which are known to carry serious health hazards to both and water aquifers and recharge areas in urban and peri-urban cities of Zambia. and at the same time, this project will assist me in employing 10 uneducated youths and 5 others in addition who have not have gone on to pursue tertiary education in Zambia. 
 the value addition to customers is being able to buy the same product at a low cost,  to penetrate and dominate the charcoal and alternative energy market my fellow youth and I will use Michael porter's low cost generic strategic framework and drive down prices of all of charcoal and gas.

> Technical Feasibility

it has a cooling tower, dedusting settling pond, spray tower,  recycling water tank carbonization furnace, and airlock valves. 
which perform the following processes:

1. Carbonization process

Material→pass-through belt conveyor→closed feeding device→fall into the inner tank of high-temperature pyrolysis anaerobic carbonization machine (medium temperature zone)→fall into the high-temperature zone for high “temperature cracking, flue gas volatilization, sulfur release, carbon enrichment”, After the entire physical and chemical process → three-stage water-cooled discharge confidentially closed discharge

2. Flue gas combustible gas treatment process

A large amount of flue gas (combustible gas) is produced in the carbonization process → piped to the first-stage cyclone dust collector for dust removal → a flue gas after purification is converted into the combustible flue gas and then introduced into the auxiliary furnace as the heat source (the combustible flue gas is ignited with automatic ignition Exhaust gas after heat source utilization → cyclone dust collector dust removal → exhaust gas dust collector discharge

3. The anaerobic carbonization machine is a continuous drum production.

The initial temperature can be heated by coal, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, etc., and the feeding starts after the temperature reaches the carbonization temperature, continuous feeding, continuous discharging, and combustible smoke generated during the carbonization process The gas is used as fuel to the main furnace attached to the carbonization main engine as a heat source to heat the main furnace to reduce the fuel consumption of the main furnace. 
it only needs maintenance every 5 years

> Anticipated Social Impact

World Bank has projected a 2.93% population growth rate, meaning as a nation we can expect the population in Zambia to reach 20.4 million compared to the current 18.9 million. For the economy to grow and poverty to decreases, investments in Energy production both short term and long term are necessary. youth and government can play a cooperative role by sharing responsibility in this arena. government who have large sums of capital at their disposal can focus on long-term projects in the energy sector while youths can focus on short-term investment in the energy sector. biomass energy is an excellent and environmentally friendly way of producing energy.  the introduction of biomass charcoal-making machines will reduce the costs of charcoal and alternative energy thereby decreasing the financial burden of energy consumption in rural and peri-urban areas. 
the positive social externality from this is a higher disposable income in low-income earners. the increased disposable income will increase both consumption and investment which will facilitate a trickle-down effect improving economic growth and reduced poverty in Zambia.
it is a good were of using renewal plants and waste materials.
