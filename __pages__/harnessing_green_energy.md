> Title of the innovation

Harnessing Green energy

> Brief description of the innovation

Inverter circuit with solar buck-boost converter

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Load shedding has been with us for a long time and its not going anywhere just like the sun isn't too, We are on a mission to take advantage of this to help brige the loadshaded gap with free afordable energy, most importantly extend this project to the areas that have no power grid to tap from.

> Technical Feasibility

With support from interested parties this prototype project can be implemented in 60 days, mass production can be reduce hours with enough resources and man power.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The rural area's have no power sources but the sun is available for all to benefit from, not forgetting that the commercially available solar solutions are very expensive. Imagine a village with no zesco but have free green energy to pump water from wells, watch tv and lighting

> Name of the Innovator
