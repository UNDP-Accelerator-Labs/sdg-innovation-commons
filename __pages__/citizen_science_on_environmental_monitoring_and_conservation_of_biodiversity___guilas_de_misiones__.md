## Overall goal

Ascertain the population status of five species of large forest eagles present in the province of Misiones (harpy eagle, ornate hawk-eagle, black hawk-eagle, Philippine eagle, and black-and-white hawk-eagle) and contribute to their long-term conservation through participatory and active monitoring. 

 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens actively participate in the collection of data aimed at creating an “information network” that centralizes observations of the species of interest and, especially, their nests. Participating citizens are trained through in-person workshops in areas identified as key to the project. The purpose of these workshops is to inform the people involved about the project and determine new strategies for action or potential conflicts, so these can be addressed. The project encourages citizens to collaborate on monitoring marked specimens and participate in potential ecotourism initiatives associated with these species.
