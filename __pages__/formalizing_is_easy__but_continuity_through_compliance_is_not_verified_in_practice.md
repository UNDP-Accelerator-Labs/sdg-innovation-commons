## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Formalization is easy Cape Verde has very easy, fast and accessible formalization mechanisms. A company can be formalized in less than 1 hour and at a cost of less than 10 USD. The formalization is integrated with the social security service, automatically registering the company. There is the REMPE modality - Special Regime for Small and Medium Enterprises - which has very good fiscal facilities for small businessmen. The regime allows for the simplification of information gathering and tax payments, amounting to 4% on total revenues. The normal regime assumes 21% on revenues. 2. Complying with the formalities is complicated However, after formalization, the process of maintaining tax and social security compliance is difficult for already formalized small business owners. The physical services are very crowded, dispersed from the places where entrepreneurs are located, and the physical delivery of information is complicated for the literacy level of the public. Thus, they can quickly formalize, but the great majority stays at this first stage. 3. There is a need for greater proximity with entrepreneurs As said in the previous point, the physical distance from the tax and social security services, added to the difficulty encountered by the majority of the employees, presents a huge physical barrier to small entrepreneurs. It is necessary to break down these barriers for greater business success. 4. Literacy - Financial and digital literacy is critical to success The financial literacy of small business owners has proven to be one of the biggest barriers to enabling formalization and compliance. Tax and social security reporting services are already in place, but the level of literacy of entrepreneurs is either non-existent or very insufficient for the autonomy of these services. 5. There are several micro credit facilities available The government has several micro-credit services that allow helping the small businesses that were so affected by the pandemic. However, more than being formalized, these companies have to be in good standing. It has been identified that many companies are not able to apply for credits because of these situations. Even so, thousands of credits have already been granted, but the institution that grants them has felt unable to respond due to weak mechanisms for monitoring these fragile companies.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

When developing the 2 final solutions, the data we collected was, for the training, surveys to better understand what their main problems and needs were. We also conducted field interviews and user journeys for behavioral insights For the small credit monitoring system, we needed to collect data from different sources and partners to compose the profile of the customers and allow the management entity to monitor the credits. We use primary data and compose on secondary data.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The co-creating and the collective intelligence, allowed us, together with the business experts, to design the solution that will best raise us to achieve our goals. Instead of finalized and consolidated solutions, we opted for the design of a pilot project of a prototype to better test the solution before the final delivery to the beneficiary of the final solution.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Sucupira women's association

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

ProEmpresa

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Portfolio of inclusive growth 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The choice of topic was heavily influenced by the Global Team and the continuing internal discussions in the country office about the problem. After the choice, we went through a major learning phase, the experimental design underwent substantial changes to the point where we looked at the first concept note and had nothing to do with what was finally designed / realized. We can consider that there was continuous adaptation and adjustment through the learning process. As we conducted the survey based on our assumptions of understanding the sector, we refined it as we shared the information with the various partners. So today, we have arrived at two solutions that we believe will solve small-scale, but still large numbers of citizens/small business owners and change their lives. The final solution conceived has the logic of incrementation in the sense that with each attendance and likely result, we feed the main beneficiary institution and the laboratory itself with new imputes from the needs of the sector. Meanwhile, the conceived solution consolidates to be easily scalable.
