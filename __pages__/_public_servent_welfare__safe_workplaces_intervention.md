> Description

The performance of a worker in a company is closely linked to the commitment of their employer to make them feel satisfied with their work environment. We want to implement as a project a space of well-being for the officials of the institution, where they can find a monitor with images that congratulate them for their achievements through messages from the authorities or bosses, and images with motivating phrases for the official, where they can leave feedback on a tablet or box for complaints and suggestions. Also that it is a coworking space to socialize with other dependencies and there are amenities such as water, coffee, and once a week professionals from health fields such as nutrition, psychology, medicine, etc. appear. to develop healthy programs, Emphasis will be placed on mental health care with a research study on it. Another idea is that of a nursery in the institution for children of officials. Law 5508 and Regulatory Decree No. 7550/2017, on lactation rooms and nurseries oblige public institutions and public and private sector companies to implement them, but this does not really happen. Working Families points out in a study that employees who are parents and have a job that gives them a balance between their work life and their private life increase their sense of belonging and, for the most part, increase their productivity. Studies will be carried out to measure the impact of this solution.
