Bohomys is a social enterprise dedicated to using natural dye for textile dyeing. 
Textile dyeing is a contributor to one of the largest pollutions in the world. Bohomys is committed to reducing the use of toxic synthetic dye by exploring the traditional way of dyeing using plants that are sustainable to the Earth. The dyes are non-toxic, natural, and gentle to the skin. All products are special because they are hand-dyed.
Bohomys has a mission to empower youth by offering opportunities to them to up-skill, create and earn better. A part of their profits will be used to sponsor training classes for the youth to up-skill or upgrade their skills. Bohomys also offers them employment and business opportunity to create products for the enterprise, enabling them to earn better and use the experience for their entrepreneurship journey.

How do we recruit?
Why do we hire first? Because we want to show that we are serious about them. A lot of the youth feel demotivated when they need to go through months of training without getting any paid. The first thing that they need is to survive. So with this, we give them confidence that we are serious about them.
During this time too, we could analyse their strength and weakness and identify which part they could improve or what can they learn in order for them to earn.

Exploring 'tie-dye'
Tie-dye is a technique of tying the fabric before dipping or spraying it with dye, producing unique patterns. The dyes are made from natural products such as mulberry and mangosteen peel.
