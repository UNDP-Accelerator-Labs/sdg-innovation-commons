On the banks of the Rio Pongo, located a few kilometers from the city center of Kamsar, we discover before our eyes an idyllic scene with hyper-hurried ladies, men overloaded with basins at the edges of which we can identify the few lines of fish and seafood. It is in a good-natured atmosphere that we manage to collect a few words from our friend DAOUDA CAMARA fishing in deep water.

Like most of the unemployed young people of Kamsar, Daouda Camara found himself at a very critical moment in his life confronted with the fact of wanting to carve out a better future and at the same time provide his family with the minimum necessary for a living.
After his primary studies, Daouda was guided by the force of fate towards several types of odd jobs which ultimately remained without a favorable outcome. Always in search of a solution to his dilema, he quickly surrounded himself with a few friends who gave him the chance to enter their favorite exercise. This is how Daouda, a young resourceful man, will discover fishing boats, canoes and other traditional means of navigation at the heart of the port of Kamsar.

Our friend Daouda, day after day will end up enjoying it and will discover the wonders of fishing but also the constraints that go with it such as the level of coldness of the sea during the night, the difficulty of fishing and the scarcity of fish during the rainy seasons, very often the few losses of human life due to the sinking of boats of fortune.
According to Daouda, during his learning cycle, the biggest problem was the conservation of the fishing crops because, they had to quickly return to the surface to prevent the fish from rotting in the sea.
When the Senegalese fishermen arrived, Daouda and his friends had a chance to discover the "YOLI", a kind of traditional fishing boat made up of a very large canoe hull divided into several compartments including the 'front serving as a livewell hold, the middle serving as a transition between the front and the conservation hold. Speaking of conservation hold, here is one of the most innovative components of this traditional fishing boat because before its existence, fishermen like our friend Tinder beat each other up when they delayed at sea with the expiration of fish as an argument.

THE FAMOUS FLOATING freezer is a box whose walls are covered with glue based on liquid floats. In addition to this is added a cover made of polyester sleeping bag which finally makes the structure waterproof, allowing the fish to be kept this time for more than three weeks of duration on the sea. This makes the series of trips more than comfortable. Amadou and his family at sea. According to Amadou, after fishing, the contents of the boxes are distributed between them and the port manager in the following proportions: for each catch of three boxes, a half-box is intended for him. it will be remembered that in the event of an inconsistent setting, nothing is transmitted to him.

As it is often said, rural populations always have a solution to their problem.
From this solution of freezing over a long period, the fishermen act positively on the environment in the sense that they avoid letting empty bags inherit in nature which would probably push the residents to proceed with the calcination and thus pollute the environment. nature. For our Hero Daouda Camara, the conservation mode is more than beneficial since beyond the conservation of fish, without the need for a motor or battery; it offers them the possibility of reselling the residue of ice which is reusable to maintain the fish for the women going from the port to the various places of consumption or markets.


Thanks to Daouda CAMARA.
