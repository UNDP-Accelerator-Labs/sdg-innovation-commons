## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. We have observed that there is still a gap between the aspirations of local communities on the ground and existing government policies. Although the Nusantara Capital City Authority has made some efforts to increasing the capacity of the local communities, there is still a need to further involve them in the process and build a participatory approach to the city's planning and development.

2. The local residents would like to be more involved in the planning and development process of Nusantara Capital City. In particular, they would like enhanced communication with the relevant government bodies and certainty over their presence in Nusantara.

3. The existing local residents of the area on which Nusantara Capital City is being built aspire to have green public spaces that serve as a location for recreational activities. Green public spaces are relevant given that the Nusantara Capital City Authority aspire to build the city as a "forest city". In particular, many women in the community would like to have public facilities that are family-friendly as well.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

While implemented at a small scale, this project helped contribute to the signing of an MoU between UNDP and the Nusantara Capital City Authority, the principal government body in regards to the new capital, in March 2023. Other programmatic units within the CO have since begun exploring collaborations to support the city's development. Given the level of trust that was built through this process, UNDP, through the AccLab team, has been asked to support a Voluntary Local Review (VLR) of the SDGs for Nusantara Capital City in collaboration with the UN Resident Coordinator Office.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

In terms of data, Nusantara can be said to be a sandbox as existing data is used to speculate about what the future capital city will look like. The use of a public survey as well as rapid ethnography, workshops, and interviews provided insights on the aspirations of existing local residents as well as the nation's citizens alike, and paired with existing government policy,

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The use of anticipatory methods including foresight was indeed necessary because we are dealing with an urban area that does not yet exist. Thus, parts of the work are speculative and serve to build robust policies to address issues that may arise based on the identified trends on the ground. The use of participatory methods aims to close the gap between the aspirations of communities on the ground and the government policies of the future capital city. This gap has been a major concern surrounding the city's development and planning process.

The Nusantara Capital City Authority (OIKN) is a cabinet-level agency formed by the Government of Indonesia that works directly under the President. The agency is tasked with managing and governing the city of Nusantara, the future capital located in East Kalimantan. UNDP is currently maintaining active communication with OIKN to update project progress and gain feedback along the way. They have been involved with the planning of the foresight workshop as well as the report-writing process.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Our initiatives have helped to kickstart the participatory policymaking process in the new capital city. Overall, from the innovative methods we use we were able to learn and generate insights that are relevant and have served as a stepping stone for a establishing cooperation between the UN system (including UNDP) and a new government partner, the Nusantara Capital City Authority. In particular, this use of generative AI for urban planning is arguably the first of its kind in Indonesia.
