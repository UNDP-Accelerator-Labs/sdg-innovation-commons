## Title

Natural based solutions for compost and fodder
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that small-scale farmers and livestock owners are suffering from the increased prices of agricultural inputs, especially fodder and fertilizers which results in the worsening of the food security situation in Syria. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Food insecurities is a persistent theme in Syria due to the crises that the country has been going through for the past 10 years. Conflict, loss of livelihood, and reduced production capacities topped with economic sanction are all factors that led to drastically increase prices of food inputs which in return limited access to food and reduced purchasing power especially for the most vulnerable.   Small-scale farmers and livestock owners are the most affected by the increased prices and scarcity of Agri-inputs. They are forced to either reduce acreages they are planting, sell their livestock or produce only for their own consumption. This decline in production is contributing to the increased prices of food thus forcing families in vulnerable communities to reduce the quality and quantity of their food consumption. Unfortunately, the economic impacts of resource (compost and fodder) scarcity on welfare and food security are undermined.   On the other hand, we have identified through our solutions mapping efforts some positive deviants who are trying to overcome those challenges. There is a surge of nature-based solutions that are adopted by some farmers across Syria. Many farmers now are trying to address the scarcity of agricultural inputs and achieve self-sufficiency by going back to natural resources that are available within their environment. For example, for fertilizers they are composting and using food waste, vermicompost and manure. For fodder, farmers are using agriculture waste, sprouted barley and other nature-based resources. Moreover, some farmers are taking a step further and are trying to build simple agri-machinery that support the production process of compost and fodder. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Globally, according to FAO by 2050 we need to produce 60 percent more food to feed a world of 9.3 billion. On a local level. The food security situation deteriorated in Syria with the number of people facing acute food insecurity rising from 7.9 million in 2020 to a staggering 12.4 million (60 percent of the population) in 2021.

Many farmers from different Syrian rural areas are going back to nature based solutions to address the scarcity of food inputs. This present a great opportunity to boost these natural based solutions to be more sustainable.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

 On a local level, Accelerator lab will be working on the identified local solutions instead of working on imported solutions. We will build on, test, and develop those local solutions to ensure they are more sustainable. Accelerator lab will assist in testing the possibility of overcoming the sustainability gap by sourcing local materials to decrease transportation emissions and costs, and by cultivating solar energy to power the locally constructed Agri-machines.   On an individual farmer’s level, we will test how to create additional revenue streams to farmers by selling their extra production of fodder and compost using frugal entrepreneurship as a basis.   On community level, we want to test a community composting project on a small scale. Focusing specifically on vulnerable community members, women, trained on food waste composting skills. Through this project we can test the impact on enhancing local soils, supporting local food production, cutting amount of wasted food, and creating community development opportunities.  In later stages, UNDP can build on the final testing results and scale-up successful solutions

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

·         What are the current challenges that are facing smallholder farmers in producing their own livestock fodder and compost? ·         How are fodder and compost related to food security? ·         How can we support in overcoming the sustainability gap that exists in local solutions/Agri- machinery design? ·         What are the barriers that might face farmers if they decided to sell a portion of their fodder and compost production? How can we address those barriers? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are looking for positive deviant among farmers who despite going through same difficulties and challenges as other farmers chose to behave differently and create solutions that is nature friendly .
