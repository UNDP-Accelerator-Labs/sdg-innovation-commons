> Title of the innovation

Broiler Chickens

> Brief description of the innovation

Current business idea is to open a poultry company. Our idea is driven by high demand for broiler chickens due to very competitive prices when compared with other sources of animal proteins like beef, lamb, pork. The growth of the middle-income category in the Zambian population is driving this rise in the consumption of broiler chickens. 

However, imports of processed frozen chickens through the chain stores and traders are threatening the sustenance of the local industry.
 
We intend to operate in Lusaka the capital city of Zambia.  It has a population estimated at 3.3 million. Approximately 85 % of households eat chicken for protein. Currently, major suppliers of only save 55 % of households.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Long-life poultry farm will be a local producer of broiler chickens specifically for consumption. The business will compass keeping day old chicks and well matured to be sold out. 
Long-life poultry farm will use mechanized equipment’s, frequently veterinary checks, and good hygienic standards when processing birds for refrigeration.
 
Our target is formal and informal markets. Formal markets comprise chain retail outlets such as Shoprite, pick n Pay, and supermarkets like Melisa in Lusaka. Informal markets include open markets, cross border selling points such as Kasumbalesa border (DRC border). Our target audience are:
•	Households
•	Individuals
•	Hotels
•	Restaurants
•	Fast food eateries

> Technical Feasibility

We took time to prepare our business plan that will give us an operational guide. Other business tends to go with the wind and lack clear direction. We are a team of young people with passion for livestock. We love what we do. 
We intend to produce broiler chickens specifically for meat consumption. Our broiler chickens will reach slaughter weight between four and seven weeks of age. No hormone. Our chickens will have access to a special diet of high protein feed, relatively good infrastructure, and medication to mitigate diseases.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Long-life poultry farm will create Jobs to alleviate poverty in communities therefore contributing to Gross Domestic Product. It will create training and formulate networks with local and international professionals in the poultry industry to facilitate skills and knowledge transfer across Africa. Last but not the least the business will create room for internships to students studying animal sciences and related programs.
