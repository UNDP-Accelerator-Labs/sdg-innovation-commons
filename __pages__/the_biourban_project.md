> Type of the Solution

Technology

> Affected Sector

Urban development, environmental management

> Description of the solution

The BioUrban project, developed by the Mexican startup BiomiTech, features artificial trees that utilize microalgae to improve air quality in urban environments. These artificial trees are designed to perform the air-purifying functions of a small forest, making them especially suitable for densely populated cities where planting large numbers of real trees isn't feasible

> Socio-economic effects

Improves air quality, reduces pollution-related health risks, and enhances urban livability

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- private sector

> Timescale of implementation

- medium-term (2-4 years)

> Other Notes

The initiative is led by BiomiTech, 
a company focused on creating sustainable urban environmental solutions.
