> Title of the innovation

Low cost pig production for sustainable supply of pork and products and poverty eradication through employment provision

> Brief description of the innovation

This is called a low cost pig production because of the cost efficient structural design and construction for favourable growth of pigs.  The feed formulation are cost efficient but nutritious and fit for accelerated pig growth hence low cost of feeding. The use of saw dust in the piggery provides comfort to the pigs for a health growth and reduces smelling of the piggery  hence becoming environmental friendly. The whole piggery is to be constructed with locally available wood pole and flats stones which are relatively cheaper than the concrete flow and each room is to have a small pond for drinking water and cooling of the pigs to quench the desire of pigs being in mud hence keeping the pigs happy.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation shall generate income for me and others through the low cost production of pigs which shall give us two possible sources of income either to sale the piglets ar adult pigs which are raised at a low cost and sold at a higher price due to the current raise in demand. 
            As there is a rapid growth in the number of pork and products processing companies my innovation shall provide a consistent supply of raw pork for a continuation of production in these companies hence assist operations.
          My potential off takers of my products are not limited to THE REA MEAT, PORK MASTER, ZAMBEEF AND REGANA. My supply shall also catter for small business like butcheries and other pork traders. The challenge prize shall enable me to increase my existing stock and increasing production to meet the demand at reduced production time due to the availability of different production cycles at different stages of growth. 
          The most important value addition of the innovation on the environment is the odorless housing facility which is aided by the use of sawdust.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to increase productivity in the pig industry by  reducing the cost of construction of piggeries, the cost of feeding with cost efficient nutritious feed aimed at speeding up the rate of growth of pigs. The use of the sawdust is another new technique int the pig industry which makes the business environment friendly. 
          The existing prototype of the innovation is the current running piggery of six (6) pregnant pigs which are so far giving a very motivating performance and encouraging of extending the stock.
           The proposed implementation plan is the extension of the piggeries of which when the current pregnant sows give birth the current rooms shall not be enough for the piglets. The the second part of the implementation plan is the increasing of pigs which shall in return demand for an human labour.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation is a provision of reducing the cost of production but increasing the rate and size of production, once the rate and size of production increases this hence demands for human labour which in return becomes an employment opportunity and a livelihood changing.
         The innovation is very relevant to provide a consistent supply of pork and products  which shall reduce the cost of end products, the innovation shall enable the processing companies to continue operating to secure peoples employment and it shall open up new opportunities at the production farm
