Smart Artificial Intelligent Energy Management System

> Brief description of the innovation

The Intelligent AI Energy Management System for the future smart grids with distributed energy resources: 

1. Reduces the electricity demand load on the utility grid during daily peak demand periods, 
2. Supports renewable energy generation via distributed energy systems (DES) - wind turbine farms, solar Photovoltaic (PV) , concentrated solar power (CSP), and fuel cells stations, and
3. Combats intermittent energy sources that cause system reliability issues and result in high energy costs that organizations are forced to bear unnecessarily.

This Smart AI Energy Management System will optimize operating system performance using machine learning and data analytics within micro-grids to give organizations, cities and factories valuable insights by collecting real-time information on the organization's energy by monitoring, assessing, and visualizing energy consumption. This Intelligent Energy Management System is a Machine Learning and Data Analytics driven Intelligent Energy Cloud solution for smart buildings, farms and systems with organization-wide distributed energy resources, that will maximize the performance of organizations, cities and factories operational systems and reduce their overall electricity bill.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Improve Organizations' Business Operations - By eliminating waste and reducing overspending, JTI will be able to lower its operating costs. In turn, it will run its businesses more efficiently. In addition to lowering operating costs,  Organizations can save millions of dollars reducing energy costs by up to 35% - 40%  each year on utility bills alone. By using energy more efficiently and purposely, Organizations will see savings across the board. Organizations  can improve their business as a whole by developing organization-wide energy goals based on informed decision-making processes with the help of the Smart Energy Management System that acts as a Decision Support System (DSS). These strategic decisions will determine the financial future of the organization. 

For building occupants, increasing the intelligence of their Energy Management System will ensure that comfort is optimized and energy services are available when needed while energy costs are reduced thanks to reduced wastage. In addition, occupants interested in questions such as the sustainability of their building’s operations would have access to real-time data on information such as the carbon-intensity of the building’s energy supply.

Understand Organizations Power Factor - Your power factor helps you understand how much of the power you’re using to do productive work. All industrial processes that involve electric motors draw inefficient currents of power. A low power factor means that your utility company has to generate more power than required. Electricity companies charge you for this wasted power. By implementing an energy management system, Organizations  will be able to identify a low power factor and take the steps to improve it. This will reduce its energy costs significantly.

Remote and Centralized Control Of Systems - By adopting an Energy Management System, Organizations can eliminate the wasted time that is associated with controlling energy systems individually. Organizations  will be able to control its building/factory settings, schedules, and permissions from a central  system. When you put multiple systems into a single application, you’re able to make changes immediately across the board. This is a simpler, more efficient way to manage electricity. With a Smart AI Energy Management System, Organizations will have the ability to access its systems (across its various operation units) from any location or device, meaning you don’t have to be present at the office to be in control.

Information Is Power - An energy management system will provide Organizations  with invaluable data. Organizations will then understand their impact on the power grid and be able to determine which business operations use the most energy. 

Identify Room For Improvement - With this information, Organizations can prevent downtime by identifying areas of inefficiency and targeting them. Organizations will eliminate risks, ensuring the best outcomes across their energy portfolio, while tracking their progress to improve its profit margin. Organizations can then continually reduce their operating costs by monitoring and improving their energy management system, assess the quality of their power and build on its systems over time so that it always has the right amount of power when it is needed.

Cut Back On Organizations' Energy Consumption and Carbon Footprint - Reducing your energy usage is not just about saving money. Energy usage has a major impact on the environment. By using energy in a smarter way, Organizations  can rest assured that its business is “going green” and choosing to be socially responsible. Organizations can use this angle when marketing its business, which will be beneficial to its bottom line. If your business is more sustainable than competitors, it will make a big difference when attracting new customers. 

Automate Repetitive Tasks - Energy management systems will allow Organizations to save time on repetitive tasks. Computer-aided tools can monitor Organizations' energy consumption so that you don’t have to. They can be programmed to optimize their energy usage based on real-time conditions, eliminating the need to perform system check-ups. This will also help avoid deviation from intention, expectation or desirability that is often caused by human error.

Proactivity With Regards To Maintenance - If you’re proactive, you won’t have to worry about making adjustments down the road. An energy management system will help Organizations keep their equipment operating efficiently, allowing you to predict and prevent potential downtime and costly repairs. 

In the next 2 decades, 25% of all electricity will be generated from renewables, but managing renewables is a huge challenge.

THE VALUE ADDIDTION OF THIS INNOVATION ON THE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDE:
1.Reduced greenhouse-gas emissions
2. Reduced carbon footprint
3. Increased security of supply by reducing dependence on imported fuels


Our target market includes large corporations, factories, industries and utility service providers who spend millions in energy costs annually.

The challenge prize will help us develop a working prototype that we can then test on the market, pitch to potential investors and begin making communities and the environment more sustainable one organization at a time.

> Technical Feasibility

By using flexible algorithms that the Smart AI Energy Management System possesses, the system will be able to make autonomous decisions about the ideal energetic state of organizations' plant/building components. In order to minimize the effort of adding new plants and/or equipment in buildings, the developed algorithms are able to self-adapt to the respective plant/building configuration autonomously. As data on building energy use has increased, a wide variety of information is available to optimize Energy Management Systems so that they deliver energy services exactly when they are needed. Adequate energy management concepts derived from the Smart AI Energy Management System are needed that automatically shut down unutilized plant/building components and restart them in time for the next productive/occupancy phase. 

A practical example of this would be a building where hundreds of people gather in the main lobby every Tuesday at 9 a.m. With machine learning, the model starts to learn that this happens every week and prepares accordingly. Systems can decide before 9 a.m. to appropriately cool the space rather than take corrective measures after 9 when the temperature has elevated from the people gathering. Machine learning effectively looks at ‘when should we be aware of load increases on a building and how should we act and be proactive ahead of these load increases’.
