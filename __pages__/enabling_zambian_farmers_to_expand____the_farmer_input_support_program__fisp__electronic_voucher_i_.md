> Title of the innovation

Enabling Zambian Farmers To Expand.   The Farmer Input Support Program (FISP) Electronic Voucher initiative implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture during the 2015/2016 farming season, opened a window of opportunity for smallholder farmers to diversify their farming enterprises.  I have observed that the electronic voucher widened the choice of inputs for farmers engaged in both crops and livestock  implements.

> Brief description of the innovation

Electronic Voucher initiative will improve private sector participation.It has the potential to accelerate diversification of the smallholder sector by allowing farmers to purchase a wide range of recommended inputs such as veterinary drugs, agricultural equipment, livestock, poultry and fingerlings.

With the e-voucher, we are free to choose exactly the type of fertiliser and variety of seed to buy, unlike in the case where we have no option but to receive whatever is made available.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Farmers will be buying what they require. Those in livestock can purchase feed while others can get farming implements.
Farmers will be purchasing a wide range of recommended inputs and from this we will be making profits. Things such as veterinary drugs, agricultural equipment, livestock, poultry and fingerlings.

> Technical Feasibility

Information would be easily collected and the Zambian government would be able to verify the farmers data.
Farmers will submit their details directly  and  collect vouchers in a transparent and cost-effective manner without using other people in the process

> Anticipated Social Impact

More jobs people will be employed to work in the outlet offices. By doing this young men and women of Zambia will be taking care of themselves and their families. It will give birth to new businesses. They will start there new business and the country will grow.
