> Title of the innovation

Digital education

> Brief description of the innovation

Digital education system is the education of a modern man. It is the education for all and by modern technology with human touch. All learners will interact with educators using digital means. Assess, teaching and evaluations will be digital. It will be education on one's  finger tips on any location.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Because most of the lessons will be digital, limited space for offices will be required. Learners will pay for the services digitally and this will lead to growth of our organization. I got this idea from Coursera when I was pursuing a course in data science.All I needed was a device and internet connection. I letter applied it on Google work space and the idea is working perfectly with higher chances of growth. 
The target market are citizens rewriting or pursuing Zambian syllabus in junior secondary, high School and colleges. We further intend to include tuitions in international syllabus such as Cambridge and edexcel.
The prize will help us to purchase equipment to set up digital labs and rent of operation center for the first few months as we grow our customer base.

> Technical Feasibility

We are a group of three teachers teaching different  subjects. As we start in December, each member will take up 2 subjects and use personal gadgets. Our platform of teaching is google work space which provides free access for education institutions. We have further opened a page on Facebook and google my business. Our business name is Edutech School. It is currently appearing even on Google search and maps. In December 2021, we intend to rent an office in Lusaka to fully commission our operations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We will employ a number of teachers. Currently there are so many unemployed teachers waiting for government recruitments. In early 2022, we will employ a minimum of 5 teachers plus a security guard and an office assistant. Furthermore, we intend to have 3 more branches in Lusaka and one in kabwe. At the end of 3years we want our firm to be in all provincial heard quarters as we expand even in rural areas so that no one is left behind.
