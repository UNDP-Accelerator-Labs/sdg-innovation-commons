> Title of the innovation

Wastemat is leveraging on the use of 3D design systems to produce ecofriendly construction materials, and household assets and accessories using solid waste. It applies an innovative financing model targeting vulnerable communities using village banking where low income individuals can pool resources using saving cycles to purchase the products.

> Brief description of the innovation

Plastic is one of the most persistent pollutants in many countries around the world and Zambia is no exception. It's made to last - and it does, on average for 400 years or more. And at every step in its lifecycle, even long after it has been discarded, plastic creates greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change. Every year 8 million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans. According to a study published in the journal Science in August 2020, “if no action is taken, the amount of plastic that ends up in the sea each year will increase from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes. The international Labour Organization (ILO) SYB and WOIMA working paper notes that Lusaka alone generates over 2000 tons of waste per day, coupled with poor waste management systems it is usually discarded through burning which further increases CO2 emissions and often ends up in landfills thereby accelerating climate change, this has a direct impact on over six (6) million people. Plastikul Zambia in partnership with the Plastikul Consortium International is leveraging on the use of 3D design systems and micro mobile factory to produce ecofriendly construction materials, household assets and accessories using plastic waste.   Wastemat is leveraging on the use of 3D design systems to produce ecofriendly construction materials, and household assets and accessories using solid waste. It applies an innovative financing model targeting vulnerable communities using village banking where low income individuals can pool resources using saving cycles to purchase the products.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our expansion path involves working with local communities to scale the initiative, expand our product base and expand into new markets. We aim to use the revenues generated from sales into expanding our initiative to other major cities in the country. Our greatest measure of success is number of beneficiaries engaged, how many have sustainable income generating opportunities and the amount of C02 emissions managed, and reduced.The enterprise engages unemployed youths in Lusaka’s shanty compounds to produce ecofriendly construction materials such as pavers, air vents, e.t.c and house hold accessories such as chairs, desks for local markets and sanitary towels for women and girls. Our paying customers are the middle class, who are interested in ecofriendly construction materials and B2B organizations focused on women health.

> Technical Feasibility

We are using the latest advancements in 3D technology and agile mobile micro factories to make ecofriendly assets and construction materials for household consumptions as well as sustainably manage the environment. Through this WasteMat is able to sustainably contribute to reductions in land related pollution which releases carbon into the air, thereby leading to reductions in CO2 emissions. Our target through this project is to sustainably reduce up to 100 tons of waste from landfills and contribute to reducing of over 5000 kgs of CO2 emissions every month in Zambia.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Wastemat is a women led, women and girls focused enterprise aimed at improving the economic opportunities of vulnerable women, adolescent girls and youths. We promote women participation through improving public knowledge on women empowerment and promoting spaces conducive for women to thrive. The women also benefit through sustainable incomes, skills development and access to assets.We are targeting to reach over 1000 women, 2000 adolescent girls and over 1500 youths, we are currently producing up to 300 sanitary pads per week and able to reach 250 beneficiaries weekly, through our women tailors and we are currently producing pavers, ear rings, bins and household accessories. We are currently designing and employing our village banking targeting 2000 low-income women homeowners who cannot access traditional home improvement financing to have access to finance and sustainable build houses and have household assets.
