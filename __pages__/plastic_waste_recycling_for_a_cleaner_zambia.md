> Title of the innovation

Plastic waste recycling for a cleaner zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is related to the recycling of plastic waste in to building materials ie pavers bricks and poles for farm fencing LUSAKA produces tonnes of plastic waste daily and dump site around the city are almost full and plastic takes over 100years to decompose so waste will keep filling the city and causing problems... 
With my innovation it is possible to use plastic waste to make cheaper and stronger pavers and bricks at a low cost beacuse the input is almost free

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1.The plastic pavers and bricks will be sold at a cheaper price compared to the current market price of the materials 
2.the process of cleaning and sort is labour intensive so we will need to employ about 200 workers. Both men and women.
3.business will no longer need to pay huge waste management costs as my operation will collect plastic from them 
4.Plastic is major problem in zambia and around the world. My innovation will take plastic waste and use it hence a cleaner world

> Technical Feasibility

3 main materials needed 
1.Plastic (we have tonnes and more is produced daily 
2.waste cooking oil from take aways like hungry lion 
3. Building sand which we have all over the country 
4. Cleaning the plastic is straight forward, then plastic is to be cut into small pieces and mixed with oil and sand which is done by a machine it is heated and mixed then pushed into molds like pavers and bricks. 
Note. Plastic is does not break like concrete and wood.. it doesn't rot like wood

> Anticipated Social Impact

1.My innovation will take plastic of the street 
2. It will create jobs 
3. It will save the environment 
4. Because raw materials are cheap the price of the products will cheaper than market which means every Zambian can build something cheaper
