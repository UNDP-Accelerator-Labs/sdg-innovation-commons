> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Global waste production is one of the main contributors to global warming. In addition, soil pollution by means of fertilizers is another contributor because they degrade not only the land and the air but also the crops and the nutritional quality of individuals. Since half of the daily produced waste is organic, this solution promotes a model design that uses organic waste for the production of biogas and biofertilizers, and it can be replicated in different establishments that produce and sell agroecological fruits and vegetables.

The initiative suggests two lines of action to implement in the horticultural facility “De la Pacha”. The first one involves developing a biodigester—a hermetically sealed container—to be filled with organic waste and water, and then inoculated with methanogenic bacteria which decompose matter. The decomposition of organic matter within the container produces methane, which can be used as an electrical power source. The second line of action involves using digestates—the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion—as biofertilizers to improve soil quality and productivity.

This system is a solution that, through the first line of action (methane production in biodigesters), diminishes losses caused by product manipulation and reduces the consumption of gas cylinders . On the other hand, the second line of action (biofertilizer production and use) enables working with fertile soil, which contributes to crop resistance and health under adverse conditions, and minimizes the use of external supplies to offset food damage. The reduction of external supplies not only benefits crop quality but also blocks the release of gasses that harm the atmosphere.
