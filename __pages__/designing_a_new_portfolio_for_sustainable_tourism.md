## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Designing a new portfolio for sustainable tourism 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

With the current low performance of the tourism sector there is a strong need for a robust and resilience tourism offering to match the opportunity presented.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?




There is considerable evidence that even before Covid-19, Egypt has not maintained or extended its share of the global tourism market1. Some of this is likely to be because of a perceived narrowness of the tourism offering; a Red Sea market that has been mainly focused on the Russian and Eastern European markets, and a general image or concern among some tourists about safety and security. The War in Ukraine is impacting tourist inflows and growing food security concerns have potential to create instability in the region and create another dip in tourist arrivals. It therefore follows that a successful strategy will need to address all of these elements, as well as emergent trends in tourist demand dynamics.

Egypt is best characterized as a Low-Cost Mass Tourism Magnet. According to the IMF, the tourism industry employed 10 percent of the population and contributed to about 12 percent of GDP pre-pandemic. Egypt ranks first in Africa, fifth in MENA, and 51st globally in the travel and tourism development index (TTDI). It is a top performer in the MENA region with regards to environmental sustainability (31), natural and cultural resources (33), and business and cultural travel (22). With over 100 million in population, Egypt is both a prime destination for nature-based activities and a home to rich cultural diversity.

Despite being one of the top performers in the world on price competitiveness, it only ranks 3rd in the MENA region for tourism earnings. Safety and security concerns remain big issues as well, as the country ranks in the bottom half globally at 112.

While the pandemic has definitely been an accelerant, the combination of economic factors and new norms that underpin global tourism raise fundamental questions about long-term viability. Even as the global airline industry recovers from the pandemic, the costs of long-haul travel have become increasingly unaffordable – not only in the rising price of fuel but also in its contributions to climate change. The unexpected benefits of lockdown, improved environments and ecosystems, have countries questioning whether they want to return to the risky, crowded, over-reaching pre-pandemic world. And COVID-19 has magnified the vulnerability of local communities who already do not benefit from unsustainable tourism.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The complexity and multi-dimension of the challenge requires a system perspective and a system approach to the solution. This mindset coupled with portfolio skills is the unique value proposition that the Acclab is presenting. It has the capacity to find links and synergies beyond siloed programming that can contribute into one coherent portfolio.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Building a portfolio of a robust sustainable tourism offer for the world-renowned touristic destination, Egypt

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we transform Egypt's tourism model from mass-low cost to high value, while safeguarding the environment and ensuring benefits go back to local communities

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will be using system thinking and horizon scanning to map the system and understand context shapers. This will allow us to identify the problem space and levers for change. Then we will use sensemaking to amplify relevant existing assets in internal CO programming to further define leverage. Working with government partners and stakeholders will allow for participatory design and co-creation of the portfolio to facilitate future socialization and resource mobilization

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

identifying the narrative around tourism in Egypt. 
define how sustainability of the sector relates to other development contexts outside tourism traditional definition and where the opportunity lies
understand perspectives from different players in this multistakeholders system
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

tourism is a new area of interest for Egypt's CO new CPD (beyond existing ecotourism project)
there is a need voiced by the ministry to collaborate on renowned sustainable tourism model
there is increase in apetite for donors to strategic innovation, which can be a great venue to pitch portfolios
