## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Key words: Financial inclusion, women, digital inclusion, network.    - When designing public policies to improve women’s financial inclusion, social ties and community organizations should be acknowledged as key aspects to consider. Meal centers are particularly important since they have a strategic role to support communities. In those spaces, women  play  a leading role.     -Cellphones should be recognized as key tools in  women’s lives. It is the main technological feature (rather than computers, tablets, and the like). During the pandemic, it has become a working tool for many of them. So, public policies must be  designed towards this device and its user experience, taking into account the connectivity and storage limitations low-income  women may face. To meet these challenges, there has to be an intervention regarding connectivity infrastructure to guarantee internet access for all.     - While women have made -in many cases- a successful transition to digital channels (e.g. they develop informal and local groups to buy and sell their products or services, they start paying digitally, among other actions), there is still the need for territorial actions with in person support to favor a gradual digital transition, especially for older adults and people that are inexperienced with technology. Taking into account the difficulties of breaching the digital gap, that affect especially low-income groups, women and older adults, we designed an experiment on the possibilities of digital inclusion in through the provision of digital services by neighborhood commerces. The results of that experience, the Con Vos network, which was implemented in 31 shops in Concepción del Uruguay, Argentina, indicate that the most benefitted from the network were women, and people that did not have the resources or knowledge to perform digital procedures by themselves.The time women dedicate to unpaid work  (e.g. childcare, domestic chores, etc.) should be considered when designing any initiative, as this is a factor influencing their decisions, behavior and strategies. Accordingly, in order to promote women’s autonomy there must be an articulation to strengthen care infrastructure.    - Public policies need to be particularly adapted to this population of women from low-income neighborhoods, as they have their own experiences and challenges. However, diversity still exists within this group even when they share the vulnerable situation.

Implementation of Con Vos network : https://bit.ly/3GqFCR1  We are about to launch a publication which reflects this work (March 2022), accompanied by a social media campaign with key findings. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

When implementing the Con Vos network, which lasted three months in the experimental phase, we encountered difficulty gathering data on the usage of the network’s shops to carry out digital procedures, possibly due to the negative effects of circulation restrictions in context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

## 

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We worked with a non-representative sample, where cases were incorporated for their relevance to the research objective: map financial and early recovery solutions with gender perspective. There was a need for data to understand the needs, assessments, experiences and practices of women from low-income neighborhoods. This project was focused on recognizing these women as valuable sources to identify what could be useful to them and/or to improve their quality of life.  The experimental data was an necessary output of the learning activity and it was used to identify needs in the development of strategies to foster digital inclusion  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We conducted a remote fieldwork to collect data, especially through WhatsApp videocalls . There was a high level of acceptance from the interviewed women through this platform.  Additionally, the data collection was organized with an intersectional gender perspective, which refers to the effects that result when multiple axes converged:  economic, political, cultural, psychic, subjective, and experiential.   We conducted an experiment using an innovative design and working with Concepción del Uruguay’s local government, which was a new partner for us.  The pandemic forced fieldwork to be conducted remotely. Instead of being a limitation, this approach served as further proof of the widespread use of online platforms in low-income communities.  Working through this intersectional gender perspective allowed us to visualize a wide variety of life circumstances and types of household composition, both of which influence the solutions mapped. The pandemic also highlighted the network's potential and relevance in helping avoid crowds in customer service offices, decentralizing the offer of those services across the city. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In terms of data collection, we worked closely with a research group composed by members of the Universidad Nacional de las Artes.They were in charge of collecting data and writing a premilary report. The project leader had vast experience in qualitative methods with gender perspective. However, both the Argentina AccLab and the UNDP Argentina Gender Area, worked closely with this research group.  

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the National Ministry of Economy which has an area dedicated to gender issues. We discussed the strategy with them and proposed an online survey to collect data associated with local financial inclusion initiatives. We will reconnect with them in order to plan the launch of the report that reflects the solutions mapping experience and findings.   We worked with the local government of Concepción del Uruguay, that associated with us in the implementation of Con Vos network. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

For the first time, the National Ministry of Economy has an area that focuses on gender equality from an economic point of view. The local government of Concepción del Utuguay was also a new partner for us. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

This project was a collaboration with the Gender Area of the UNDP Office in Buenos Aires. We were equal partners for the entirety of the initiative: designing the initiative, doing the data gathering, mapping of the solutions, identifying patterns and producing recommendations.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Working with semi-structured interviews that were conducted online allowed us to gather the data in a way that also confirmed the information we collected. Due to the pandemic, the remote nature of the data collection process showed that the women interviewed were used to the digital devices as a tool for their daily lives.   We also conducted participatory workshops to discuss the mapped solutions regarding financial inclusion and socioeconomic recovery with the women who use and develop the solutions. They discussed them as specialists. Women talked about their potentialities, challenges, what works for them, etc.   The results of the implementation of Con Vos network helped us to gather insights on the importance of creating services and solutions that cater to people that do not have the skills, knowledge or resources to carry out essential digital procedures on their own, having a differential impacts in gender, age and level of education. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.

We will be soon posting our findings on the results of the implementation of Con Vos network in a blog post and a report.
