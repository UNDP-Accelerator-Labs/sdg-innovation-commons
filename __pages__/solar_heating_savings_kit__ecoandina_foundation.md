> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The Solar Heating Savings Kit has two pieces of equipment designed by professionals from the EcoAndina Foundation. On the one hand, it has a 100-liter solar collector for domestic hot water, called the “X-Sol 100” solar water heater, and on the other, a “Nina 120” parabolic solar cooker with capacity for a pot of up to 10 liters (8 servings). Both pieces of equipment have an estimated lifespan of 15 years.   It was established that the 20 families (from an urban area on the outskirts of the capitals of the provinces of Tucumán and Salta) should be in neighborhoods without natural gas network and in a vulnerable situation, since the purpose is to achieve savings for the families and avoid greenhouse gases emissions, as a result of the combustion of non-renewable energies (such as gas and firewood).

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Prototype system

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

The Solar Heating Savings Kit was distributed among 20 families in an urban area on the outskirts of the capitals of the provinces of Tucumán and Salta.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

With the solar equipment installed, the use of fossil energy for cooking and hygiene is reduced by up to 80%, according to the experiences obtained in rural areas by the EcoAndina Foundation.
