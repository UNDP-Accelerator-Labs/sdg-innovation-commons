> Description of the solution

Hanging Blackout curtains is one of the cheapest, easiest solutions imaginable. Blackout curtains are also known as ‚Äúthermal drapes‚Äù for a reason. They are ideal for blocking light and heat from windows that get strong sun. The best part is that contrary to popular belief, blackout curtains do not have to be black. They do not even have to be curtains. Blackout curtains can reduce the amount of heat which is transferred via the windows by as much as 24 percent, keeping the rooms cooler where they are installed and warmer in winter. This will allow efficient heating and cooling system and saving energy.
