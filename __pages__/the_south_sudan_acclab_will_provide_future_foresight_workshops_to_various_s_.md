## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

The South Sudan AccLab will provide Future Foresight analysis workshops to various stakeholders involved in the drafting of the countries National Development Strategy. The exercise will also be provided internally as the CO drafts a new CPD.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

A.      

Our challenge is the country has failed to develop within it's first 10 years of independence, it continually ranks the lowest on all development indices. The country is still reeling from the effects of prolonged wars and the National Development Strategy if created with foresight at the heart of it could avoid a potential other conflict.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

2021 marks the 10th year anniversary of the independence of South Sudan. The Republic of South Sudan joined the worldwide fraternity as the world’s youngest nation on July 11th amidst much fanfare and joyous celebrations attended by World leaders from around the world. On that day of independence there was much hope for what laid in the coming future but a decade on as we take stock, much of that hope and aspiration went unfulfilled with the country still reeling from the effects of 2 wars, a battle against a global pandemic, warnings of famine on the horizon as well as millions displaced, floods and the after effects of plagues of locusts.

Although the challenges have been immense 2021 gives the chance to mark the start of a new decade and for South Sudan to chart a pathway towards a brighter future. Towards this end the Government of South Sudan in fulfilment to Charter IV of the Revitalized Agreement for Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS). Has begun the review of the National Development Strategy. This process gives a unique chance for the peoples of South Sudan to actively participate in discussions about the country’s development strategy for the future. This process is being supported by UNDP as well as other partners and UNDP has made a commitment under the leadership of the countries UNDP Resident Representative, Dr. Samuel Doe “To continue supporting the development agenda of the people of South Sudan”.

At this juncture as the country’s peoples are engaged on discussions about the developmental strategy, we should take note that the country has experienced an environment of relative peace since the formation of the revitalized Government of National Unity. As well as hope with the start of distribution of the vaccine against the Covid 19 virus. Floods do persist but with peace communities are returning to their homes. All of these are signs to be hopeful and give the people a reason to hope for a better future.  

But the question remains, how do we help to chart a future that lives up to the aspirations of the people. UNDP’s South Sudan Accelerator lab proposes workshops engaging all stakeholders involved in drafting the NDS on futures and foresight analysis.

UNOCHA recently compiled an op-ed on 10 facts about a 10 year old South Sudan. In the blog it gives a damning reflection of the fragility the state finds itself currently in.

Chronic sporadic violence, extreme weather linked to the global climate crisis and the economic impact of COVID-19 have pushed more than 7 million people into severe food insecurity. This figure includes 108,000 people in hard-to-reach areas of six counties, who face catastrophic food insecurity between April and July. According to the Famine Review Committee’s report, Pibor was classified as "famine likely"

- Approximately 1.4 million South Sudanese children under age 5 are expected to be acutely malnourished in 2021.

- 2.8 million children across the country out of school

- Maternal mortality at 789 out of 100,000 child births, being the fifth worst in the world

- Limited access to water, poor road infrastructures, wide based flooding and lack of access to electricity across the country

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Currently UNDPs SPACE unit is supporting in the development of the NDS by gathering viewpoints on development from the varying actors across the country. However this process is more reflective rather than offering strategic foresight as well as centric analysis.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The South Sudan AccLab in support of UNDP's efforts to help the GOSS develop the NDS, will be offering future foresight analysis workshops to help see a better developed tomorrow.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We hope to be able to spark a mindstate shift in the Government of South Sudan from being reactive to be forward looking.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We shall use 6 functions to be able to deliver the exercise.

The first is to Inform policy this involves generating insights which relate to the dynamics of change, what future challenges may arise and what the options could be. This information is then transmitted to policy makers to feed into policy conceptualization and design.

The second is to Facilitate policy implementation this is delivered by enhancing the capacity for change within a given policy field and by building a greater common awareness of what the future challenges maybe and what the current situation is. New networks and visions are also shared amongst the different stakeholders.

The third is to Embed participation into the policy making this is delivered on by involving the general civil society into the policy making process, which gives more transparency to the process and a greater sense of transparency.

The fourth is to Support the policy definition, this stage will translate the outcomes from the collective process into specific options which can then be used for policy definition.

The fifth is to Reconfigure the policy system, this process will help to adapt the policy system to be more apt at addressing longer term challenges.

The sixth step will be a Symbolic function, the policies will be presented to the public to show that they were based on rational information using a structured approach.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is poor connection between Society and the Government. We hope through this exercise to be able to bridge that divide.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Government of South Sudan as custodians and responsible for delivering on development for the people of South Sudan
