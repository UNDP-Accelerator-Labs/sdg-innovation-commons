## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Working on ease of doing business for informal economy entities and workers across borders.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is finding an ease of doing business in African Trading Blocks for informal economy entities and workers when trading across borders.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

&nbsp;After taking in the Africa Borderlands Challenge with AccLab Zambia, the findings of the ABC report (2022) our geographical pairing showed that the engagement of formal structures by informal economy traders was expensive than using informal routes of trading goods across borders. There are also inconsistent use&nbsp; of trade regimes among countries under one trading block in Africa. If we work with neighbouring countries to resolve these issues then we can increase the ease of doing business in African Trade Blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The value that we give is the ability to experiment and have results that can be used by UNDP for future programming for Africa Borderlands Centre and AFcFTA. If this was to be using a programme unit it would have required a project document and responsible partner which have taken alot of time and administration.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Zimbabwe Accelerator Lab is learning and exploring ways to improve the ease of doing business across borders for informal economy entities and workers. We need to identify the barriers and map solutions to overcome the challenges encountered.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we improve the ease of doing business for informal economy entities and workers under trade across borders. We need to understand the challenges and barriers of trade across border and the possible solutions.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnography: community immersion field missions will be held in the border communities we are working with
Pilot: A border will be identified to pilot the work with the border identified
Proof of concept: The solutions identified will be tested to see if they are effective in solving the challenges in the border community where the pilot is being done.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Financial transaction data: there is a lack of information on how people transact financial transactions. This will assist in understanding where their highest expenses are for doing business and how we can mitigate them
Ethnographic data: This will assist in understanding how to work in the experiment with the target group for the pilot in the identified border community.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The AFcFTA Regional Office will benefit from this as they are trying to popularise AFcFTA and to improve trade in Africa
