> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

In case of the fixed stationary PV systems, we can't reach to the appropriate functionality at the early morning, and the afternoon time, unless we increase the sizing of the system. (Oversizing design). Solution: A PV system with a manual sun tracking mechanism was done to increase the generated power specially in the winter season.

The manual tracker consists of a metal frame where the PV is attached to and the farmer can manually move the frame to the direction of the sun throughout the day
