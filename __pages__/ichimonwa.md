> Title of the innovation

Ichimonwa

> Brief description of the innovation

This program seeks to empower myself and many women and young people from our community. It is mainly involved in farming and sale of the farming produce. It is a way of employing many unemployed people in our community.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This program will be able to generate funds from the sale of farming produce. For example at the moment I am currently selling eggs. With enough capital I will be able to have my own layers and will also be making my own feed in order to maximize profit margin, This will in turn create employment opportunities to both the women and young people. The chicken waste will be applied in the field and increase the fertility of the soil. In the field we can plant different kinds of plants and these can be helpful in reducing climate change.

> Technical Feasibility

We are of the view that in the near future we can also include other trees.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This can improve the lives of others because of the amount of money every one will be able to get. Many people will no longer be living in poverty because they will have an income. From the program many will have experience in dealing with a number of things which they be exposed to. And this in turn will help all of us  be able to do a lot of things like paying school fees for the children and many more.
