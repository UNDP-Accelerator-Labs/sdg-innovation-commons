> Brief description of the innovation

Solar tent dryer:The farming Economic powering-FECOPOWER,is a multipurpose solar drying facility made of 50 micron transparent plastic, wooden poles,knotless webbing,zip and meshwire put on planks as drying racks inside. It is used to dehydrate(solar drying) anything fresh e.g vegetables,fish,maize and mash rooms while preserving the original form.
The dryed foods are packed, preserved and branded for sale as dry food.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With the solar tent dryer, I will be producing all types of vegetables and buy from other farmers e.g chibwabwa,lumanda,bondwe etc during dry season and solar dry them. During rain season no vegetables will be left to waste including mashrums all shall be solar dryed properly packaged, branded &amp; supply for sale. Superstores, public markets, local restaurants,homes and lodges shall be targeted as my markets. The challenge prize will  grow my business by purchasing irrigation equipment for vegetable production, establishment of big solar tent dryers to maximize production,set up packagings and branding and marketing/Advertising/supply. With Solar tent dryer, there will be less vegetables dumped to rot in the market places,EG, mashrums in rainseason, and tomatoes &amp; other vegetables this is value addition to the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Solar tent dryer will be like a square 4m x 6m x 2m(W x L x H) build with wooden poles, the frame is covered with a 50 micron transparent plastic all round, knitted by a knotless webbing, fitted with drying racks inside of planks and meshwire and secured with a zip on the door with no windows. the prototype is in triangle form but same technology.
Proposed implementation plan includes Sourcing of funds by myself for the acquisition of the 50 micron transparent plastic (1 Roll), wire nails,coverstrips, knotless webbing,zip wooden poles, planks and meshwire.labor. Also wire fence, irrigation equipment and packaging materials for dryed foods, branding, advertising and supply at the total cost of k35 620.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Solar tent dryer has the capacity to improve people's lives in the following areas:
# Less worries by vegetable farmers  from loosing there fresh vegetables E.G chibwabwa, bondwe,rape, tomatoes,mashrums and kalembula etc,due to perishing when not bought by  fresh vegetable traders and consumers.
# Vegetable farmers will produce more vegetables knowing it will be  supplied to the solar tent dryer for solar drying, processing, package and branding.
# Job creation. Solar tent dryer will require operators.
# Economic powering to vegetable farmers,dry food traders and workers.
# Support to good nutrition
Innovations relevance: There are more fresh vegetables and foods/ fresh fish that go to waste (perishing) due to lack of reliable ways of preserving them without spoiling the original form. The solar tent dryer seeks to solve that problem and add more value to the vegetable and fresh foods value chain.
