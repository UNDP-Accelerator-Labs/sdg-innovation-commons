This innovation is so supportive to other existing business as it favour them very much for instance transport business through ferrying of produce to the market and paultry farmers where I buy manure. Not only this it also support those marketeers who sell at the markets and prevent them from travelling to Tunduma ( Tanzania) to go and but these produce. And  once expanded it will also support schools, Churches, Hospitals and universities in Chinsali who are my mainly targeted markets.
In order to expand this innovation and generates more income, the price of the produce will be slightly lower than on the market and other things is to produce quality products.
