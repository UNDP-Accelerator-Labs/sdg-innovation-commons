## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Establishing a Blockchain-powered Traceability System for Indian Spices
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

How new and emerging technologies such as blockchain can enhance transparency, traceability and accountability in spices value chain in India and contribute to increased income for farmers?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

India is the world’s fifth-largest economy with a total GDP of USD $2.94 trillion and expected to become the world’s third largest economy by 2025. India has halved the incidence of multidimensional poverty by lifting 271 million from the most vulnerable sections of society out of poverty during 2005-2016. In the “decade of action” towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (2020-2030), the country is facing challenges like rising intra-regional inequalities, with higher concentrations of poor in rural India, and threats posed by climate change to livelihoods.   In this context, UNDP India’s Strategic Plan has been designed to be responsive to three urgent priorities of India namely: eradicating poverty; structural transformations; and building resilience. As part of the “building resilience” work programme of UNDP India, the Accelerator lab is currently working on the focal areas of Climate Resilient Livelihoods and Air Pollution.   Under the Climate Resilient Livelihoods theme, the lab is striving to enhance the resilience of small-holder farmer which is an important national priority.    The Specific Challenge Statement: How to ensure equitable returns to spice growing farmers of India?   India is the largest producer (and consumer) of spices in the world- with export value worth USD $ 3 billion every year. One of the major challenges that small farmers face is getting their “fair” share of income. This is due to difficulty in assuring quality at every stage of the value chain and presence of large number of middle-men who take major share of profits from exports[1]. This is further aggravated during the current covid pandemic when the agriculture supply chains are strained, less transparent and working sub-optimally during this period. The application of blockchain technology to enable traceability across the agricultural value chain is a plausible solution which the Lab is seeking to explore.

India has more than 140 million families (approx. 700 million persons or 52% of total population) dependent on agriculture, 80% of these are small farmers with less than 2 hectares of land.  Resilience of small farmers in India is important from the context of multiple sustainable development goals - Climate Action, Zero Poverty, Zero Hunger and Partnerships. India is the largest producer (and consumer) of spices in the world- with export value worth USD $ 3 billion every year. The domestic consumption of spices in India is also over 1 billion dollars annually.  One of the major challenges that small farmers face is getting their “fair” share of income. This is due to difficulty in assuring quality at every stage of the value chain and presence of large number of middle-men who take major share of profits from exports. This is further aggravated during the current covid pandemic when the agriculture supply chains are strained, less transparent and working sub-optimally during this period. The application of blockchain technology to enable traceability across the agricultural value chain is a plausible solution which the Lab is seeking to explore.

The Secretary of Spices Board India in his recent statement mentioned that the changing order in the global spices and food sector has increased the relevance of infrastructure development for value addition, certification for quality and food safety, promotion of spices highlighting the immunity boosting properties, etc. There is a need to make the spices value chain efficient, transparent and equitable for all stakeholders and leveraging technology is key to achieve this outcome.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Given the development challenge of traceability in agriculture commodities, our lab intends to co-design and implement a farmer-centric, transparent and robust blockchain platform for Indian spices, while leveraging existing systems and technologies available among our development partners. We expand on this more in the following section as well.   Through this development challenge our lab will address the following learning questions: 1. What incentive structures and systems work better for farmers’ adoption of blockchain platform? 2. What is the value addition of blockchain platform in terms of: (a)Reducing food adulteration of spices -          Improving export potential of spices  (b) Enhancing small farmer’s income  (c) Enhancing transparency and accountability across all stakeholders in the value chain  2.  What is the potential to scale-out the blockchain initiative to new commodities and geographies?  3. What is return on investment of blockchain platform?

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are building India's First-of-its kind blockchain-powered traceability system for Indian spices to make the spices value chain transparent, equitable and profitable.

UNDP Accelerator Lab is partnering with Spices Board India for this challenge. Spices Board is one of the five Commodity Boards functioning under the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. It is an autonomous body responsible for the export promotion of the 52 scheduled spices and development of Cardamom (Small & Large). The main Functions of the Spices Board are the following: (i) Research, Development and Regulation of domestic marketing of Small & Large Cardamom; (ii) Post-harvest improvement of all spices; (iii) Promotion of organic production, processing and certification of spices; (iv) Development of spices in the North East; (v) regulation of quality of spices for exports through its quality evaluation services; (vi) Export promotion of all spices through support for technology upgradation, quality upgradation, brand promotion, research & product development. Both UNDP and Spices Board entered into a partnership to build a blockchain based traceability interface for Indian spices to enhance transparency and accountability in spices processing and trading.
