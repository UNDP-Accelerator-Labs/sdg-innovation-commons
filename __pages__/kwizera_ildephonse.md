No

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

- Fuzzy logic based real time data acquisition of Solar system - This solution is aimed at improving efficiency of solar energy and security of solar system infrastructure. Monitoring system and prediction of photo-voltaic energy generation helps to reduce the energy loss and utilize more energy. Solar energy prediction is inspiring as it depends on the changing solar radiations and climate conditions.
