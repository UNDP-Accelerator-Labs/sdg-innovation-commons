> Description of the solution

Firewood used to produce as much as 94 per cent of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in some Chilean cities. In 2014, the Government launched a programme in the centre-south region to replace 200,000 firewood heaters with more energy-efficient heaters such as new gas, paraffin or wood pellet-based heaters. This resulted in a reduction in emissions and improved indoor air quality.
