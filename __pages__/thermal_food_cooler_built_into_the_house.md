> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Experts built a passive thermal device to preserve food, and installed it in a rural household in the suburbs of Bariloche. The house is made of wood and it has thermal insulated double walls in mud and straw. It is plugged to the grid but with limited electrical power, therefore it has sought a reduction in electric consumption. The cooler has wooden structure and insulated walls of expanded polystyrene. The heat is transferred to the cold exterior through a metal surface, which can also be insulated on and off by an external door. The mounting of the device was finished and sealed with mud and straw to match the house´s architecture.

The device was built and installed in the house in January 2009 and was systematically tested between March and August of the same year. The results show a great potential for passive cooling in Bariloche, Río Negro, Argentina, for at least 6 months of the year. Starting in May, and estimated until the end of September, the cooler can be considered a very similar alternative to a regular refrigerator, and the period of use can be extended for two more months by adapting the storage of food to average temperatures of about 10°C.
