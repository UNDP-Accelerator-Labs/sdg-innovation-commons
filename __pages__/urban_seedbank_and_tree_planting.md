AIDC is an environmental NGO based in Luanda. Volunteers collect seeds from old trees in the city centre and plant new trees to create shade and improve the urban environment. They also produce their own compost from collected and donated organic waste, which has promoted a new habit for sorting organic waste within the neighbourhood.​
