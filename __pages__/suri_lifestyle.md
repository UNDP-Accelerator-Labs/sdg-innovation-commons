SURI is a Malaysian social enterprise that aims to empower underprivileged mothers by providing financial opportunity and living skill of sewing. All of the beneficiaries undergo a 3-month training of creative sewing to ensure quality of products under the brand SURI Lifestyle. Currently, 40 mothers work on full- or part-time basis with SURI. 
Objectives
To give mothers a long-term, reliable source of income. This creates a social impact beyond just supporting themselves and their families, giving the mothers a way to develop their personal growth and self reliance.
We are committed to help these mothers to become more productive and resourceful in order to be the best parent they can be for their children.
We educate and equip these mothers with resources, assistance, encouragement, training and networking in order for them to live a successful and productive lives.
We will continue to make a difference in the lives of the mothers and their families in the years to come.
We aim to erase the mindset of charitable offerings to these mothers, but instead we are geared towards income based plan through employment support program. As they work and earn a living it will leave an impact of growth and personal improvement to them and their children.

All products sold are made from unwanted used denim that have been washed and treated before being made into products. All designs and products are created by the mothers, and the profits from the sale will be given to them. Products include bags, footwear, household accessories, and wearables. 
Thus far, SURI Lifestyle has helped 40 mothers, recycled 5,496kg of fabric materials, and produced 38,982 pieces of products.
