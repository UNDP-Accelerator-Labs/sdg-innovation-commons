## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Civic networks, crisis response and public service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that given the COVID-19 pandemic, public services delivery in a business-as-usual manner is no longer sufficient; innovative methods are required to provide assistance in this time of crisis. The case of COVID-19 response in Thailand has demonstrated the criticality of whole-of-society approach in developing social innovation for effective crisis response and recovery.


> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

While the Thai government has launched a series of public health and socio-economic measures to support its citizens, the private sector, academia, and civic networks also play an important role in combatting the pandemic and assisting vulnerable groups throughout the crisis. It truly takes all of us, individuals from all walks of life as well as large institutions from all sectors, to overcome the crisis and move forward stronger. One can argue that the way we work together can be in itself a form of social innovation. Fostering civic engagement and leveraging the expertise and resources of every sector of the society can be our pathway towards a more resilient future. During the past 2 years, we have witnessed an unprecedented level of expansion in the engagement by civic networks and their growing contribution in overcoming the crisis. With an insider perspective of the affected populations, civic networks help to close the gaps by applying innovative and human-centered approaches to public services delivery. They are a result of collective efforts by both existing and newborn groups which form an expanding ecosystem of civic movements.
