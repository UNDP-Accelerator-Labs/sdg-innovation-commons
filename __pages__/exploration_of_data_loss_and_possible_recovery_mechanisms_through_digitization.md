## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) The Accelerator Lab singled out the data element for exploration to understand the extent of data loss, and possible recovery mechanisms and devise a resilient data handling system in the future at the lower government structures that have been affected by the war in northern Ethiopia (Lasta woreda and Lalibela city administration). Our exploration mission uncovered major destruction to the data in all respective governmental offices but with different extents of loss from intentional destruction such as robbery to the collateral damage of government offices which result from the war, where aggressors intentionally destroyed or looted equipment such as computers that stored the data.  The two offices which experienced a high level of data loss due to burning were The Justice and Prosecutor’s Office and the district civil service office which lost 100 % of their data. But we have seen an office like the Bureau of Finance and Economic Cooperation (BOFEC) is minimal because the office uses a system called IBEX (Integrated Budgeting and Expenditure) which captures the data online and regional information was able to use backup for the past 10 years despite the loss of hard copy.   This gives us an insight into how digitization can recover data loss despite future potential shocks. 

 

2) As a result of the data loss, most government functions in the woreda have been partly or fully disrupted. This has brought frustrations to government officers and experts as their routine way of doing have become cumbersome due to lost data or messed archived evidence, which made traceability of documentation an extreme challenge. On the other hand, the service recipient community is dissatisfied as they have received an income service or returned without getting the right service. Among many problems, loss of prosecution-related documents, land-related agreements and titles, enterprise sales and financial documents, and human resource personal files have critically affected government business. This has impacted access to justice, poor area-based security analysis, improper revenue collection, and unfulfilled rights of employees for promotions based on performances on personal files, etc.   

3) The challenges faced by government offices are twofold. There are challenges in data loss related to internal capacities of the offices such as lack of technical capability and systems to manage data, but also, there are external challenges such as intentional damages to data using the opportunity that was presented by the instability. The existing data management systems differ from office to office. There are purely paper-based data in the case of the Justice Office of the woreda, a hybrid system in the revenue and trade office to fully digital backup in the Bureau of Finance. The varying degree of data management systems created vulnerabilities for offices that are lagging in digitization. It not only creates challenges in data management but also in providing better services to citizens and exchanging information between offices.  

4) On analyzing the gaps, we have seen that the absence of regulation on data management has put government employees to refrain from removing computers’ hard discs to make data recovery possible. Therefore, emergency data protection protocols, both the technical and legal aspects of ICT were found to be missing areas. Though it might be difficult to have a fireproofed warehousing system due to technical and economic reasons, documentation storage made from concrete materials would have reduced the risk of fire damage. Also, data criticality analysis and categorization for safe archiving and backup of the most important data seemed undermined, which ultimately brought devastation to government service provisions (under the civil service) and the regular development work.  Therefore, lack of technical skills in ICT management, scarcity of qualified experts on data management, timely backups and safe physical data storage, poor emergency early warning systems, and poor data evacuation plan, are the critical gaps observed in Lasta Woreda and Lalibela city administration. We have observed that the lack of basic skills in the removal of computers’ hard discs during such war emergency situations has jeopardized the possibility of data recovery.  Also, digital operations are merely practiced throughout service delivery workflows because it is constrained by the community’s low level of digital literacy.    

5) Since this exploratory mission required to be integrated with the Amhara recovery interventions and contribute to the overall goal of the project, we have designed possible data recovery, short-term, and long-term solutions for resilient data management systems, data regeneration, or fetching new data in the targeted locations. Generally, in addition to the recommended summary of solutions by each prioritized sector office, digitization is one of the suggested ways forward to connect the system with a cloud server safely located away from the intervention area and to get the data stored in the system used for development analytics. The data will be used not only to satisfy customers and digitally archive data, but also could be utilized as a big data input for development analytics and programming in the targeted area

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- On the exploration process, the institution is more focused on identifying socioeconomic and psychosocial aspects of losses and not gonging data loss as a priority even if it has a significant impact on a sectoral day-to-day business implementation. Cognizant of the fact that introducing complete infrastructural support to revive government business might not be successful if essential data are recovered to run government services and decisions.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- In the exploration process the lab team developed a discussion guide was prepared to engage different government sub-offices at Lasta Woreda, and Lalibela city administrations. We have conducted interactive discussions with each selected office using a focus group, direct interviews, and In-depth interviews methodologies to assess what data has been lost, the extent of loss, adaptation strategies followed to revive the normal government functions, IT-related expertise profiles, and existing capacities, how does the loss impact both the government and the service recipient community, suggested local solutions under their context, etc. 

 

- Through Literature review and grey documents analysis expert opinions were drawn to understand the overall data loss and what resources it may take for recovery actions and long-term resilient data management systems and capacity-building areas to fill the existing ICT and data management skill gaps within, or inter-government offices were pointed out.   

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- The lab used horizon scanning and sensemaking to scan the weak signals and the trends that the office uses to recover and regenerate the data that they lost due to the war. This enables us to captured data and to structure field report through brainstorming based on the preset solutions design principles. 

- Through participatory design we were able to define what resources (time, budget, and human capacity) it takes to solve data related problems in the short and long terms for experimentation and scaling.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

- Using unusual data sources as well as bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight within a short period of time in different topics as well-diversified learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implemented in a previous implementation form. It enables us to see different insights which we didn’t see in the normal project implementation ways. It also enables us to use fewer resources since we have done many activities through collaboration with other partners which makes the lab approach less resource incentive method.
