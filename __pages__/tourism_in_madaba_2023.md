## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Tourism in Madaba 2023


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that tourism products in Madaba are not attractive enough to improve tourism revenues in the governorate.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Madaba receives the second-highest number of international tourists visiting Jordan and the lowest number of local tourists. International tourists pass through Madaba and do not spend the night; local tourists do not visit it. International tourists do not have enough activities to engage in during the evening. Hence, they prefer to sleep in other locations. Domestic tourism is relatively expensive, and there is not enough marketing to visit Madaba, and also the activities packaging is not attractive enough for the different local tourist personas. 



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to the Ministry of Tourism in Jordan, in 2019, Madaba received the second-highest number of tourists (along with Jerash), around 467K  out of 4.5 million visitors who spent at least one night in Jordan. Comparatively, Petra received 1.1 million visitors in the same year. Madaba's central location should encourage more visitors to include it in their itinerary. It is close to the capital Amman, to the Dead Sea, which is also a popular tourist destination. In 2019 and 2021, Madaba was the least-visited destination by local tourists, with less than 1500 people. These are examples of the pressing need and an excellent opportunity to explore how to improve tourism projects in Madaba to create more work and self-reliance for its residents.

Madaba was named the Arab Tourism Capital for 2022 by the Arab Tourism Organisation. In April 2022, a Member of the Jordanian Parliament approached the Resident Representative seeking support to improve tourism in Madaba. The team ran several activities that generated qualitative information such as international travelllers' personas, impressions of domestic tourism through radio mining, and ideas for interventions co-ideated with stakeholders. 

We completed a sentiment analysis of TripAdvisor and several immersion trips. 

The trends noticed were: 

Madaba is the least visited site by local tourists. 

Petra is the most visited by all tourists. 

Arab tourists are the highest number of tourists visiting Jordan.  

Alternative tourism in Madaba is overlooked, as tourist guides and offices are comfortable with traditional tours.  

Local guides in Madaba have the challenge of licensing, which is expensive and requires language skills. 

Cooperation is not noted between the tourist and local guides.  

Tourists are interested in stories related to historical sites.  

Madaba is missing from the UNDSS Jordan Hotel List, which lists hotels in different locations and categorizes them based on level of safety. UN staff must use only hotels in this list that UNDSS approves, or a security assessment must be done for any hotel not approved.  

Tourism products and experiences throughout Jordan do not "wow" visitors or go above and beyond to impress. 

They often resort to duplication, kitsch, and average or below-average quality.  

Tourism products and experiences are often overpriced.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab dedicated its resources to exploring, mapping, and experimenting with knowledge and solutions that could improve tourism in Madaba while creating income for the local community. Our added value is in the conventional and unconventional methods we use to produce learning. We can absorb the learning on these themes without disrupting the daily work of the other pillars or partners. We were also cost-efficient as we used a modest budget to run several activities to ensure diversity of knowledge.



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In 2022 the Lab built relationships with officials and local community members invested in improving tourism in Madaba. Now there is a big interest in running more experiments in the governorate.

They are a grassroots solution. We work with them on an experiment of the open-air exhibition on intangible cultural heritage. 

The non-profit company will measure how this exhibition would improve tourist night activities by offering a self-guided tour around the city.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Core question: how can we create tourism products to increase revenue for the governorate? 

Subquestions: Who is already working on tourism in the Madaba governorate? What are they doing at both grassroots and institutional efforts? What experiments can the Accelerator Lab test with grassroots solutions to improve tourism in Madaba? How can we monetise tourism products to become profitable? How can we scale the products in other cities in Jordan?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Working with the local community and officials through participatory design will increase their ownership of the final solutions and ensure that these products can be managed with the available resources. 

Prototyping will help us test for usability and desirability with low resources before launching products at scale. Prototyping is not commonly used within the organisations and groups we meet with. Therefore, to see that they are starting to speak the language of small test scaling is brilliant.



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Understanding the personas and their user journey is a good tool for identifying opportunities to design and run additional experiments. The experiments of tourism products would be tailored according to these personas.

The experiment with the open-air exhibition attracted the interest of several government bodies and officials. They liked that it was an experiment with the potential to improve the experience afterwards. The experiment shows the importance of running prototypes before launching a project at scale. We are gaining many insights on how to improve the final product. 

An important question that we will explore and are still unsure about the source of data about it is how to monetise the products in profitably. 


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

There are two pathways to grow the work in Madaba; the first is to take the knowledge product mentioned above to the government, donor agencies, and the private sector to see what and how they can use these learnings.  The second pathway is to replicate this pilot in other governorates in Jordan. UNDP Jordan colleagues have had conversations with municipalities in other parts of Jordan eager to improve tourism and for UNDP to help.
