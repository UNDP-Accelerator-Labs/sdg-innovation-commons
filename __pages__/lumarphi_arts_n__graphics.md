Lumarphi Arts N' Graphics a business name registered under PACRA an Initiative started by Mr. Luyando Phiri with an intention to cooperate and coordinate with various Artists as well as graphics designers to empower and train more youths in this field. 

The Lumarphi arts...  doesn't intend to deal and transact with artists and designers only but also to indulge into the agricultural sector (dealing in mushroom growing and acqua culture). We have partners willing and ready to support us implement this ideology into reality and this will also open up ways to empowerment especially the youth and supply of foods without a limited time frame as production of fish and mushroom and other food stuff will be done constantly.

As the world is advancing, we also move along with it, and for this reason we have a view of not only doing business but also teaching people in order for them not to be left behind in technology. The computer world we are in, no one should be left conputer literate especially those in the rural areas. As Lumarphi arts grows, we intend to carter for everyone and also to be conducting workshops in various places which may seem to be left behind in technology.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Sources of income will be through the businesses run by the firm. 1. Through the arts and graphics, all the artfacts made will be sold (except those for the firm) and designed and printed artworks will attach a fee for designing as well as printing. 2. For the agricultural sector,  all grown food stuff will be sold to generate income for the firm. 3. The education sector will also generate income by attaching payments for the students as they come. As Lumarphi Arts  gets into full operation, none of our partners and members will be left vulnerable as the firm will be generating profits and the community will benefit by adding value to it and through employment and use of the local natural resources where and when necessary. 

The challenge prize will help us set up and put everything into implementation fully. Not only will the firm benefit but the community(s) at large through employment of individuals as well as the youths, and through learning will shall eradicate poverty and unemployment as we get equiped with the latest technology.

> Technical Feasibility

As Lumarphi arts...  I/we have partnered with people who are experts in various fields of the things we want to implement (Educational, agricultural, arts &amp; graphics) with whom we are assured of the best outcome in these fields come what may. 
We have personnel trained in mushroom growing and acqua culture (fish rearing) and they  have done all prcatical experience on minor scale hence the surety of the best out come. With graphics designing as our core idea where also the name is based (arts n' graphics), this field has been running for a while on a minor scale and has been promising of the best once funded enough. 
We have some personnel ready to assume administration duties once fully set and still have plenty of vacancies that will be created in the administration, production and field. 
Lumarphi Arts is open to all despite culture, tribe and/or race or locality (Nationaliy) for as long as we all collaborate and come up together to meet our target goals and the communities demand while offering goods and services in a legal and acceptable manner.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As Lumarphi Arts, we will employ most of the people from the local areas where our business will run from (except where professional experience is required but priority be given to the locals). 

Where their is a will there is way but lack of knowledge leads a lot to perish. We will provide education services (ICT) so that no one should be left behind in the advancing world, keeping people up to date with the best and latest technology. We shall have training for all that will be hired by our firm, not only related the employment been offered but also other survival and entrepreneural skills that will also help them advance in the near future. Education is key and continuous learning to everyone that will be involved with us will be paramount especially entrepreneurship skills and how to monetize the skills that the individuals poses for we believe a person at some point should be able to stand alone without the support of others but stand together with others. 

Continued availability of seasonal foods; when we grow mushrooms, they will be available at any time and any season. Helping the mushroom and other lovers of seasonal foods, for we know that seasonal things and food are expensive, the mushroom will be should at a good and favourable price to accommodate everyone. 

Prices for the goods and services will be offered at a good price without exergarations. Will provide the best quality and services and all will be given at good price
