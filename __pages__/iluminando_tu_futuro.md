> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Yaneth Laffaurie, Saskia Jiménez and Brunilda Perez

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

ylaffaurie@iluminandoelfuturo.com   

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

No, it does not.

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Illuminating the Future is an initiative that began in 2017 with the purpose of educating and promoting the use of renewable energies, bridging the gap in remote communities through the development of various projects, programs, services, and products. This initiative impacts five essential areas: education, rural electrification, youth, agriculture, water, and sanitation. Its fundamental principles and guiding framework are the Sustainable Development Goals, which serve as the foundation for formulating solutions.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

The solution focuses mostly on models, not products or services. However, the replication process could be estimated between 5K and 10K depending on the context.

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype
- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Not focused in technology, but models

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

Little, mostly one community.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

There are no detailed indicators on this yet.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

It is still an initiative at a starting point, therefore, more time is needed before thinking too much into diffusion.
