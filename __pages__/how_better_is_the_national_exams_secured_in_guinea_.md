> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

In the process of information gathering, we used to meet stakeholders that were very afraid to share information because of the fact that the current minister did not allow them to do so. In an other side, we had the minister himself positionned with a new team trying to handle many gaps but those once did not know all the areas of education.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

the only chance for us here was to count on our own relationship. when you have different teams for the same goal and in the same compound who are hiding information among their own links, it become very complex to face the data gathering.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Because of political issue, we were obliged some times to use our own relations to adress the issues. by trying to see there were any common issue addressed already and what was the policy set to face the situation and by the mean time try to understand how the UNDP way trying to support the government?
