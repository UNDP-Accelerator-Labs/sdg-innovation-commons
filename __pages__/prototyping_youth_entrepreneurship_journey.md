## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Prototyping Youth Entrepreneurship Journey
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to test different prototypes within the process of the entrepreneurship journey of Libyan youth from the rural areas.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Libyan economy has been depended on oil revenues since its dependence in 1950s. That managed to put Libya in the middle-income country list for most of the time. However, due to the vast socio-political issues that were accumulated from the armed conflicts since 2011 and the economic recession from the COVID-19 pandemic, many are struggling with financial stability and employment which lead to criminal activities - especially among the youth who are susceptible to join armed groups.   Fortunately, in the recent years, there have been many initiatives in Libya to support the youth to partake business incubator programs to come up with business ideas and plans in order to elevate the youth to become owners of sustainable businesses and improve their surrounding livelihoods. However, according to several observations, many who partake in those business incubator programs reside in the main cities, and the youth from the rural areas and marginalized cities feel left over and has less opportunities to partake and develop their businesses.

This was observed through the many meetings and interviews with national actors working on entrepreneurship initiatives in Libya. Many have expressed concern over the lack of participation from the rural areas and neglected cities. So in order to observe the challenge, the Accelerator Lab Libya team conducted a system thinking session with its experiment partner by describing the typical entrepreneur journey of a young person to apply and partake in one of the business incubator programs and eventually succeed in developing a business plan.  The Accelerator Lab Libya has designed several prototypes that tackle challenges from each process of the journey.  - Challenge 1: Youth from the rural areas are not informed of the existence of the business incubator programs.  - Challenge 2: Many youths from rural areas are not informed of the business opportunities that can be developed in their locations.  - Challenge 3: Some youths from rural areas are not motivated to pursue a business venture because they feel that they are not able to do it. - Challenge 4: The youth from the rural areas are not informed about the opportunities to learn and get mentorship from available business experts.  - Challenge 5: Many youths from rural areas may not have the opportunity to fund or find investors to start their busines ventures.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The experiment consists of testing several prototypes that are embedded in the journey of youth applying for a national incubator program.   The process of the journey starts with informing the youth from rural areas through SMS messages to apply for the program. The SMS messages will contain a hyperlink to access the application form. The application form will ask the applicants only their contact information and residency.   The second process of the journey will be that the applicants will receive a short phone call from the SME where they explain the applicants about the program and suggest business ideas based on a study conducted by SME on the economic sector of the selected locations.   The third process of the journey will be that the applicants will attend a workshop on business plan development that are normally conducted by the SME on the closest location.   The last process of the journey will be for the applicants to upload their newly developed business plan to an online platform where the applicants have the possibility to showcase and get visibility to potential investors.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How we can support the youth from the rural areas to develop a successful entrepreneurial business plan? By tweaking and testing the entrepreneurship programs process through informing, guiding, motivating, mentoring the youth and providing visibility of the business projects.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

To build the capacity of the youth from rural areas, is it possible to tweak the process by only informing, guiding, motivating, mentoring, and providing visibility to the youth in order for them to partake in entrepreneurship programs and succeed in developing business plans?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The prototypes will consist of the following:   -       Informing: Send SMS messages to targeted locations and informing them about the business incubator program, with the contact information and a hyperlink to the application form. The SME will prepare the text message and the application form; UNDP Accelerator Lab Libya will upload the application form to a website.   -       Guiding: Compile a list of opportunities that was collected from field sector studies conducted from the selected locations. The SME will conduct the field study, with the support from the UNDP Accelerator Lab Libya by providing DSA to the data collectors.   -       Motivating: Mobilize SME staff/volunteers to call the applicants for 15-minutes to motivate and guide them to partake the business incubator program. The UNDP Accelerator Lab will monitor the activity.    -       Mentoring: The SME will conduct workshops on business development and mentor the participants. The UNDP Accelerator Lab will monitor the activity.   -       Providing visibility: The successful business plans will be uploaded to an online open-source platform in to showcase their ideas to potential investors. The UNDP Accelerator Lab will develop and launch the BETA version platform in the SME website.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

To perform the "guiding" prototype, there will be an economical sector study to  selected rural locations in order to have a clear data on potential business opportunities in those locations. This data then will be used during the calls to motivate the business programs applicants to pursue the programs.
