> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With proper and strategic planning on my ideas and they're many but I will outline some of the best ideas in line with our current country state and economy. If a right approach can be made towards the following, if honestly believe without no doubt that a better and improved community can be achieved by employing the following business ideas.
1.Woodworkers- it's one of the fast growing small business out there today, making of furnitures is a good business provided the capital is available and a good location, I suggest in the roadsides. With this in place, allot of individuals with skills can be benefactors.
2.Car deteriorate and car wash-  Setting up this with plan standards can earn money everyday. A average car wash fee is k50 and if we are doing 20 per day that is k1,000 multiply by 30 days that is k30,000 monthly.
3.Restraunt and tea cafes-  This has been one of the fast making money for years and today this business is very relevant, the only thing needed is the location( busy working places such markets. A good income can surely be made out of it.
4. Sewing- they are allot of skilled individuals who can be supported to apply there abilities with sewing machines. Setting up this in markets can be great there is is high demand.
5.Interio design for Homes and Offices- Two things are needed to create a powerful impressions, A creative minds, Wich I believe are men ,I myself on the list provide righat materials are available, to create website, Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram accounts where people can sell there art of work. This can bring allot of money.
6. Clothing store, clothing Salaula- Selling clothes in the best business to do, though it comes down with some few challenges like a good location, type and seasons demands but there is no doubt that it has changed people's lives. If we can get all the ideas and suggestions and apply them now, allot of individuals would benefit and a better community can be made.

> Technical Feasibility

Honestly I believe with good intentions that, inoder to work a war, you need other best strategist, people who have been there and they see your point of view and they add or remove something before you take a final step. Every implementation needs a good and selfless approach which I believe is a gift which many wishes to have. Every business proposal needs a capital to start with, something that many individuals strive to have. Some people have that but they lack skill and other it's the opposite, Its good for every Organization weather grv or private sector to have a Goal or a Direction. Looking at the your question and I'm thinking not any other way to answer it rather than the above. Thank you

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our current economy status is showing that things may or may not get better, but If my suggested ideas are implemented, I can assure you that allot of liveshood would be improved, Most of the above ideas are highly relevant and with much effort, I believe much can be achieved. There is never going to be a right time to do business, and we can't wait until the economy is in favor of us then we can wake up and think about doing business. It is from a single or multiple ideas that a business is born.
