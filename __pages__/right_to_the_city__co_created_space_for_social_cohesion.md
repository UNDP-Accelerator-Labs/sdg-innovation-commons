## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Right to the city: co-created space for social cohesion
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that access and participation in cities is unequal in many cities in Uruguay, particularly for young, women and elder people. Caused by socio-spatial segregation this dynamic perpetuates social disparity and inequalities, compromising people´s lives trajectory.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Inequalities to access and participate in cities already existed due to socio-territorial segregation. However, the citizen´s right to enjoy and govern the city is even more threatened considering the disruptions in social interaction that the pandemic implies. Accessibility refers to the ease with which a citizen can overcome the distance between two places and exercise its right to participate in them. A person may have various travel options to many different places, but not to where and when he/she needs to go. Hence, its accessibility is insufficient. This accessibility was particularly affected in the context of COVID-19.   Location of opportunities and human-centered designs play a relevant role. To overcome a distance, people can travel to reach an opportunity; or the other way around, the opportunity can "travel” towards them. For example, public spaces got busier during the pandemic in the urge to spend time outdoors. This evidences the need to bring opportunities closer to the population in an equitable and sustainable way, considering the rights, choices and needs of the population, particularly of those who live in vulnerable and segregated areas of the city.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

There are several open data sources that bring evidence to the relevance and urgency of this challenge and that may help us to learn and experiment in it. For example: geospatial data on open spaces, urban equipment, accessible locations; origin-destination survey, urban wood census and public transport data (stops, journeys, trips, etc). Everything is available in the following website: https://catalogodatos.gub.uy/    The following maps shows some evidence of the urgency of this challenge in Montevideo:  Map 1: Percentage of households with unmet basic needs  Map 2: Location of irregular settlements in Montevideo  Map 3: Places with universal accessibility  There are also datasets regarding a massive and open citizen participation process that the local municipality offers every year.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

There are several signals that exemplifies the urgency of this frontier challenge. First of all, the competition and undemocratic distribution of public space, with priority towards the automobile in travel attraction points (areas and streets with high mobility).  (Picture 1) Secondly, there is a lack of inclusive public spaces that respond to people's needs. This affects particularly to women, youth, older adults, people with disabilities and people with lower incomes. (Picture 2). Furthermore, there are unsafe public spaces, with exposure to road accidents, particularly in school surroundings, intersections and crosswalks. (Picture 3). There is also a lack of incentives for active mobility, which is reflected in the incomplete bike lanes and in the poorly maintained footpaths.  (Picture 4). Lastly, there are inappropriate public spaces for recreational and leisure purposes, specially in commercial areas and suburbs. (Picture 5)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Cities can solve many of the current challenges facing our country regarding to inequality. Investing resources to work on accessibility of the cities, it is worthy because it could help to reduce spatial inequality and poverty in urban and rural communities. It could help to increase shared prosperity and to act for climate action and improvement of the urban environment.  Urban projects are often designed on a scale that does not really capture the way people experience the city and the specific needs of communities. Therefore, our Lab will facilitate the dialogue between citizens and public policies; it will help bring other opinions and new voices that will help understand how people use spaces, their needs, and how they move through them. The Lab will also bring tools based on collaboration and co-creation between UNDP, government, the civil society, the private sector, and neighbors.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Cities and pandemic: co-creating a fairer, greener and more equitable future. Right and access to the city in a fair, equitable and respectful way with the environment can have a positive impact on people's mental health, on the prevention of pandemics, and in social and environmental well-being.

Movés is a project that promotes an effective transition towards efficient, inclusive and low-emission mobility in Uruguay. It is financed by the GEF, implemented by UNDP and executed by MIEM, MA, MVOT in collaboration with AUCI. They are experts in sustainable mobility and are very interested in exploring experiences of tactical urbanism. Therefore we created a partnership to work togehter implementing these experiences.

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation and participatory Design: If we want to create fairer and more equitable cities, it is necessary that they are built together with the neighbors, the people that live in those cities. It is of upmost importance to bring to the conversation all the voices. Therefore, different the co-creation methodologies will be implemented to co-create the cities of the future.   Prototyping: We will test different ideas of tactic urbanism. For that, it will be necessary to prototype fast and cheap and try if they work or not. Also, the first prototypes will be important in order to receive feedback from the habitants.   Visual Thinking & Mapping: the pandemic and the difficult situation in our country forced us to think outside the box and implement new innovation tools to map the city through technology. Therefore, different tools will be implemented to allow a visual thinking through the computer and mapping the city, for example, mapillary.com, a platform that makes street-level images and map data available to scale and automate mapping. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The first that we expect to be benefited from our work are young people and older adults being able to have a fairer access to the city.  The main champions in charge of scaling the solutions will be involved from the very beginning because without them the experiments can’t take place. However, apart from the partners mentioned above, universities and general public may benefit from our work to replicate in the future.
