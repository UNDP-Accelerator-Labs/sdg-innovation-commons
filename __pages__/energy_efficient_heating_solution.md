As the world continues to call for climate action and protecting the environment, the re-use or upcycling of non-biodegradable material remains essential.  90% of the rural population in Eswatini, uses fuel wood as the main source of fuel for domestic purposes (particularly cooking, heating and water heating). As a result, more trees are being cut down leading to erosion the destruction of habitats for wild animals. For the Mbuluzi Game Reserve, like most rural communities, access to modern energy services such as electricity especially for water heating purposes, remains a challenge as modern energy services such as electricity and gas are very expensive, yet the need to sustainably use forest resources remains a high priority. This solution was designed to meet this need while ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources.




The solution was developed by the Mbuluzi Game Reserve Manager working with a local artisan (welder) to provide an energy-efficient, affordable off- normally heated more water than required and needed more fuel wood. This solution provided a more sustainable option which was affordable and easy to make with basic artisan skills. It adapted existing technologies to produce a solution that fits the needs of the Game Reserve, but that could easily serve the needs of households.

Mbuluzi Game Reserve is based in the Lubombo region of Eswatini, and its main aim is to conserve the country’s biodiversity. One of the tourism services offered by the facility in addition to accommodation is a camping facility. Initially, the camp site used a large wood-powered boiler system to heat water for its campers. However, this system proved inefficient and time-consuming as it required a lot of wood even if there were only two campers in the facility. This created the need for a more efficient off-grid system. This solution therefore aims to minimise the use of fuel wood resources to conserve the country’s bio-biodiversity. The water heating system can be made with scrap materials and requires minimum technical skills and can be easily made by local welders.

The main objectives of the water heater solution are:

-        Provision of an affordable (uses scrap material), energy efficient (uses less than a third of the firewood that was used for the old system), easy to make and maintain (has no moving parts), and timesaving (heats water faster) water heating system

-         Provision of opportunities for upcycling scrap metal (from near-by mills),

-        Reduced negative impact on natural biodiversity (particularly the flora or forest), and

Reducing the risk of forest fires through a nearly enclosed system.

 

The water heating system is made up of discarded scrap metals from the nearby sugar factory. The system was designed and fabricated by the Game Ranger and a local retired welder. The structure constitutes of a concrete small shelter to protect the fire word from rain, a small oven-like fire box, a water cylinder, cold water inlet and hot water (shower) outlet. The structure is also fitted with a safety valve to release excess heat/ pressure should it get too hot, as a safety measure.

The system can be used for multiple purposes, e.g., cooking and heating, and possibly baking as it has the properties of an oven, making it easier for campers to prepare food.

What has made it successful is its low cost, use of reclaimed materials, ease of development and opportunity to provide a livelihood. The artisan who fabricates it is now able to make a living out of it.
