> Title of the innovation

Freshwise products Zambia is a start up that is processing vegetables by packaging and freezing them to extend there shelf life and maintain an all year round supply.

> Brief description of the innovation

It is estimated that 40% of horticultural foods in Zambia go to waste due to poor storage and lack of processing plants, this results in an estimate of ZMW 6.5million post harvest losses for farmers. Chain stores like shoprite mainly sell imported frozen vegetables, in turn this creates lack of demand for locally produced vegetables. To address this problem FreshWise products was established, as a start up company that is processing various types of vegetables by packaging and freezing them to maintain an all year round supply. We process, package and freeze the vegetables at the point of harvest to lock in the freshness and add a longer shelf life.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Zambia is currently importing a significant amount offrozen vegetables, is estimated that the frozen food market will reach $4,500,000 (AGBIT). With a growing population of over 17million,Zambia is a growing market for our products.
We at freshWise products intend to reach our target market using a well researched and coordinated distribution channel. Our products will be supplied to chain stores and supplied directly to customers through a partnership with local food deliveries such as tigmoo. The challenge prize will help is to be fully operational and grow our business, our current need is machinery as well as help us to structure our business operations. Our vegetable processing technique will greatly help lessen food wastage in Zambia which is one of the current environmental problems.

> Technical Feasibility

Our frozen vegetables are uniquely processed and packaged using vacuum packaging process. Seasonal foods like sweet potatoes will be processed into French fries and chunks and stored in our cold storage facility for distribution across Zambian chain stores and other markets. This in turn will guarantee a steady supply of seasonal vegetables during off peak seasons. The produce will be sourced directly from the our local farmers at harvest stage and packaged in a 2kg pack. The company was registered in May 2020, we are currently using a home kitchen and for prototype production and working at getting a certification From ZABS. Our key milestone so far have been establishing our brand and working on packaging.
Our next step as a business is to get a office space, and sign contracts for supply of our products to super markets before end of 2021.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our produce will be sourced directly from the local farmers at harvest stage, this will create an available market for the farmers produce. Subsequently helping to reduce food wastage and environmental contamination, our factory will also help create employment for the youths.
