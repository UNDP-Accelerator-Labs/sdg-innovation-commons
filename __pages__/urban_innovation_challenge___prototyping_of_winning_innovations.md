Urban Innovation Challenge — Prototyping of Winning Innovations
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that, based on the identified winners of the Urban Innovation Challenge, there is a necessity to prototype the respective winning proposals in order to determine whether or not they can respectively address the stated gaps in urban development. The gaps in question are the lack of a robust disaster mitigation platform at the regional/municipal level, the lack of an integrated waste management system in central markets, and the reduced accessibility of produce merchants towards household customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

According to Verisk Maplecroft (2021), three of the most populous Indonesian cities (Jakarta, Surabaya, and Bandung) are listed as among the most threatened urban areas by environmental risk in the world, with Jakarta being the most threatened. Therefore, citizens of Indonesia’s major urban areas are prone to hazards such as floods, rising sea levels, etc. Cities should have specific strategies to create resilience against these hazards, and human agency should be placed at the core of the processes of change and transformation. Any action to make a city resilient should also consider and include the most vulnerable members of the urban community, especially those who have the most exposure to hazards. These communities, too, have the agency to transform themselves, becoming grassroots that engage in sustainable development. Through equity, innovation, and stewardship of nature, humanity can break the vicious cycle of social and planetary imbalances. With a strong sense of ‘gotong-royong’—which is rooted in Indonesian values—different actors and stakeholders can co-create social innovations to improve the well-being of the urban community toward a resilient and sustainable future.




In light of this, we established the Urban Innovation Challenge (UIC) to foster innovation towards urban resilience, contributing to the achievement of SDGs, particularly SDGs #5 (Gender Equality), #9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), #10 (Reduced Inequalities), #11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and #13 (Climate Action). UIC intends to harness and scale up grassroots solutions to urban development problems in Indonesia, and empower vulnerable communities to become more resilient.




The Urban Innovation Challenge consisted of three themes—Smart City, Waste Management, and SMEs & Digitalization. We have identified one winning proposals from each category (three winners total):




Smart City: Center for Geomatics Applications for Sustainable Development (CEGAS) with the proposal entitled “Participatory Smart Urban Resilience”.




Waste Management: Forum Kolaborasi Komunitas Peduli Sampah (FOKKALIS) with the proposal entitled “Prevention of Food Loss and Waste in Pasar Kramat Jati Market with the Empowerment of the Local Community”.




SMEs & Digitalization: Sayur Sleman with the proposal entitled “Sayur Sleman”.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Based on preliminary research listed in the proposals of the respective teams:




CEGAS:

·       In 2021 there were 27 flood incidents, 33 landslide incidents, and 30 tornado incidents in the identified target area (town of Slawi, Tegal district)

·       The estimated damages from these disasters is IDR 6-7 trillion, which exceeds the allocated funds for disaster response (IDR 5 billion).




FOKKALIS:

·       According to data from the DKI Jakarta Environment Agency in 2021, Kramat Jati Central Market is the biggest traditional market in Jakarta which contributed around 20% waste (140 tons/day) from total 151 markets under coordination of PD Pasar Jaya.

·       The results of the study from Bappenas in the Environment sector in the period 2000-2019 the emergence of Food Loss and Waste reached 23-48 million tons per year or equivalent to 115-184 kg / capita / year.

·       Food Loss and Waste produces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 1,702.9 Megatons of CO2-equivalent.




Sayur Sleman

·       Based on the results of a survey conducted by the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) on 2,918 respondents in the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY), 2.78% of respondents experienced layoffs (PHK) and 16.22% worked but were laid off.

·       As many as 75.53% of respondents with income below 1.8 million per month admitted to experiencing a decrease in income.

·       Based on a study by BPS DIY in early 2020, economic growth in Yogyakarta is the lowest in Java Island. The poverty rate in the city increased significantly, from 27.1 thousand (2019) to 353.21 thousand (2020).

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Based on preliminary research listed in the proposals of the respective teams:




CEGAS:

·       Based on field survey, local residents lack understanding of disaster response and mitigation procedures

·       Based on observation, the existing disaster system has not effectively reduced disaster risks in the town of Slawi




FOKKALIS:

·       Based on FOKKALIS field observations, fruit and vegetables that are still fit for consumption have been mixed with garbage, causing a large pile of waste. This is because the tenants (traders) have a habit of throwing away unsold fruit and vegetables carelessly when a new supply of fruit and vegetables arrives.

·       The behavior of treating leftover vegetable and fruit products carelessly leads to social problems, health issues and budget waste




Sayur Sleman

·       Seven out of ten respondents who work from home admit that their income has decreased.

·       The SMERU Research Institute in its study concluded that social assistance has not been able to overcome inequality, its coverage is not wide enough, and it is necessary to encourage vulnerable people to move out of poverty.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

As a forefront of innovation within the UNDP network, the Indonesian Accelerator Lab is strategically positioned between grassroots communities, government stakeholders, and innovators—in this case the UIC winners. The Accelerator Lab is working together with the respective teams in the implementation of the prototypes, ensuring that the innovations address the needs of the respective communities served, allowing them to become more resilient and have the agency to empower themselves.




The Accelerator Lab leverages its network in providing this support, by connecting innovators with the relevant CO units. For example, CEGAS and FOKKALIS with the CO Resilience and Reconstruction Unit, which has portfolios relating to disaster mapping platforms and waste management systems respectively.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

(i) What kind of innovative methods are needed in order to address the identified gaps in urban development?

(ii) What kind of measures and improvements are needed in order to ensure that the identified prototypes are able to effectively fill in the identified gaps in urban development?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The winning solutions from the Urban Innovation Challenge process were later developed and co-created with grassroot communities, where they designed proof of concept and implemented prototyping to test their hypotheses and assumptions. To ensure that the solutions fit the root causes, UNDP AccLab built their capacities on ethnography and immersion with local communities and potential beneficiaries. One of the winning solutions also focused on the development of web-based disaster portal that contributes to Smart Cities.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

CEGAS: In the targeted region of Slawi, Central Java, there is yet data on disaster. Throughout the pilot project, the team leveraged their expertise to use geospatial data as a basis for the web-based portal, while initiating new stakeholder engagement with the regional agency for disaster management.


FOKKALIS: In the traditional market of Kramat Jati, there is no existing organic was management system. Thus, the team attempted to develop a systems maps that identifies flow of food waste and loss from vendors to the end collection point in markets to determine gaps and opportunities for a new design.


Sayur Sleman: Building upon their existing social enterprise, the team initiated a background research that collected socioeconomic data of the beneficiaries (fruit and vegetable vendors) as well as users of the service (young urban population). In addition, they conducted customer satisfaction surveys pre- and post-intervention to capture sentiment from users as well as identify areas for improvement in their services.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

CEGAS: The innovation can be adopted by the local disaster mitigation agency (BPBD) and continue as a local hub for disaster response and mitigation. It can also be replicated in other regions, suited to their respective geographic conditions and local needs.




FOKKALIS: The innovation can be adopted by other markets, particularly central markets, in order to reduce food loss and waste that ends up in landfills. If the replication is effective, it can lead to the establishment of a robust waste management ecosystem.




Sayur Sleman: The innovation can be expanded to cover a wider area (i.e. other cities), and the innovator can also work to connect merchants in more markets to local customers.
