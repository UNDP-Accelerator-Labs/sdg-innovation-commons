- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Market research has revealed that the demand for chicken meat has been on the up swing. his is partly due to huge population, and partly due to the fact that chicken is a cheaper source of protein for most Zambians.  However, this demand does not correspond with the supply.  This has on several occasion left customers on the disadvantage side.  As a result customers are left with little choice but to buy poor quality, underweight and expensive chicken from most chicken farmers.  This is especially so to retail buyers who for example want to buy for home consumption.  We realized this need and we want to come in and fill this gap so that our valued customers are supplied with fresh large chickens that meet Zambia Bureau of standards and Zambia, competition and consumer protection commission yardsticks. Our products will meet ans exceed customer satisfaction

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation will be crowned by cooperative members who will also make strategic business decisions. All the management functions such as planning, organizing, controlling, coordinating, directing and general leadership will be done by group members. A Kaizen (continuous improvement) principle and Total quality Management(TQM)  will be a key factor for the success of the company.  Therefore, key inputs from stakeholders such as customers and employees will be utilized in the company’s decision making process.Lusaka has been strategically chosen as the right place to start this profitable business due to among other things, huge market prospects, near proximity to key suppliers and good infrastructure such as roads, communication and electricity. The city has been chosen as we are targeting Lusaka  and surrounding towns.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The birth of this innovation will bring a number of benefits to the economy of Zambia.  The following will be some of the trickle down economic benefitsJob creation to youths. With Zambia grappling with skyrocketing unemployment, our coming on board will be a panacea as we will absorb some youths from the job market especially as the business growsCreation of business to suppliers of day old chicks and feedsTax contribution to the Republic of Zambia.Government needs this tax to buy essential  hospital drugs, build schools, hospitals, road construction, payment of bursaries for university students and other capital/revenue expensesContribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)Creation of hunger for other entrepreneurs to jump into the band wagon and emulate us
