The introduction of the company's new cassava flour product, using locally sourced cassava, will provide increased employment, reduce food loss, and raise people’s standard of living. The process of turning cassava into flour adds value to an already commonly grown crop.

Cassava flour is gluten-free, rich in carbohydrates and Vitamin C, and low in calories, fat, and sugar. It also contains more protein and fiber than white (wheat) flour.

In 2020, Fiji imported approximately $111.4million worth of wheat. A shift to cassava flour by the local market, or occasionally alternating between wheat and cassava flour may mean a slight reduction on the high importation of wheat, as the latter works as a suitable import substitute for wheat flour.
