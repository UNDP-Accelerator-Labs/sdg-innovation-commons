> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

This WiFi hotspot vending machine allows one to connect to the internet for five minutes for as low as Php1.00 only. Filipino hackers managed to flash and reinstall a new firmware from old routers and designed a landing page for ease-of-use.  “This is like putting your WiFi in a sachet," according to Francis Capistrano.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

The need to have affordable and accessible internet.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

The solution is for the public. Most of the users we noticed fall under the youth sector where they use the internet to access social media sites and entertainment sites such as YouTube.  Other users also expressed that they use PisoWiFi to research for school. 

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

The solution matters to the user because internet is expensive in the Philippines and this is their way of sharing the internet to others. This is basically a basic form of the sharing economy.  This also means that internet access is something that people have been looking for.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

The solution has gained traction among the public and business is observed to be brisk. With an investment of Php20,000, one can set up their own PisoWiFi in their homes allowing them to share and monetize their internet to their neighbors who can't afford.
