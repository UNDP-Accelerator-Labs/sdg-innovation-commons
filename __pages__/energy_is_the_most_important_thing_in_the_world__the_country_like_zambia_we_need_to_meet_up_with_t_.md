> Title of the innovation

ENERGY is the most important thing in the world. The country like Zambia we need to meet up with the way we can boasting energy sector more effort in electricity to increase more power hydro station for more increase of electricity power by doing this our country will never involved in loadsheading or lose out power. The others thing is to increase the solar panels installation system to in

> Brief description of the innovation

Briefly l support Energy sector because it will generate and drive all sectors in Zambia to operate all potential businesses in all sectors in export and locally. Zambia has many natural resources it's needs to involve energy sector to work together to generate those resources for example mining companies, agriculture, water companies, education sector and many more needs energy sector to drive their businesses to grow in import and export.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The commencial viability in energy sector  will be increased in our environment due to the increase of electricity power program many people will benefit and make more businesses also people will create more self employed jobs to do businesses in towns and rural areas.
The generate income will be on people's pocket there then people will be able to pay taxes to the government because of their businesses are growing on daily basis. The other implementation plan is target market and potential offtakes, we need to meet up with the things that can increase income production as l  said earlier the increase of electricity power program in Zambia it will  increase more money to people who are interested in doing businesses because in everything we do it's needs energy which is electricity.
The energy sector is the most important part of electricity power to generate businesses in export and locally production in our daily basis.

> Technical Feasibility

The most important part in everything we must do is to create proposed implementation plan to people of Zambia. Zambia needs more information about implementation plan in most sectors like energy sector to create more hydro station to generate electricity power to the people of Zambia. There after we will see many people benefit and do business to implement More Jobs in all sectors because energy sector as increased in hydro and solar system.
The other implementation plan is to look after the youths what we can create for them proposed implementation plan which will make them benefit from this Implementation plan. Number one we need to teach them to be self employed by doing this for them proposed implementation plan it will work, means we have create jobs for them and businesses. Number two we have seen poverty level in our country is high but we need come up with one thing in common by teaching people how to do farming and benefits of farming programs increase income production.
Lastly is clean water as we know water is important to every human being not only people also animals needs water but in our country Zambia in some places people lucky water we need to implement water program by increasing more machines in water companies also in rural areas we implement solar system machines which can generate water for the people.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In energy sector many people will benefit alot and industries, companies, besiness men and women to generate business at daily basis. This will increase more money and more jobs in our country.
