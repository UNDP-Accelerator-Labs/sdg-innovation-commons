> Brief description of the innovation

Airtel/MTN mobile money

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Airtel/MTN mobile money can help many more youths to start up businesses. It's a well known fact that a good number of us youths are earning a living through it, but we have very little capitals. If the new government can allow us to be in groups of maybe 10/10 and give a capital for a certain period of time of three months so that within it, we retain that given capital and then we continue with the profits made. Am sure it can work because we will have leaders in the same groups to monitor the business. Money can be handed in every day so that there can be sanity and order .

> Technical Feasibility

I personally own a booth were I operate from. But I don't have enough capital to boost up my business. So I plead the well wishers and the new government to help me with a K15, 000.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I have been also training and advising other youths to open up with the same and a good number of them have adhered to.
