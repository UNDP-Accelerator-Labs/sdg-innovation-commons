> Description of the solution

A team of scientists led by UCLA has demonstrated a white paint that can reflect as much as 98% of incoming heat from the sun. If widely applied to significantly reduce cooling costs. to cool buildings using passive daytime radiative cooling. Ultra White Paint is a process whereby the building‚Äôs surface is made reflective, to radiate heat out into space. One method to make surfaces reflective is to paint them white. This is the same principle behind wearing a white T-Shirt on a sunny day.
