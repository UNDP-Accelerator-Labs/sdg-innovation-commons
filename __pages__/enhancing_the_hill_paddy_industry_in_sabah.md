> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Enhancing the hill paddy industry in Sabah
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Hill (also known as dryland) paddy has not benefited from the use of agritechnology or improved farming practices (irrigation etc.). As such, the yield of hill paddy remains low. For farmers that cultivate hill paddy, excess rice that is not consumed can be sold at high market prices. However, as yields are low, the amount to be sold is generally low as well. Better yield would provide additional income for farmers as well as strengthen local-level food security.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Most application of technology has been focused on “modern” wet paddy varieties across Malaysia, as the yield and planting area is far bigger than that of hill paddy. This is certainly correct, as wet paddy plays a far larger role in Malaysia’s national food security. However, traditional farming practices remain for heirloom varieties of hill paddy. Hill paddy cultivation also has a cultural context for farmers in the states of Sabah and Sarawak. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Our primary data source was a report by the Khazanah Research Institute. The report highlights some of the challenges in bureaucracy faced by hill paddy farmers and agropreneurs, such as lengthy permit processes, delays in crop variety recognition and limited access to input subsidies.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Issues raised by hill paddy farmers during a rapid site assessment conducted by UNDP and government agencies as well as feedback from a community organization indicated that there is a demand and high market value for unpolished hill rice even at the local level. However, they also raised the challenges in irrigation and technology adoption. There has been less financial and extension support from agriculture authorities for hill paddy farmers due to a policies favouring agro-commodities (such as rubber or oil palm) or other cash crops (vegetables and fruits).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Malaysia Accelerator Lab is focused on bringing whole of government solutions to a range of development issues, and thus are well positioned to bring all stakeholders together for this challenge.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Enhancing Sabah’s hill paddy industry has the potential for increasing the income of rural farmers.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we increase yield of hill paddy and access to markets for hill paddy farmers.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The project is largely designed based on input and technical knowledge of one of our partner (Department of Agriculture Sabah). This agency has already identified policy gaps that can be rectified by findings from the project. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



1. Policy gaps in how rural farmers can access technology and increase market access. 

2. Lack of guidelines on planting hill paddy on slopes over 25 degrees.
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Policy makers at the state and federal level.
