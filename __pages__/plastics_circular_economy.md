## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To determine how a systemic design approach may be able to tackle a complex global frontier challenge such as plastic waste pollution.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If all stakeholders across the plastics value chain work to create a more circular economy for plastics, then there would be a greater chance of successfully tackling the plastic waste challenge, compared to only focusing on the end of value chain or one particular sector.   

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Designing and implementing experiments along the whole plastics value chain.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Sectoral - experiments will be conducted in various sectors in Fiji.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Desktop research Ethnographic interviews Observations through field missions Collective intelligence through systemic design workshop

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

TBD

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

30% of time from Solutions Mapper, Experimenter, and Explorer
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

TBD

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

System design guidebook will be used to help design plastics workshop, which will in turn inform the design of a portfolio of experiments. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

NA

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

TBD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Scale up if experiments are successful. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

TBD

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

NA

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Getting stakeholders to make time in their schedule for ethnographic research interviews,

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Environment, conservation, waste management, sustainability and resilience project teams - results may show areas for collaboration across project teams to address plastics challenge.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government, Private Sector, CSOs, Academia - learnings from this experiment may be grounds for larger scale collaborative actions that tackle the plastics challenge.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

NA

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Utilize a system design approach -  Work with multiple sectors and stakeholders across the plastics value chain - do not focus exclusively on one sector.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

"Sense" and "explore" phases are crucial to the learning cycle of this experiment as it greatly influences the design of the portfolio of experiments.

> What surprised you?

Discovering the important role of under-the-radar stakeholders (informal waste pickers) in the plastics space during ethnographic research.
