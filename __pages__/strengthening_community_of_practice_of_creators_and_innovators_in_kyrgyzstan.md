The creative economy is a fast-growing sector globally, generating considerable GDP revenues and driving employment.  Creative industries provide opportunities for people to think, create, innovate, and design products and services that result in economic value.  The development of creative industries that traditionally were premised on talent, skill, and creativity is now enhanced by the advancement of technology. Creative industries are creating jobs and increasing quality of life as well as promoting inclusive societies.  The creative economy promises significant economic advancement for Kyrgyzstan. Developing a creative economy can help retain the country’s youth and curb high levels of internal and external labor migration.  Over the last few years Kyrgyz Government highly committed in recognizing the potential of creative economy for sustainable development which is reflected in the National Development Strategy for 2018-2040  and National Development Program of the Kyrgyz Republic until 2026.  Both documents underscore the importance of creative economy for inclusive socio-economic development and youth empowerment as well as highlight the necessity of nurturing nationwide innovation ecosystem. The Concept for the Development of the Creative Economy 2022-2026 identifies government priorities in the field such as development of monitoring system and support mechanisms, upgrading educational curriculum and launching creative spaces and platforms for collaboration and co-creation, expanding market opportunities including through the promotion of the national brand “Creative Kyrgyzstan”, and stimulation of innovations due to enabling environment and open dialogue among key stakeholders. In April 2022, President Sadyr Japarov signed a decree “On measures to develop the creative economy and create conditions for progressive development” according to which in June 2023 the Creative Industries’ Park, a special tax regime for creators, was officially launched. According to the Creative Industries Association of Kyrgyzstan, the Kyrgyz Republic is the first country in the world to adopt such a law. The specific types of economic activities eligible for the Park’s membership were officially announced on December 6, 2023.
