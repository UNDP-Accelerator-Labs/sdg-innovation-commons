> Brief description of the innovation

My concern is on us teacher ...the best way to make chance for traine teachers  and those roaming without jobs is by reducing the years of retirement .so that the retirly will go and implement business and us incoming teacher , will also implement some business then that is the best way to create more jobs in Zambia .. at least 50 years old some one should retire to leave chances for income one's it's not teacher  even other ministry should do the same.in conclusion the person who is positive thinking can still make good living within the period mentioned.
