Due to the increased prices of food, including vegetables and fruits, Abu Hassoun family decided to start their small project of Aquaponics farms. Aquaponic farms are a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics — where fish are raised in tanks and the water from the fish tanks is recirculated into the plant beds, so the plants can absorb nutrients from fish waste in the water.


AbuHasoun Family build the closed symbiotic system using simplified design to reduce building and operational costs using locally available materials. 
The project proved to be a success and the family achieved self-sufficiency and created a decent source of income from selling both fish and crops.
