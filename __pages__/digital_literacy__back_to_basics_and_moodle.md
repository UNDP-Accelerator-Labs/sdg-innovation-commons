To explore and map the untapped potential in ‘digital transformation’ that can accelerate action towards achieving SDGs in Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa, & Tokelau. Exploration and mapping of untapped potential in digital transformation for this GAP encompasses citizen participation with digital literacy. It is why the Accelerator Lab has chosen to map selected high schools under the Governance and Poverty Reduction Unit project with the Samoa Information and Technology Association as its initial foray into understanding the potential areas of interest in digital transformation.

Observations: Most of the computer labs visited including all government schools’ in Savaii either had obsolete machines that was only good for MS Office use or the labs were empty with the computers having been cleared out due to damage or non-use. The Accelerator Lab supported SITA in this endeavor by providing 2 routers (i.e. Vodafone and Digicel) for students and teachers to access the internet. However, it is to be noted that the best coverage in most of Savaii is that of Digicel. During the school lockdown when Covid-19 was first declared a pandemic, the schools has manually prepared and printed all learning materials for students which were then dropped off and picked up individual using teachers personal resources. Accessibility to wifi internet was very limited. SITA had also shared that when there is no router available, internet access for the trainings would be via mobile hotspot. Owning a personal smartphone or laptop device is not a priority for most students and teachers. Most of the surveyed are of the expectation that such devices should either be donated or provided by projects. Technology devices such as smartphones and laptops are not seen as another essential tool for education etc.
