Hanger Hacks

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Passing by a tiny shop filled with rows of clothing items that covered all the walls and expanded outwards, I spotted a clearly visible metal pipe that was hanging from the door held by metal wires used as a hanger rack. I was curios to see what other hacks were used to showcase such a large number of items which hung from the top of the walls to the bottom. I noticed there were simple chains that were hooked to pipes which allowed more hangers to be hooked on the chains vertically.
