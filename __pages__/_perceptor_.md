> Title of the innovation

"PERCEPTOR"

> Brief description of the innovation

The "Perceptor" is a hand held device that uses vibration to relief pain or stress using dc motors.It can also be used for recreational purposes such as mediation and can also be used to recharge your phone or mp3 player.It's covers are made with a home made carbon fibre.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The "Perceptor/s" comes in different forms depending on specificity;hand held PERCEPTOR,back PERCEPTOR,head and face PERCEPTOR.And these can be sold or purchased individually,it/they can be used as the main tools for 'massaging facility' and can be booked or rented for purposes.
Anyone capable of operating an electronic device such as phone or mp3 player can us it as it can be used as a power bank for phones etc.
Therefore the support rendered will be used to build a facility for the PERCEPTOR and other innovations of mine to be fully developed.

> Technical Feasibility

The PERCEPTOR is designed in such a way that the vibrations generated are evenly distributed to all parts of its body.And the vibrations can/are concentrated at certain points of its surfaces due to its 'rombus' like shape.
A prototype exists and there others like it that are in development due to demand.Therefore I am trying to start production by selling one or two of those in production.So as to use the money generated as capital to purchase the electronic components and equipments necessary.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The 'PERCEPTOR' innovation can improve the lives of others as;
-It is a health boosting device,and a recreational device that can be used as a source of power to recharge a phone or other electronic device.
-Its development can be a source of employment for the unemployed.
-others will see this innovation and will be inspired to learn more about things they themselves can come up with that will benefit our country and continent.
I have gotten much positive feed back as some people have already tried it and have benefited.For example those with back pains,strains and indigestion.And many have encouraged me to continue with the same spirit of innovation.
