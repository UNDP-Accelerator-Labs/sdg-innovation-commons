SECTION 2: PROPOSED METHODOLOGY, APPROACH &amp; IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Zambia’s educational sector faces two challenges - one among students &amp; the other among teachers. Most students find it difficult to access the necessary information &amp; tutoring they need in order for them to perform well in classes. On the other hand, teacher’s deployment for work does not carter for all teachers – leaving some teachers jobless. 
Therefore, I introduce to you XONED-EDU business initiative an elite &amp; innovative company that will exist to sustainably develop the educational system of Zambia &amp; Africa through technology.

Tutors are required to formulate lesson plans in the ‘Lesson Plan’ Section of their accounts on the Xoned Edu App or Website so learners can easily view their lesson plan offers.


COMPANY OWNERSHIP
Xoned Edu is a business initiative project under Xoned Team Services a sole proprietorship. It will be registered as a Limited Liability Company, which offers liability protection. The project has been on hold due to lack of investment capital.

COMPANY HISTORY
Xoned Edu sealed its perennial need within Zambia &amp; Africa in 2019 in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic &amp; the huge number of undeployed graduates within Zambia’s education system. All schools were shutdown &amp; access to education was entirely limited, there was no solution to curb this tragic development in Zambia &amp; most parts of Africa.
Mr. Ephraim Sinyangwe as a business man &amp; sustainability entrepreneur was deeply disturbed by this tragic development. Though it was not clear to him how this problem could be solved until one of his colleagues Mr. Blesswel Kaonga, a Biomedical Specialist, told him about how he was privately earning from tutoring students who were studying health courses he had already done &amp; was fully equipped to tutor. Then it dawned upon the troubled mind of Mr. Sinyangwe, this was our solution.
The only challenge was making the tutoring services remote &amp; accessible by anyone, the answer was technology. So the two merged &amp; now we have Xoned Edu, the future of education in Zambia &amp; Africa.

Questions are submitted and answered on the platform’s learner’s groups (each tutor’s account will have a learner’s group) or via email. 
Xoned Edu employs the Systematic Analysis Framework (SAF), a problem solving method that students can apply to a wide range of subjects and problems. SAF provides the students with the necessary tools to solve the problem at hand, but also empowers them with a systematic approach to solving future issues.

> Technical Feasibility

SECTION 3: SUSTAINABILTY, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT &amp; RISK PLAN
MARKET ANALYSIS SUMMARY
Xoned Edu exists to provide quality education to every schooler in Zambia &amp; the entire Africa. That’s why we have targeted the entire academic markets:
 
Market Segmentation

Pre-schoolers
These are schoolers who are at least between the ages of 2 &amp; 5.
Primary-schoolers
These are schoolers from grade 1 to grade 7 classes.
Secondary-schoolers
These are schoolers from grade 8 to grade 12 classes.
A-Level Students 
Natural Science schoolers preparing to pursue University / College courses in Natural Sciences.

University / College Students
Post graduate &amp; Under-graduate students
Tutors
Qualified tutors for lessons as per the criteria set by Xoned Edu.
Now, Xoned Edu is designed to provide quality value to all its clients despite the massive size of our target market. Each of these market segments are considered core segments are treated the same. Our team shall ensure that user friendly interactions with the application &amp; website while making sure that all registered tutors pass through the required criteria for them to be fully registered. The 5-star rating system for each tutors will help students access quality services from the best tutors. It is also important to note that every student is entitled to select which tutor they want to learn any lessons from regarding a particular course.
The large percentage learners in Zambia &amp; Africa who are in need of quality education is astonishingly high. Thus, the more reason why we have target the entire academic learning system.

Target Market Segment Strategy
Xoned Edu will ensure targeted markets receive the optimal input required for quality educational services. 
The number of users on our platform will be unlimited so long as users meet the terms &amp; conditions of use- especially the tutors. Zambia’s population &amp; Africa at large is mostly young which req
The undergraduate campus, on the other hand, consists of 1,600 students, so the potential market is ten times larger. The international student population makes up a large percentage of the graduate school of management. The undergraduate non-quantitative segment is difficult and expensive to service because of the variety of courses students could need help with. For now, only the core classes required for graduation are being handled. So, the goal is to maintain the current levels among graduate student segments while over time expanding the undergraduate quantitative segment.
Service Business Analysis
Tutoring has been around as long as students. Thus, the need for the existence of tutors too who in turn earn some income from their services. In Zambia, the ratio of teachers deployed teachers to that of the ones not deployed is quite huge &amp; Xoned Edu will give these teachers leverage to earn from their hard earned skills full time while they await their deployed &amp; part time. 
Though tutors you don’t need to have done an educational course to be able to tutor on the Xoned Edu platform but you must definitely have the necessary knowledge &amp; skills to deliver tutoring services you decide to offer. For example, a professional accountant can create an account as a tutor offering quality accounting lessons on the platform as a part timer &amp; earn some income from that.
Students on the platform can as well decide to become tutors once they have acquired the necessary knowledge &amp; skills in the courses they have been pursuing. This way, they can find that their engagements on the platform were not in vain as they reap the fruits of their labor.  
For as long as students get in over their head, they will need tutors to help them catch up and keep up with their classmates. However, while the need for tutoring exists, the bulk of tutoring taking place in the market is very limited and unorganized. We are set apart as a company in this service is our intentional merging of technology to the educational sector in order to offer quality education. This firmly perpetuates the perennial existence of quality education &amp; Xoned Edu as a company.

Competition and Buying Patterns
Tutors tend to be individuals with a little extra time and specific expertise in a given topic. However, few have the resources to provide a comprehensive tutoring program covering every possible aspect of a course from understanding the material, to getting the best grade possible from a given professor. The majority of competition comes from one-on-one tutoring conducted by friends of the student. There is no organized tutoring service available to students that really covers their specific course from soup to nuts.
As Xoned Edu looks to expand beyond the walls of Zambia to cover the entire continent of Africa, there appear to be few organized competitors. Mostly individual tutors, who do the tutoring in person or online (mostly fellow students in universities &amp; colleges). 
Our role is not to remove such tutors out of the system but to make the system way more advanced &amp; advantageous for both them &amp; the learners through technology. Starting with our Xoned Edu App &amp; website. We will provide a platform designed to provide quality education by allowing tutors to provide their services effectively while maintaining their tutoring skills as an income source. Lessons can either be live or recorded.
Aside from the privilege of choosing who they want to tutor them, students can rate tutors immediately after covering their live or recorded lessons. This grading system obliges every tutor to make sure they offer their best services. Xoned Edu also provides methods of tutoring for the tutors to ensure the best results for their learners, thus, increasing their chances of being highly rated.
The advantages of this approach are:
1.	Xoned Edu merges advanced technology &amp; education to provide quality education in Zambia &amp; Africa, thus, establishing the need for its perennial existence.
2.	A monthly or annual subscription based system for both students &amp; tutors with low subscription rates.
3.	Making equality education easily accessible in times of the COViD-19 crisis.
4.	A well regulated pricing system for courses offered by tutors. 
5.	Proximity: Xoned Edu will utilize online through the Xoned Edu App &amp; Website to ensure their presence carters for Zambia &amp; the entire Africa.
6.	The Xoned Edu App &amp; website are properly designed for easy use by students &amp; tutors which makes it user friendly.
7.	Using the same business throughout the tutoring relationship provides a safe place for students to learn where they are already familiar with what the business is and how it works.
8.	The principle of learning is to open the learner’s mind to the possibility of a better future &amp; Xoned Edu does this through offering quality tutoring services that promotes quality education in Zambia &amp; Africa.
9.	Tutors on the platform will be required to meet standard tutoring criteria for the courses they shall tutor on the platform. This serves as a sieving method for quality service providers
10.	The platform gives its students the ability to rate a tutor’s services upon covering a course with them which gives the tutor a profound obligation to offer their best services.
11.	Xoned Edu provides tutors effective methods of tutoring on the platform that gives them better chances of succeeding in offering quality services &amp; get better ratings from students.
Finally, the cost of the company to offer quality services is well cushioned through leveraging technology. For example, we’ll not need to build learning centers in all parts of Zambia &amp; the entire Africa to ensure we provide quality services to our targeted market segments.
Strategy and Implementation Summary
Xoned Edu will leverage its competitive edge to gain market share. These advantages offer both students &amp; tutors significant value addition economically &amp; psychologically. And without a doubt has a huge impact on the environmental constraints that hinder quality education in Africa. 
The marketing strategy will seek to ensure the ‘future of education’ unfolds within the quality services offered by Xoned Edu. This comes with the company’s inherent unique ability to merge advanced technology &amp; education in order to offer quality education. 
The sales strategy will be the process of converting students &amp; tutors into customers. On the one hand, tutors can begin earning some income part time or full time by subscribing as tutors on the platform. The sessions are either live or recorded &amp; since the business is intended for the entire Zambia &amp; the continent of Africa, who can tell their extent of the income on this platform. Students on the other hand also get to subscribe at a fee monthly or annually &amp; are exposed to a vast array of courses they want to learn &amp; from whom. Tutors are required to formulate trailers of their service offers for learners to browse through before deciding to learn from them. Xoned Edu will also partner with the Ministry of Education in Zambia &amp; other government &amp; private institutions in order for the platform to be able to offer qualification certificates in some courses. Free lessons will also be offered on the platform.
Competitive Edge
Xoned Edu’s unique ability to merge technology &amp; education to achieve quality education in Zambia &amp; Africa makes, thus, ensuring ‘the future of education’ - makes the best in the academic market. Thus, the company’s unique nature as a custodian of ‘the future of education’ deliberately cements its perennial existence. The company’s end to end engagements with both students &amp; tutors will allow both students to attain their expected benefits in bot tutoring &amp; learning. We are differentiated by the following:
1.	Unique end to end engagement with both students &amp; tutors that propagate quality education
 
2.	Individualized service, based on personalized evaluation of each client and his or her specific needs and strengths. This takes into account the recognition that students learn in various ways, some students learn visually, others orally. Xoned Edu first evaluates each student and their best way of learning and recommends the tutor that most effective serve each student.

3.	The option for the student to choose which tutor they wish to learn from after checking their content Ads &amp; reviewing their account.

4.	Affordable monthly &amp; annual subscription for both students &amp; tutors

5.	Free career management services for students &amp; tutors.

6.	Affordable advanced career management services for tutors &amp; students.

7.	The option of one-on-one tutoring or review sessions offered to small groups (enough students so they can learn from each other, but not so many that it becomes confusing and distracting in the session).

8.	There’s no limit to how many tutors or students on the platform. 

9.	Systematic Analysis Framework (SAF) will be applied to all tutoring. SAF is a system where each student is taught to properly approach any type of problem with a systematic method that provides them with the tools of handling problems with a formal problem solving technique, empowering the student to be able to learn more on their own. This is in contrast with most other tutors who assist the student with specific problems or questions. This is short sighted as it only addresses the difficulty at hand, it does not assist the student with problem solving techniques that provide students with tools to assist them in the future with unforeseen problems.
Marketing Strategy
The real key to this business is staying ahead &amp; paving the way for quality education. It is important to ensure that all technological facets that will improve the quality of education are leveraged, innovated or created. This will showcase Xoned Edu for what it is- ‘The Future of Education’. 
The marketing strategy will also incorporate a networking focus where Xoned Edu is in close contact with the students &amp; tutors. This allows the company to be quite familiar with the material the various tutors are teaching &amp; what the learners are being taught.
With advanced technology being Xoned Edu’s business back borne, it’s no surprise then that we intend to leverage digital marketing as our number one form of marketing. We shall also feature in local newspapers, radio stations, TV shows etc. to showcase our elite services of quality education
Lastly, we shall ensure we partner with the Ministry of Education &amp; other government &amp; private institutions in Zambia &amp; countries around Africa. 
Sales Strategy
The bulk of sales come from word of mouth. Learners who will utilize the platform will be expected to spread to good news to other learners regardless of the amount of awareness put out for people to know about Xoned. So past clients provide most of the advertising for the company. Getting seen and getting the word out to new students is always important. One important message to convey is that the tutoring services are not just for slow students who are having a hard time keeping up, 
Our most important message that by merging technology &amp; education Xoned Edu offers quality education through tutoring for anyone who wants an edge and to get the most out of their learning experience. While it also offers tutors an opportunity to earn from their tutoring skills.
Both tutors &amp; students will be free to comment &amp; rate the company’s performance. Free services such as career management for all learners &amp; tutors shall be offered in order to provide qualified leads. Xoned Edu will also sponsor educational scholarships, programs &amp; events that may convert possible customers into paying customers, people that possibly would not have even considered a tutoring service, not previously recognizing their own need for such a service. Because of such offers many "doubters" will be converted into customers.
Seeing that lessons are either live or recorded both the student &amp; tutor are at liberty to tutor at their own pace, unless in situations where it’s a one-to-one sort of arrangement. Learners are also encourage to do live programs in groups are less expensive compare to on-to-one lessons.
Sales Forecast
The sales forecast has been developed to predict future sales in a conservative manner. It is expected that sales will gradually increase as the number of subscribed learners &amp; tutors increases on the platform. Review the following table and chart which details monthly and yearly sales broken down by the various target customers.

This helps the students explore the wide range of tutors to learn from &amp; shall encourage the tutors to provide the best tutoring services.
