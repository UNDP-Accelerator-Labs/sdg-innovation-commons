Collective Intelligence for adapting to water scarcity with farmers communities 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

How collective intelligence can help to find or adapt solutions to water scarcity due to climate change for local farmers in Santa María de Jesús?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Project "Promoting Sustainable and Resilient Territories in Productive Landscapes of the Central Volcanic Chain of Guatemala" is promoting the strengthening of value chains, including local farmers. In the case of the central area and specifically in Santa María de Jesús, in Sacatepéquez, which is a territory already particular, since is located between at the norther skirts of Agua Volcano in a small valley but facing the northern mountains. The territory presents a condition, in which the north winds do not manage to pass through the deviation of the volcano, while the volcano blocks the winds coming from the southern mid coastal territory, which carry out humidity and rain from these other territories. In addition, climate conditions have changed, decreasing the rainfall water, and shortening the rainy season from 6 month into only two.

The Volcano Project is also present in Santa María de Jesús, working through TIKONEL, a civil society organization, on processes to strengthen value chains in vegetables, including organizational, administrative, productive, and marketing matters. Currently they are working with farming communities VEGEXSA and CICODUMA. Currently, the project has supported the vegetable (snow pea) production chain, benefiting a total of 165 people (75 women and 90 men). Farmers have been backed with practices on agriculture, manufacturing, water harvesting, and production practices for commerce. These actions have helped their families, increasing their income through the improvement of production and the national and international marketing of their products. However, the problem on water scarcity, is already a systemic problem in Santa María Jesús, where the agricultural area is managing to strive with water harvesting solutions (even though rainwater is limited), however, the urban area, with a 100% of indigenous population is facing lack of water for domestic consumption.

We’ve searched for information in the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. We have gotten information on precipitation, humidity, and temperature until October 2022. However, this information is available at a departmental level, not municipal, nor by meteorological station.

Even though we are aiming to water scarcity solutions, we’ve found that more information to improve solutions is needed. For example, we found that galvanized sheet is used to collect water, which has a lifetime which when exhausted, generates rust and it detaches, could compromise the quality of the water that is being captured for agricultural purposes.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

By finding and adapting solutions in water management, we will allow farmers affected by water scarcity (due to climate change), to improve their productivity. After the first field visit, we found that the water scarcity is a systemic problem that has been triggered because poor practices such as, a) land usage change without natural resource planning; b) urban sprawl consuming forestry area; c) urban growth with very limited infrastructure for public services; and d) lack of governance mechanisms over natural resources, risk areas, protected areas, streams and rivers exploitation, among others. However, in a granular level we’ve also found these challenges:

• Water demand for irrigation and maintaining soil moisture

• Water demand to cultivate other products and reduce the risk of unforeseen events in monoculture

• Water quality due to capture with aluminum sheets and their lifetime (rust)

• Improvements in the current system

• Use of organic fertilizer practices instead of chemical due to water shortages

• Water for domestic usage in urban area

• Water scarcity stressed by urban growth and same old-limited infrastructure

• Plastics usage in agricultural practices    

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Being resilient to climate change has pushed local farmers in Santa María, to build with their hands and ingenuity solutions to harvest water. We call this collective intelligence, and we invite you to discover with us how we can build more solutions to adapt to water scarcity.

The Project has a bridge function between UNDP and Lab towards the organization and two farming communities in the territory of interest. We aim that through a collective intelligence process, insights can be internalized and hopefully taken into account for the outline of better policies for the use of natural resources and practices to adapt to climate change.

It is an association (formal degree of organization) that has been formed for around 3 years. Regarding the adaptability in good practices and the operation of harvesting rainwater, it has allowed them to improve the quality of the product. Today they fertilize 3 times a week instead of once, according to the applications necessary to comply with laboratory analyzes and product quality demands. Surprisingly, the water is NOT USED for irrigation or within irrigation systems, it is only used in applications with a mobile and manual pump. VEGEXSA operates in a small valley, in which soil moisture has been reduced.

The plots of the CICODUMA producers are located on the slopes of the volcano, which implies the following: 

a) Their land still receives moisture from the water collected by “condensation” and by the slope of the land; 

b) The installation of the solutions has been more complex than in flat territory; c) CICODUMA seeks stability, that is, that its operations are based on fixed prices, which leads one to wonder if they are aware of the risks of foreign markets to remain stable in the long run.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How collective intelligence can help to find or adapt solutions to water scarcity due to climate change for local farmers in Santa María de Jesús?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

• Collective Intelligence, we are aware there are many methods of Collective Intelligence, however, the whole process of the Design Studio, has been supported in a Design Thinking Process for us as Labs, and we can also extend it to the farming communities, proposing a smooth and organic process to evolve from empathy to Cocreation and Prototyping low-fidelity solutions options with stakeholders including local farmers.

• We are also aiming to run Citizen Science dynamics to back up the granular data we also need to understand along with stakeholders to evaluate how feasible the ideas and possible solutions might be, even before testing.

• Throughout the whole process we have planned to observe and document, to build Micro Narratives (as Storytelling) of the process itself, but also getting deep into the human side behind the struggles to water scarcity these communities are facing. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We’ve searched for information in the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. We have gotten information on precipitation, humidity, and temperature until October 2022. However, this information is available at a departmental level, not municipal, nor by meteorological station.  

We intend to run a participatory and collective approach with all the counterparts, generating trust as they key element for collective exchange of knowledge, experiences, skills, and other considerations that might help build collective intelligence, including the ancestral knowledge the two communities (associations) of farmers may have on agricultural, cultural, or other practices, considering they are Kaqchikel culture.

Since we are not starting from scratch, we aim to run solutions mapping with counterparts, that may allow them to envision new possibilities, as well as support the co-creation phases with evidence we project on gathering through sensors on weather data collected in their parcels. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We have seen that both farming communities have an appetite for continuous improvement. Co-creation processes have been part of the ways that have responded to water scarcity previously. We then see in these communities the possibility of testing with higher definition prototypes, solutions in aspects that not only improve adaptation to water scarcity, but also its quality or its more efficient use. Costs of improving solutions is a concern that has been around the process so far, however we are working with the Environment Portfolio and the Volcano Project to address those matters, and trough a documented process we can scale this with the Ministry of Environment and Tikonel who also works throughout the central volcano territory with other organizations of farmers.
