## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

VN AccLab main focus in Q3 and Q4 has been on Public Sector Innovation working with key national partners in innovation ecosystem (NATEC, NIC, Hue City Authorities)  .Reflecting on our initial challenge that "government officials in Vietnam often lack opportunities and venues to learn about social innovation and test new policy ideas" we found some key insight in our work with partners as follow: - VNese government officials face a wide range of structural barriers in their effort to practice innovation. Many issues such as lack of capacity building, leadership resources, inadequate salary/compensation, and little to no safety net when met with failure, to a culture of blame. Yet at the same time, there are plenty of sporadic innovators and small initiatives happening all the time in public services that do push the boundaries and move things forward. Though we observe that most of Vnese innovators tend to fare better if they keep a low profile, and only announce their initiatives when they feel confident, early attention seems to be more detrimental more often than not. As early attention can attract harsh regulations and critics killing the space for their budding initiative.  - Consistent and engaged senior Leadership was a highly important component in the successes case and breakthroughs in our projects. It was important that the people pushing for change also was practicing in their behavior, often this was more important than their verbal expression. Leading by example, and choosing the right people for the right job. - Despite the lack of resources, VNese government officials can be highly entrepreneurial and adaptive, they find ways to work around difficult/overlapping regulation environment, raise fund and resources from different stakeholders and still achieve their objective. Yet what we observe is that there are generally 2 camps of officials, 1 who are champions and have the passion for change and will do what it take, 2 is those who have other priority and only engage if they see something in it for themselves. In the case of UNDP interventions, it is so critical to have a gov champion to take forward our cause, UNDP role here is to shine a light (when relevant) on the gov champion initiative to help them gain internal credibility.  - All innovation tools we tested (e.g: systemic design, ethnography, anticipatory governance...) are only useful when they answer to a very specific need of the problem owner. It is extremely ill-advised to prescribe any innovation tools or solutions before having a good talk and being able to assess the partner's needs.   - Some of AccLab Viet Nam failed experiment, e.g: Danang CityLab - night time economy, was due to our own (senior management) obsession with PR, seeking attention to UNDP first and forcing buzzwords on partners. Forcing people to use tools/ideas (that are often peddled by expensive global north consultants) that were not answering to their NEEDS and TIMING. Not only did this wasted resources of UN trusted money, it was also a frustrating exercise that create distrust as it seeks to impose colonial values to those who want none of it.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Structural barriers in public official effort to practice innovation. Many issues such as lack of capacity building, leadership resources, inadequate salary/compensation, and little to no safety net when met with failure, to a culture of blame.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The most important are the tools that allow us dig deeper into data that to articulate unspoken needs and wants. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

All these tools help to create a different perspectives, reframe the challenge and create a safe space for Gov official team to have a more elevated awareness of the issue at hand.
