## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.     Processes like Portfolio Sensemaking, foresighting, building innovation and learning culture etc., employed to strengthen and connect UNDP portfolio, require both mind-set shift and action shift. The sensemaking and generating intelligence depends on intellectual flexibility and humility to look at the current assumptions about the portfolio and acknowledging need for course correction (if situation demands). It needs the leadership support an open culture while balancing the project delivery of previous commitments. 2.     Initiating and holding a conversation on the identity and intent of the UNDP Samoa MCO was the starting point of our intervention and helped in articulating common purpose and an aligned strategy. This enabled colleagues (often for the first time) to think about what the most strategic role for the MCO is to play and reflect on alignment of their current projects with it. A clearly articulated intent and identity statement laid a solid foundation for project portfolio alignment. 
3.     It is an iterative and ongoing process that requires constant revisiting, especially at the review stage of projects and while creating a new pipeline of projects. AccLab initiated this conversation and in its new learning cycle, wants to institutionalize it by empowering programming UNIT incorporate the approach in their working styles. 
4.     Just undergoing through a sensemaking process, foresighting and innovation workshops is not enough. Expanding, deepening, and connecting UNDP's Portfolio requires intentional transitioning from available funding-based projects to creating portfolios based on intelligence generated through the sensemaking process. This process is intense, time-consuming and needs to be directed by the leadership. 
5.     Senior management and program UNITS continuously reaching out to the AccLab with facilitating strategic conversations on strengthening, deepening, and connecting UNDP portfolios demonstrates the need for this work. AccLab has also received positive feedback from colleagues on the usefulness of the process. However, this work is subjective with no immediate results. Thus, we believe there is a need to develop metrics to measure the effectiveness of the process. We are in conversation with the RBAP about the evaluation metrics.

1.     Developing our own capacity – Given the weak delivery, unsatisfactory performance, and low staff morale, building staff’s capacity, and developing strategic thinking was already on the senior management’s priority. The Samoa MCO had scheduled a Portfolio Sensemaking Workshop with the Regional Innovation Center. However, with covid induced border closures, Samoa MCO could not bring in the experts from RIC. Therefore, this work was handed over to AccLab. Not only the AccLab was newly launched, all three members were new to the UN System. This required us to quickly build our own understanding and capacity before we could lead the process for the office. AccLab actively developed its capacity and understanding of the portfolio sensemaking, forecasting etc. processes by seeking guidance from RIC and studying the work done by AccLabs in Fiji, Viet Nam, Turkey, and India and then contextualizing it for Samoa MCO. We were learning on the go and learning by doing.   
2.     Competing priorities hampering urgency - There is a buy-in on the usefulness of the processes like Portfolio Sensemaking, Foresighting, Inclusive imaginaries and Systems and Design thinking etc. and but due to other pressing demands, especially delivery, there is still no urgency among units to take up these exercises in detail. Most of the sessions designed have to also accommodate other office mandates which reduces time and bandwidth for the session. Since this process also does not lead to immediate results, progame UNITS tend to push the sessions for later dates unless it is mandated by the senior management. This also means that AccLab needs to constantly negotiate on time and availability to make sure that these sessions are not just a tick in the box, but are impactful and result in smarter, agile and strategic planning of the upcoming portfolios. 
3.     Old Ways of Working – As the saying goes, old habits die hard. AccLab can only introduce new frameworks of thinking and strategically designing portfolios, but the actual designing of portfolios and delivering programs differently depends on the program UNITS. This gives AccLab little control over the outcomes.

## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Embedding AccLab's learning approach within UNDP Samoa MCO to strengthen project portfolio and accelerate learning. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that currently Samoa MCO is under radar for weak delivery and performance. The existing project portfolios of the UNITS are not strategically aligned and include several disjointed projects. This is leading to the teams being too thinly spread out and despite them doing a lot of work, it is not translating into significant transformational change. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Just after AccLab's launch in early 2021, AccLab team was approached by the senior management to design a two-days staff retreat. They presented us with a few challenges of - UNITS within the MCO operating in silos, disjointed projects within the UNITS and despite teams putting in considerable efforts, it not resulting in transformational impact.  This was also backed by the Global Staff Survey results that indicated low staff morale, poor staff health and wellbeing and a high attrition rate. The unsatisfactory MCOs performance threatens office sustainability and performance in the subsequent years with the backdrop of political crises in Samoa and COVID-19 raging through the world.

The Global Staff Survey 2020 indicated low staff morale, high attrition and poor staff health and wellbeing (burnout) for staff at Samoa MCO. Therefore, investing in staff's wellbeing and empowering them to take decisions was identified as one of the priority areas for the MCO.  The political impasse in Samoa presented an opportunity for the MCO to turn the lens inwards and focus on enhancing staff's capacity development and strengthen project portfolios and project pipelines.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific in the past used to send expert to design and deliver capacity building sessions for the staff at Samoa MCO. These also included strategic thinking sessions like Portfolio Sensemaking and Acceleration Protocol. But with Samoa's borders closed indefinitely due to COVID-19, this option was no longer available.  When AccLab was given an opportunity to design the staff retreat, AccLab ran a mini-portfolio workshop as an experiment to gauge Staffs understanding of the UNDP's offer to the countries it serves, and the role UNDP needs to play in that context. The exercise was well received by the colleagues and AccLab was approached to continue this exercise to help UNITS re-look at their work, team dynamics and opportunities for bringing more innovation and agility to their programming thereby strengthening portfolios and pipelines.   Since AccLab is a new entity, it puts AccLab in a unique position to hold a neutral space and help UNITS take a step back from their day-to-day work to zoom out on the patterns and areas for improvement. By not being loaded with organizational history and past, AccLab is also able to create a safe space for colleagues to voice out their concerns.   In its strategy, AccLab intentionally plans not to design/ implement standalone projects, instead AccLab want to work closely with the UNITS, acting as an innovation engine, and bring learning back to the UNITS to ensure project continuity and promote a culture of learning.  Therefore, interventions like Portfolio Sensemaking and Accelerating Protocol, Foresighting and Innovation sessions are also of strategic importance for AccLab giving up a foot in the door with UNITS at the early programming stage and being involved at early testing level. We understand, through our own research and by conversation with the experts in organizational strategy, that culture and strategy go together. Therefore, our work with staff on aspects of wellbeing and culture will also set a solid foundation for embracing culture of learning and innovation.

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The Innovation Center at the Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific has developed frameworks for strategically evaluating rapidly evolving priority areas of the countries and assessing portfolios relevance for those developing needs.   However, they need champions in the country offices to implement these frameworks and understanding how the design lands with the participants.    AccLab plans to work closely with the RBAP in learning and co-creating these frameworks, contextualizing them as per Samoa MCO's needs and implement them at the country office level.  By using innovative methods like Portfolio Sensemaking, Forecasting, Systems Thinking and Inclusive Imaginaries, AccLab plans to surface the underlying assumptions and gaps in the current planning approach and provide with a new thinking framework that will promote agility and innovation.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Since we are dealing with organizational and team culture, these set of new data help us understand the underlying assumptions and how behavior loops can be broken/ updated. 
## Closing
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The Portfolio Sensemaking and culture work with the UNDP MCO enabled AccLab to understand team dynamics and processes UNITS follow in their programming. This also gave AccLab an opening to establish itself as an innovation lead with strategic outlook. AccLab is now part of the strategic team in Samoa MCO and moving forward, AccLab will act as an innovation engine within UNDP and will assist UNITS in creating a strong portfolio pipeline and integrate pipelines in AccLab’s learning cycles. This way, AccLab will pick up pipeline projects, do exploratory research, find solutions and experiment with quick prototypes. This AccLab’s approach will feed into the learnings and converting pipelines into strong agile programs. This learning challenge has enabled Acclab’s approach of learning fast into UNDP’s way of working and bring a culture of innovation from within
