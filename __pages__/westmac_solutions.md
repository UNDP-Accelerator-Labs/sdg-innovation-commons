> Title of the innovation

WestMac Solutions

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is about value addition – setting up a production and processing plant in Lufwanyama district that will produce capsules, drinks, gel and powder from Aloe Vera locally commonly known as ‘tembusha’; Aloe Vera belongs to the liliacea family and has thick green leaves which contain gel and latex. Manufactured Aloe Vera gel will be used in the food, healthcare, cosmetic, toiletries and the pharmaceutical industries. And the powder will be used for irritated, sunburned, or inflamed skin as it contains salicylates, which are known to relieve pain; it is also high in antioxidants, vitamin C, and other minerals which allow the skin to heal faster. Aloe Vera powder helps to make food and other supplements more bio-available to human beings - soothe skin problems, weight loss, heart diseases and other health problems.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income through selling of manufactured capsules, drinks, gel and powder. Furthermore, the innovation will create income through jobs in form of salaries to the local community and also assist in improving operations of existing businesses by supplying them with gel and powder to use in various manufacturing process. 
The potential off takers of the innovation include individuals in the local community; food, healthcare, cosmetic, toiletries and the pharmaceutical industries on the Copperbelt and beyond. 
The challenge prize will enable this innovation to acquire all the necessary equipment for production and processing. 
The value addition of the innovation to the environment is that its cultivation is primarily done for medicinal and agricultural uses; it grows in sandy soils, hot humid and high rainfall conditions. It is grown in all kind of soils but well drained soil with high organic matter, is most suitable. It grows well in bright sun light. Shady conditions results in disease infestation. It is highly sensitive to water stagnation. The plant grows best when supplied with an excess of 50 cm of rain annually, in nitrogen-rich, alkaline soil. Soil nitrogen should ideally be maintained at 0.40% – 0.50%.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation will comprise of the processing and production sets up. As such, Aloe vera leaves will typically be subjected to a series of processing techniques. For manufacture of Aloe vera leaf juices, processing will take place as soon as possible due to the highly perishable nature of the juice, ideally within 36 hours of harvesting the leaves. If immediate processing is not possible, leaves will be stored in a refrigerated facility. Prolonged storage of the leaves after harvest without refrigeration may result in enzymatic and bacterial degradation of the polysaccharides. Due to concerns over potential carcinogenicity of aloins A and B, filtration (“decolorization”), often with activated charcoal and diatomaceous earth, has become a common practice in the manufacturing of Aloe vera leaf juices. Decolorization will remove a variety of small-molecular-weight organic compounds, including aloins A and B, from aloe vera leaf material.
And the proposed implementation in respect of production is that the Aloe Vera will be grown on a 10hectares land in Lufwanyama district and a processing plant comprising of spray dryer, gel filling machine, harmonization tanks, duplex filters among other equipment’s.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve the lives of others through employment creation to women, marginalized and the youths in Lufwanyama district. The innovation will also contribute to the growth of Agriculture GDP and also contribute towards the healing and restorative properties in human being health conditions. 
The innovation is relevant as the demand of Aloe Vera gel in the current consumer market is driven by its healing and restorative properties, due to which it finds applications in several industries. Apart from this, the other factors contributing to the market growth include scientific research on the health benefits of Aloe Vera based products, rising disposable incomes, supplier innovations. Relevance is further expected to be driven by rising concerns among consumers regarding their health and skin problems, predominantly due to hectic and stressful lifestyles, which is resulting in a shift in consumer preference towards natural alternatives and herbal nutraceuticals. Moreover, growing awareness about consuming a healthy diet that can potentially reduce occurrence of lifestyle diseases such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, is expected to boost demand for aloe vera products in India over the next five years.
