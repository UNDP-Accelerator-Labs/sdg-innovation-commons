Community-based forest management system that promotes conservation and sustainable use of the forest

> Qualitative Results of the Innovation

1. Preservation of cultural heritage: The Batwa community has a unique cultural heritage that includes music, dance, and traditional healing practices. By preserving and sharing their cultural heritage with neighboring communities, the Batwa have helped promote understanding and respect among different cultures. A study conducted in Uganda found that 81% of respondents agreed that Batwa cultural events promote social cohesion and cultural exchange.
2. Improved access to education: The Batwa community has historically faced barriers to accessing education, which has contributed to their marginalization. However, through partnerships with local NGOs and government initiatives, the Batwa have gained access to education, and this has helped bridge the gap between them and other communities. In Rwanda, a study found that the Batwa had the highest increase in primary school enrollment between 2000 and 2010, from 13% to 60%.
3. Strengthening community participation: The Batwa community has been actively involved in community development initiatives, such as natural resource management, health programs, and local governance. Their participation has helped foster collaboration and trust among different communities. A study conducted in Burundi found that 90% of respondents agreed that Batwa participation in community development projects promotes social cohesion.
4. Improved livelihoods: The Batwa community has traditionally relied on hunting and gathering for their livelihoods, but this has become unsustainable due to changes in land use and environmental degradation. Through various initiatives, such as eco-tourism and agroforestry, the Batwa have diversified their livelihoods and improved their economic well-being. A study conducted in Uganda found that 65% of respondents agreed that Batwa participation in income-generating activities promotes social cohesion.
5. Conflict Resolution: The Batwa have played an important role in resolving conflicts between different communities. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Batwa mediators have successfully resolved land disputes between farmers and herders. According to a study by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Batwa mediators were able to resolve 67% of the cases they handled, compared to 36% by non-Batwa mediators.

> Quantitative Result of the Innovation

Quantitative results include the success rates of conflict resolution by Batwa mediators (67%), the decrease in elephant poaching in Virunga National Park, and the economic impact of the Batwa Cultural Experience initiative in Uganda.
