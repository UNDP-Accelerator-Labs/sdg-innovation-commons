This innovation enables to increase the survival rate of trees after afforestation, which supports an environmental greening programs and combat climate change, and desertification through an increased vegetation cover and carbon sequestration.  The suggested solution for the aforementioned problem is a designed structure that could be put around tree seedlings. This product shall also be simple for carriage and application to support extensive afforestation programs, and in line with circular economy (reusable and recyclable). The innovation is a Water box that has a moisture retention capacity (90%), which supports trees survival with a minimum care in countries that do not afford a logistical cost for post afforestation. The product’s colour is intentionally black to reflect sunlight and minimizes the soil penetrating radiation. Also, it has an extension wire mesh of 1-meter length to protect the seedlings from browsing animals. Such innovative methods need to be also affordable and technically applicable for their saleability. The innovation is to be piloted in the moisture scarce lowlands and pastoralist community. The unit cost per Water Box is 6.8USD including all the installation and follow-up costs. This water box’s production could be also a source of employment for small and micro enterprises. Also new SMEs could be engaged with rental services of such moisture maintaining boxes to government, and non-government organizations in the afforestation businesses. This innovation has been tested at experimental state and planning to conduct a medium scale piloting with 10,000 seedlings.
