This is the school management system bulit in python. it works offline and therefore it does not need any internet connection and this enables it to operate anywhere. Schools can record all the information about their libraries, students and more just in one file. This application uses python inbuilt database called SQLite3 which does not require any plugins.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This application will highly be used in the learning institutions such as schools, colleges and universities, therefore there is great chance that it will generate some income from those areas. Most of the learning institutions across the world use online database management system which requires a lot of money for internet connections. Therefore, i have taken this as an opportunity to create an offline application that can work anywhere

> Technical Feasibility

This application has been created in python using its  GUL  library called tkinter and SQLITE3 as the database. This is the first version but i  tried  it  before in console and it worked perfect and this why i have decided to  create it in the graphical user interface which can be installed as a stand alone application

> Anticipated Social Impact

This application will help all the learning institution  across the world to manage their properties such as books, student registrations, continuous assessment management. Moreover , this application can operate in offline mode and therefore save money for schools and colleges which they have to spend on the internet connections
