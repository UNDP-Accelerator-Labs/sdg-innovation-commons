> Description

The Flavors of the North initiative is a group of organized peasant women who are dedicated to producing fresh food, nutritional supplements, pickled vegetables, sweets, jams and some sauces to sell at fairs in the Department of Concepción, in the northeast of the country. It is a team that works well together, with clear leadership and a good working environment between them. The fresh products that they currently sell have a very good acceptance by consumers and are also produced in most of the family farms in this rural area. The dream of this group of entrepreneurs is the amount of being able to improve their production capacity and quality, to occupy the market at the local and national level, with the added bonus of being organic products. Currently they sell these products as a complement, but they do not have sufficient quantity and quality because they do not have equipment (processing machines) and they do not know the appropriate techniques to prepare and package them so that they are preserved for a few days. They have their own premises, not very large, but it is the place where they make and process the products, it is located in the town of Arroyo de Oro km 92.5, district of Arroyito, department of Concepción PY.
