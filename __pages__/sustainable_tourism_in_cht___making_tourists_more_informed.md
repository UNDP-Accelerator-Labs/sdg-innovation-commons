Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges is that tourists often lack information on the history of the specific places within the CHT region. To address this issue, one solution that has been identified in consultation with the locals is that the history of the tourist spots should be documented very clearly, consulting relevant literature, and some experts with relevant knowledge should be employed to do so.  This can help increase interest among tourists, particularly those interested in travel, and also make them more mindful about maintaining the integrity of the places they are visiting.
