## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Creating a hands-on experience for government officials to learn about social innovation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that government officials in Vietnam often lack opportunities and venues to learn about social innovation and test new policy ideas.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In 2021, our challenge already regarded government officials’ willingness to learn and adopt innovation. We figured out that despite the lack of time and monetary incentives (government officials are paid exceptionally low), there are still some government officials in Viet Nam that are willing to learn and adopt innovation. These are supposedly the Lab’s champions. However, a challenge remains that there are not enough opportunities and venues for them to really practice innovation. They either lack knowledge, framework, time or supporters who can guide them through a complete innovation process. From the other side, we as UNDP are not always able to find and work with them. That leads to a situation whereby we spend too much time and effort working with people that are not really innovation champions, while the drivers of change are left behind.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

It is a sensitive topic to talk about government officials’ capacity in Viet Nam. Therefore, There isn’t really any official data on this challenge.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The government of Viet Nam has long recognized the need to attract talents to work for the public sector. The definition of talent here refers to not only high intelligence and skills but also creativity and motivation. However, the barriers to talent attraction in the public sector are also clearly pointed out. One of which is the uninspiring work environment that does not induce innovation and kills enthusiasm. Therefore, the government is actively looking for solutions to create a more nurturing working environment so that talents can thrive.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab will provide the government with different solutions that can rejuvenate the working environment to attract, inspire and retain talents in the public sector.  We will do so by creating special government innovation incubation/laboratory programs so that innovation champions within governments can actively learn and apply new tools and practices to their policymaking and policy implementing work.   The Lab should be doing this work because we have the necessary mindset, skill sets and tools to help the government become more innovative that other units don’t yet have. However, we will not work alone. We want to work with other Country Office units and their government partners to co-create an experience that benefits all. After these activities, not only our government partners but the CO colleagues will also understand and be able to practice innovation better.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Vietnam AccLab helps to create a safe space that government officials can have fun creating and experimenting with innovative policy ideas.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we create the most safe and nurturing space for creative bureaucrats to explore and experiment new and citizen-centric policy ideas?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

A regulatory sandbox (or in our case, a policy lab) is a safe place that policymakers can creatively learn and experiment new policy ideas. Other methods such as ethnography and design thinking will help government officials understand their beneficiaries better and from that, design better human-centric policy. Systems thinking will help government officials to design their policy in a bigger system framework and not in silos as they are currently doing. Anticipatory governance is a new approach but will be very relevant for government officials to learn and adopt in such a VUCA world.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnographic data and user journeys will help to identify citizen’s behaviors, based on which government officials can design more human-centric policy. Observation, qualitative interviews and communicational pieces can also help measure how government officials learn and improve their innovation capacity through our journeys with them. Through specific prototyping or specific experiments, we will also help gather new data for government officials to later create better evidence-based policy.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The grow phase of this challenge will be when more and more provincial governments/government agencies adopt innovation practices. The partners that we engage in the beginning (mentioned above) will be the case studies to share and encourage this knowledge spillover later on.
