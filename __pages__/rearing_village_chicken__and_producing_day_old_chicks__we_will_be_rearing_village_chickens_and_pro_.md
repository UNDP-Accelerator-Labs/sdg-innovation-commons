> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation is to Rear Village chicken which will be raying fertilized egg, then we will hatch the eggs to produce chicks for the farmers, who are rearing chickens. the project will be producing chicken meat and chick in the market which has become difficult on the market due to high demand. many farmers are waiting for chicks between three to four months for them to receive the chick in the current market. We will have a hatchery that will contribute to the chicks production in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Most of the farm/ Companies that are in poultry production are over whelmed with the increasing demand of poultry products in the country recently, poultry products being Chicken meat, and day old chicks. Chicken meat is the most source of proteins in house holds and the cheapest among meat hence it being on demand at household level. Many farmers that are rearing chicken have had short of supplier of chicks for them to rear owing to the fact that the producers are overwhelmed with increased demand, prompting the government to suspend the exports of chick to other country till the local market is satisfied. we will produce chicken for the meat in the local market and supplier day old chicks to the farmers, this will in hence the farmers access to day old chicks in their locality.

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype that exist is that which is produced by the Hybrid Zambia (Black Astrolops and Sasol's) this kind of chicken are able to lay fertilized eggs which will be hatched using the incubator. the proposed implementation plan, we will buy the day old chicks from Hybrid-Zambia then we will rear them in a poultry house till they will start laying fertilized eggs  which will be hatched using the incubator then the chicks will be sold to the farmers who are in poultry business. the circle will go on and on, and the chicken that get old will be sold to the community members for meat. We will rear chickens for meat and day old chick suppliers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the turn around time for the farmers in poultry farming in our locality in the sense that they will have their day old chicks readily available hence improving their business, and profitability, not only that they will access the day old chicks at a cheap price. This is relevant to the market looking at the demand for day old chicks on the market, the big companies that are producing have opted to sell their chicks to multinational companies or exporting which has starved the local small scale poultry farmers. this will provide access to day old chicks for the farmers and meat for the people in our locality.
