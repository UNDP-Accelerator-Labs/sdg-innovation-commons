## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Up-Cycling Supply Chain
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in a crisis context, some of the key reasons people do not recycle is the argument that it is not a priority given everything else happening and a lack of effective incentive.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The situation has been worsening over the past 10 years, a general per-occupation with economic and social issues has resulted in environmental issues receiving minimal attention. Yet, an increase in waste related health problems is bringing this problem back to the forefront. Interestingly, Syrian society had a complex societal response to dealing with various forms of environmental waste ranging from recycling used eggshells all the way to old home electronic equipment. Currently, most of this system is dampened in some areas and completely forgotten in others. Due to the working economic situation, the number of informal waste pickers has who are in need of healthy and safe working conditions has increased. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

From the countrywide survey it was shown that there is a huge potential for women and children to participate more actively if proper incentive is introduced and if recycling is made easier or transformed into an experience.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab is designing a new type of shop focused solely on accepting recycled material instead of selling material with packaging. Thus, it is a place to get rewarded for returning or recycling packaging instead of unknowingly damaging one's own health and the environment surrounding them. There were other initiatives in this sphere but most focused on simple awareness sessions and the dual color coded recycling bins. Our approach was to create multiple experiments using various levers to identify whether people responded to colors, automation, physical reward or mere motivation.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
