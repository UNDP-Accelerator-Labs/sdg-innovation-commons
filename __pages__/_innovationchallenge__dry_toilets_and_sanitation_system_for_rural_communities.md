This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge "Innovating together for children and sustainable development", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management. To combat the sanitation crisis and the dangerous consequences of disease transmission, health and hygiene problems, Mosan provides a complete, climate-positive sanitation solution, a human excreta collection service and its transport to Mosan Transformation centers. All solutions of the challenge had a great potential, however, MOSAN has all the characteristics of an innovative solution for sustainable development for Guatemala and many other communities that need sanitation, clean water, and health conditions. So far, this solution is already contributing to the community of Santa Catarina Palopó, providing an alternative management for human organic waste, and preventing polluted water and material be thrown at Lake Atitlan.
