## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

13 March 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Nature, Climate, Energy

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Economic growth, small business creation, unemployment

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Is seaweed aquaculture an untapped business/economic opportunity on the coastline of South Africa, that could also contribute to the SDGs

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (Trial and erros, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Seaweed Resource Institute, Japan

Japan Cabinet Office
## 
****
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can we identify the species, location, and cultivation techniques for small-scale seaweed aquaculture that would be feasible and sustainable 

The objectives of this challenge were to identify the most suitable species for cultivation based on market opportunities in Japan, grow rates, ease of cultivation, and opportunities for the development of local markets for offtake. The longer-term aim is to capacitate entrepreneurs and small, micro and medium-sized enterprises 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we identify the species, location, and cultivation techniques for small-scale seaweed aquaculture then this could form the basis of a feasible and sustainable seaweed industry in the country

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The next phase of this project will be seaweed cultivation in Saldanha Bay. We will partner with local organizations to test growth rates and water quality and comparing vertical and horizontal rope cultivation techniques. We will also be engaging communities in cultivation training and a bottom-up approach to local value chain development.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

seaweed cultivation 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Experimental data and lab reports on seaweed cultivation

Physical observation and monitoring

Interviews and focus groups with communites

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 year

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
