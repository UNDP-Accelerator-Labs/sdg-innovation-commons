Income can generate through, production of farming or the system of agriculture, which can improve the businesses of marketeers and also the buyers they can afford to buy whatever they want.If the production of agriculture is available more people including poor people can be afford to buy something, for example mealie meal.

We need to have more, business institution in order to have more income,for example market industries, air ports and stadiums which can bring more income from different countries.

My innovation can improve, to others through agriculture in order to reduce poverty in our country.The only challenge is, they depend on each other instead of working themselves, one can reduce poverty if they don't depend to the government or to the other people, so if the production of farming increases and more people can not suffer because the food is available and can afford to buy nutritious food because it can be cheap and affordable.This can promote health and physical well being.
