> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Soyabeans  farming project can contribute to community development by employing the local people to work on the farms
we can also do value addition by set up a processing plant to make soya pieces 
and the production of animal feeds

> Technical Feasibility

we are following technology way kind of farming 
as such we need to purchase tractors to maximise production

> Anticipated Social Impact

setup a plant for for processing animal feeds hence jobs creation for the people
