> Title of the innovation

Piezoelectricity

> Brief description of the innovation

Piezoelectricity.
This project will help to generate electricity using foot steps.
We will install piezoes under the paves along the roads and busy places like markets. Once someone steps on the paves electricity is been generated.
I have attached a short video which explains more about this project. 
Thanks.
