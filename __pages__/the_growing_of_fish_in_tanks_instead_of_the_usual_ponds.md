The Growing of Fish in Tanks instead of the usual Ponds

> Brief description of the innovation

Growing of fish in tanks as oppose to the traditional ponds is a much safer way to culture your fish. 
First you need to construct a pond using bricks and mortar of size 20m long, 10m wide and depth of 1.5m to 2m. When the pond is filled with water, introduction of solar powered airators is a must as this ensures continuous supply of the much needed air for the fish. Instead of the usual 3 to 5 fish per square meter stocking density, we use the 50 to 100 stocking density depending on the size of the airators. This method has been proven to be the best as it maximizes the profit whilst ensuring security and more fish is stored in a small area. Feeding of fish at regular intervals is also a must, so there must be adequate supply of the feed to meet the demand.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This growing of fish in tanks maximizes on the stocking density and at the same time uses a much smaller area for the said production. Because the area of operation is small, it is easy to secure the area from predictors and theft. In the production cycle you don't require a lot of workers to be on the payroll. One worker can work during the day and the other during the night. If we take the highest figure in the stocking density which is 100 fish/m² it shows us that 20,000 plus fish can be stocked in this tank were as it wil take a pond the size of 50m by 80m to stock the same number of fish.
In this country and the region, fish is indeed in short supply. Our number one target market are the small scale butcheries in the country and also those that are in the business of delivering to distant places. We also intend to supply in Supermarkets. For us to be able to meet the expectation of supplying in Supermarkets we Will introduce packaging and branding. We will also introduce special cuts like fillets as part of our packaged products.

> Technical Feasibility

The tank is made up of concrete blocks and mortar with the size of 20m by 10m and 1.5 to 2m depth built on an open space to allow for sunlight which is much needed by the fish. The fish in particular is the Nile tilapia which is well known for its taste and fast growth rate. The airators which are a must should be big enough to sustain proper airation to produce enough oxygen in the water for the fish to survive. They should also be run on solar energy to allow for continuous supply of energy in case of power cut. There should also be a standby airators in case of any fault on the one running. About 26,000kg of fish feed is required from the start to the end of the production to ensure the fish doesn't suffer from stunted growth. Thermometers to check the temperature of the water. Two workers should be in place 24/7, one during the day and the other at night.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This system of growing fish in tanks produces large volume of fish on a small area hence the cost of production is low. Also the losses incurred are minimised making the fish to be cheaper and affordable by a lot of people.
The system is very relevant as it helps minimize the existing shortage of fish in the region
