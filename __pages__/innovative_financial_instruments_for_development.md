Innovative Financial instruments for development
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the need to promote and participate in the financial system in the 2030 agenda. Given the gap that exists between the resources needed to finance the SDGs in the world, in a context of significant fiscal deficits, the participation of the private sector and the development of new, innovative financial instruments for development is central, in addition to creativity and efficiency in the management of available public resources.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The main sources of financing for sustainable development in Uruguay come from the public sector and there are few instruments from the private sphere that aim at the SDGs. Despite the potential of innovative financing instruments for development (impact investment, social impact bonds, green bonds, among others), their application is still in its early stages, and they have not permeated most of the investments in Uruguay.  This could be for several reasons:

1. Lack of governance schemes for the implementation of innovative financing instruments for development.

2. Lack of knowledge of the private sector of key concepts such as impact investment.

3. Scarcity of successful experiences disseminated.

On the other hand, in Uruguay there are favorable market conditions for private capital investments: political-institutional and economic stability, involvement of the government, the multilateral sector, and civil society

in the development of a sustainable finance ecosystem.

With the objective of advancing within the framework of the 2030 Agenda, Uruguay applied for the joint program entitled: "Development of the impact investment ecosystem: Reforming market conditions and defining the strategy to finance the transition to sustainable development in Uruguay". Within this framework, it contributed to reconfiguring the conditions of the impact investment market and to the definition of the

financing strategy for the transition to sustainable development in Uruguay.

Furthermore, in December 2021, UNDP and the Ministry of Social Development signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the objective of carry out a pre-feasibility study for a result-based payment bonus in the field of dual education.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value that our Accelerator lab is bringing is:

- The systemic view within UNDP. 

The three clusters in the country office are working on sustainable finance but separately. Within the lab we aim to put the actors together and connect the projects form all the portfolios.    

- From the Acclab, we have a background working on this issue. For instance, in 2021 we developed the first crowdfunding campaign to restore the native forest in Uruguay, where we were able to try a new mechanism of finance for development.

- From the Acclab we generated partnerships with the private sector that contributed with funding for restoration.

- We are working in the construction of the Renewable Energy Innovation Fund that seeks to support Uruguay's second energy transition by transitioning to low-carbon technologies in industry, transportation, the commercial and residential sectors, ensuring universal access to renewable energy and stimulating innovation and competitiveness in the country. It is a financing window that combines private capital and United Nations funds to promote energy transition projects, along with a technical assistance mechanism to help companies validate technologies, business models, and impact measurement.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are working on the development of new financial instruments for development,mapping the sustainable finance system in the country and contributing to the development of the ecosystem.

Social providers, NGOs to be part of the social impact bond. For this pilot, we are working with the NGO ANIMA that has an innovative, free and professional technical educational proposal in a dual format where young people from vulnerable socioeconomic contexts can attend the cycle of Technological Baccalaureate in Administration and Information Technology and Communication. In the last 2 years of high school, the training practices are developed in the training companies, three times a week in the afternoon. In this sense, the educational process is oriented to the development of the necessary skills for the labor and social inclusion of young people.
