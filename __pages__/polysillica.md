> Brief description of the innovation

An alternative solution to the plastic waste  problem the country is facing. Polysillica is a range of alternative construction products produced from waste plastic and sand .  The. Products help rid our environment of this global nuisance and at the same time help create employment for many youth in the society.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

revenue Will be obtained from the sale of  products. Produced from  waste plastic . And also loyalties from the different cooperative groups of youth. That will be trained in the production process, the target market includes people in construction firms and the general public being those that. Are in construction , the   Challenge prize will help I the  fabrication of the machinery required  in production and up scaling .  The innovation impact on the environment is that it helps  get rid of one of the major pollutants (plastic waste) leaving our environment esthetically pleasing

> Technical Feasibility

Plastic waste continues to be  global challenge, over the years recycling has been identified as one of the means to. Help solve that problem . Unfortunately technological constraints have made it difficult for low income countries to participate in this solution, Some of the factors being  high cost of machinery to recycle plastics , or  processes too complex for the common citizens .  Green tech innovation  has designed simple machinery and through research developed  easy to apply technics in the recycling of plastic waste . The plastic waste is one of the main constituents of the alternative construction materials being produced  . The products produced include  pavers , kerb stornes , drainage lining and slabs .

> Anticipated Social Impact

The implementation plan involves carrying out workshops to help train members of the community on the production process , this will help create employment for many people in the country,and help better the lives of  of people ,secondly the innovation will help keep our environment clean and promote healthy lives of the people .
