Successful Tunisia is more than a media, it is a project that aims to promote the culture of success, initiative, work and positive action.
The first "Positive Media" in Tunisia: The concept of "Positive Media" or E-Clearing has recently emerged to cope with the destructive waves propagated daily by the large number of negative news that invade the media scene, particularly the digital scene. In this context, Sucessful Tunisia intervenes as the first "positive media" in Tunisia.
