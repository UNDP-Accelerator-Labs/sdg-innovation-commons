## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Vision 2050 proclaims BE as a key economic sector that will potentially reduce the vulnerability of the Zanzibar economy in order to lift Zanzibaris out of extreme poverty so as to attain upper middle income status by 2050. This is in line with the SDG goal 14 and goal 6 of the African Union’s Agenda 2063, which insist on sustainable uses of oceans, seas, coasts and marine resources for socio-economic development. To make this aspect of the Vision a reality, there is a clear need for the UNDP Accelerator Lab Tanzania to support the growth of the sea-based economy, thereby transitioning Zanzibar away from subsistence-based agriculture, in order to minimise environmental shocks. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As an island state, Zanzibar faces several socio-economic developmental challenges due to its relatively small land size and the fragility of its ecosystems, particularly its marine ecosystem. Zanzibar’s economy is predominately agricultural, comprising crops, livestock and forestry products. In 2019, agriculture accounted for 16.4% of Zanzibar’s GDP. Most of Zanzibar’s crops are seasonal and not fully climate resilient. As a consequence, production and productivity are not certain throughout the year, meaning there is no guarantee of a steady flow of income to the country and specifically to the farmers.  Tourism meanwhile is a major source of foreign exchange for Zanzibar, attracting just over half a million tourists in 2019. Given the substantial economic contributions of agriculture and tourism, any natural or man-made shock has a significant impact on income and food security. Although Zanzibar has made good progress in the reduction of basic needs poverty by approximately 5% in the last five years, the changes have mainly been reflected in urban areas, all of which border the sea. Extreme poverty, however, remains a challenge in rural areas, where a majority of people depend on agriculture as the main source of employment and food security. In this regard, there is an urgent need for the Accelerator Lab to work close with the government of Zanzibar and come up with innovative initiatives that can contribute in diversifying  Zanzibar’s economy through BE.

In Zanzibar’s context, BE covers the sustainable use of the sea, coasts and other water bodies as well as related resources, including underground and undersea waters, for socio-economic development while preserving the environment. The BE policy for Zanzibar has highlighted the five priority  BE areas namely (i) fisheries and aquaculture; (ii) maritime trade and infrastructure; (iii) energy; (iv) tourism; and (v) marine and maritime governance. According to the Zanzibar Statistical Abstract report of 2019, the projected population of Zanzibar in 2020 is 1,671,598 with an annual growth rate of 2.8%. The Zanzibar population is composed of 51% females, and 49% males, 36% of them are youths aged 15-35.  As an island state, Zanzibar greatly depends on the sea, coast and marine resources – the carrier of blue activities – for socio-economic development. About 98% of Zanzibar’s international trade by volume is seaborne. These blue activities contribute to about 29% of the Zanzibar Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employ about one-third of the population. The underutilization of BE sector in Zanzibar has contributed to slow economy growth as majority of population relies on small scale farming or agriculture which is highly affected with the effects of climate change making it less reliable in generating income to the population of youths.  In order to increase the BE sector contribution to Zanzibar economy and improve livelihood the Accelerator Lab will design BE challenge for innovators to implement solutions which will increase utilization of BE in Zanzibar and address barriers facing youths population in the sector.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The challenge will increase investment in BE sector in Zanzibar and therefore increase employment to women and youths and same time address environmental effects due to reliance of agriculture.
