> Description of the solution

A multifunctional variable refrigerant flow (MFVRF) system is finding its way into buildings since it can simultaneously provide space cooling, space heating and hot water. Variant refrigerant flow system which was introduced in the U.S around 2002 has been installed in various types of commercial buildings, including offices, hotels, luxury apartments, low-income multi-family buildings, and universities. It can save energy up to 27.1-57.9% when compared to the variable air volume (VAV) system. VRF systems are well known for its installation flexibility and systematic modularity.
