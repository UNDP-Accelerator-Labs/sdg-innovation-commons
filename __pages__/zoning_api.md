> Description of the solution

The Zoning API offers a solution to build vegetation and productivity maps for variable-rate application of inputs in heterogeneous fields. It enables the creation of productivity maps that measure biomass generation over a selected period to estimate field area productivity. Additionally, it allows for the construction of vegetation maps using vegetation indices to identify the spatial variation and health conditions of vegetation. These maps are essential for enhancing cropland productivity by enabling informed application of fertilizers, seeds, and other inputs.
