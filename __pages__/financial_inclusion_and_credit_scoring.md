Financial inclusion and credit Scoring

> Qualitative Results of the Innovation Solution 

1. Increased agricultural productivity: Juhudi Kilimo's loans have enabled smallholder farmers to access modern farming inputs, such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. As a result, farmers have been able to increase their crop yields and enhance their income. According to a study by the International Food Policy Research Institute, farmers who received loans from Juhudi Kilimo increased their crop yields by up to 46%.

2. Adoption of new farming technologies: Juhudi Kilimo has introduced farmers to innovative farming technologies, such as drip irrigation and greenhouse farming. These technologies have enabled farmers to grow crops throughout the year, leading to increased income and food security. According to Juhudi Kilimo's impact report, over 11,000 farmers have adopted drip irrigation technology, leading to a 40% increase in crop yields.

3. Improved access to markets: Juhudi Kilimo has facilitated access to markets for smallholder farmers by providing training on market-oriented agriculture and linking farmers to buyers. This has enabled farmers to get better prices for their produce, leading to increased income. According to Juhudi Kilimo's impact report, farmers who received loans from the organization increased their income by an average of 37%.

4. Increased financial inclusion: Juhudi Kilimo's microfinance model has enabled smallholder farmers to access credit, which was previously unavailable to them. This has improved financial inclusion among rural communities and enabled them to invest in their farming enterprises. According to Juhudi Kilimo's impact report, the organization has disbursed over Ksh. 14 billion in loans, enabling over 400,000 farmers to access credit.

According to a study by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), microfinance has helped to create over 1.1 million new jobs in East Africa's agriculture sector.

4. Improved Food Security: The increased productivity and expansion of agribusinesses have also contributed to improved food security in the region. According to the United Nations, the number of undernourished people in East Africa decreased from 33 million in 2015 to 28 million in 2019.
