> Title of the innovation

Film/documentary

> Brief description of the innovation

I'm a local film maker who makes local stories and documentaries that lean towards making us a better people and making our proud country known in this craft.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Filmmaking comes from the thousand year old art of storytelling. Stories have the ability to build, unite and and instill truth within people. Investing in telling stories through motion picture will not only create employment for the actors and the crew who will be involved on this production, it will also show and teach the rest of the world the truth about being a proud Zambian. I will use the prize to open a film studio that will produce meaningful stories. These stores are viable commercially in that they can either be licensed or sold to plenty of broadcasters and networks both locally and worldwide.

> Technical Feasibility

My prototype is a short film that has won multiple awards both locally and around the world, the plan is to use the prize to buy equipment and hire a full cast and crew that will turn this amazing short story into a full length feature film. This feature film can then be sold to networks like multichoice who are already interested in the idea.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Great stories always have a way of uniting people. It's the reason cinema halls are mostly packed and nearly everyone owns a TV in their homes. People love to sit and watch a great story unfold. The potential of it wining awards locally and outside the country is also a means of inspiring other young artists coming up from behind us.
