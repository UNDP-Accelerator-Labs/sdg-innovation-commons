> Description of the solution

An energy efficiency obligation scheme (EEOS) is one way for EU Member States to achieve annual energy savings that are legally mandated. Under an EEOS, obligated energy companies have to carry out energy efficiency measures that help final consumers improve energy efficiency. This may include for example improving the energy efficiency of buildings, early replacement of electric motors, and installing energy management systems. In the spirit of a just transition, a share of these measures must be directed to households vulnerable to energy poverty.
