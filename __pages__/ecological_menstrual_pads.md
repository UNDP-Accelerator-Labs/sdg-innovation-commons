MenstruAcción Querétaro is a collective which aims to raise awareness about menstrual education. They tour municipalities in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, where they educate about menstruation, distribute brochures with information, and carry out activities such as making ecological menstrual pads made out of cloth.

The collective has also had an impact on public policy: On May 19, 2022, a reform to Law 7, section 30, of the Queretaro Women's Institute was approved, proposed by the MenstruAcción collective, in pursuit of dignified menstruation for Queretaro women, with the objective of taking into account dignified menstruation in existing laws.
