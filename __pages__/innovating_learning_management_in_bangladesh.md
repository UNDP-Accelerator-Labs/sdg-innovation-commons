1.   Bangladesh, has seen a rapid proliferation of online education, particularly during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, for online-learning deployments via tablets and digital contents, there is a lack of data on learner’s engagement and performance across different groups – for example how girls are faring compared to boys? how is the overall school performance in different areas? how student performance varies subject-wise? where do students place the most effort? – data that can offer valuable trends, patterns, and insights around challenges and opportunities on online-learning models in rural high schools. Through an innovative Learning Management System (LMS), the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab is collecting data on students’ engagement through learning via tablets and digital contents. The LMS tracks hours spent by students on videos, scripts and tests related to the learning contents. The Accelerator Lab is analysing critical data on the learning behaviour and performance of students through the LMS, to better understand what works and what doesn’t work.
