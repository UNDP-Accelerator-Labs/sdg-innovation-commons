> Title of the innovation

Vent splitting device

> Brief description of the innovation

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased need for ventilators worldwide, as the amount of ventilated patients has greatly surpassed the existing capacity. Zambia being a developing country there is uncertainty whether Zambia will have the resources to increase the ventilator capacity. To address the above issue, we have designed the VENT SPLITTING DEVICE. The device has the potential to ventilate more than one patient with a single ventilator. In its simplest form, the connected patients each get the exact same delivered pressures and inspiratory oxygen fraction.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to split the air flow from one ventilator to mechanically support the breathing of more than one sedated patient with different lung capacity and changing breathing needs. When the patients in need of ventilators exceeds the number of ventilators available in a hospital vent splitting device could be easily attached to a ventilator to enable the other stranded patients receive tailored respiratory support.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Vent Splitting Device is Affordable, low power consumption, easy to maintain. The device will empower the dissemination of point of-care diagnostics in resource limited settings, as well as other application.  
The device will lower governments financial burden, invades of increasing the ventilator capacity in critical times where there's financial strain the health care system can opt to go for vent Splitting Device which is cost effective as compared to purchasing a new ventilator. The device is also environmental friendly. QVS is such a big investment and the Innovation itself is one of great importance it we intend to use the prize to perfect the system and produce a working prototype and market it to our potential off takers which is the health care system.

> Technical Feasibility

The design of ventilator connects to the two breathing circuits at one end of the box. A standard Y-connector is used just after both the inhalation and exhalation connection ports, in order to split the air flow for each patient and recombine the airflow, respectively. One-way valves (check valves) are attached to each of the Y-splitters, both on the inspiratory and expiratory flow connections, to ensure there is no contamination between patients and to maintain pressure in the system. Each patient’s breathing circuit has a flow control valve that can be manually controlled to change the air flow from the ventilator to the individual patient. Measurements are made on the expiratory flow with a visual pressure gauge, a pressure port which is attached to a pressure sensor for digital readout, and a flow sensor. The setup contains components are readily available in hospitals, can be bought in medical supply and can be 3D printed as a back up plan, electronics components including the micro controller (arduino).

> Anticipated Social Impact

The vent splitting device will support Zambia’s rapid response to COVID-19 pandemic by offering an emergency solution and cost-effective method of ventilating more patients on a single ventilator at the patient’s point of care diagnosis and accelerating the rollout of patients’ recovery. Shared mode provides a new and effective solution for the allocation and use of emergency and life support medical equipment in emergency Rescue, which may improves the success rate of emergency rescue, and the mode have less ethical risk.
A mechanical ventilator can be considered to be a divisible asset and be shared by more than one patient at the same time. This measure has high probability of saving a large number of patients. A hospital that needs to treat 200 patients in respiratory failure but has only 100 ventilators if we assume that all patients who do not receive a ventilator die and the mortality rate for patients receiving a standard ventilator is 50% then 50% of the 200 patients will survive. With the vent splitting device with individualized key parameters all 200 patients will access the ventilator at the same time and more than 70% of the ventilated patients will survive therefore reducing the mortality rate
