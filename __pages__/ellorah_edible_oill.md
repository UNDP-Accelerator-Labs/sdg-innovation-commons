> Title of the innovation

Ellorah edible oill

> Brief description of the innovation

We have an oil expeller in Eastern province Katete District Garven area, the area has 27 villages with an average of between 300 to 400 people in each village.
We buy sunflower from the local farmers and process it into cooking oil that is later sold at wholesale price to small scale retailers, we also process sunflower into cooking oil for the local communities at a fee, those with excess sale the cooking oil but mostly it's for their domestic use as branded cooking oil is expensive and the price keeps on raising.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As a business we get our revenue from the sale of cooking oil, processing cooking oil at a fee as a service and also from the sale of sunflower cake ( a by product of sunflower processing) to animal feed manufacturers and some to local communities members for their livestock to integrate into their feed for animals.
Our target market for the cooking oil is the local community, local retailers that sale in local markets and in the local communities and also aggrigators from other towns.
Our target market for the sunflower cake are animal feed manufacturers, aggrigators from other countries and a few to the locals for their animal.
The challenge prize will grow the business in that it will enable us develop an out grower scheme, this will increase sunflower production thus will produce more cooking oil and more sunflower cake.
The value addition to the environment is that as we teach farmers better farming practices, they will learn morden ways of farming which we hope will integrate smart agriculture.

> Technical Feasibility

Innovation Design
We hope to work with the local school in the communities, they will help identify pupils who do not meet their financial school requirements, they should have access to a 1ha land the pupil will work with there mothers.
The Problem : High prices of cooking oil in local communities.
Having having lived and worked in the rural communities we have come to understand that farmers try their best to grow sunflower but do not meet the yield potential of the crop this is due to lack of crop production knowledge and the lack of access to hybrid sunflower seed as they mostly use recycled seed.
Proposed implementation plan (Solution): Developing a sunflower out-grower scheme that will provide, or make the access to hybrid sunflower seed easy, teach farmers proper sunflower production management practices and also integrate financial management education to enable farmers have some financial knowledge to better manage their finances.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We hope to identify some schools in the Area, these schools will help us identify 10 pupils (between 15 and 20 years) who do not meet their financial academic requirements, through their agriculture science department at their school. The said pupil with their mother will have one hector of land, we will then teach them how to grow sunflower, provide inputs and monitor production, the 10 pupils with their mothers will work on each field as a team, after cultivation we will process the cooking oil for them, part of their revenue will cover their financial educational requirements and the rest will be reinvested in collaboration with a bank to later work as start up capital when they complete secondary education. This program is to run until the pupil finishes secondary education... One school would grow 10 hectors of sunflower, when replicated in 10 school this would be a total of a 100 hectors, increasing the tonnage of cooking oil produced in the area thus making cooking oil more affordable...This translates to working with a 100 youths and a 100 women in the initial phase... this is a step towards meeting the communties nutritional requirements and well being.
The training is open to all community members but input funding will be limited to pupils and their mothers only.
