Mobile Garden Composting 

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

This one wheel chart traditionally was designed in order to help the farmers to feed the animal. Though I found a very creative redesign of it. The owner of the device has added additional net around the base, and has adopted it for his garden.  
He described that, no longer he has animals, though only fruit trees, and in autumn there are many leaves in the garden. This old equipment was redesigned for the garden; he collects all the leaves and puts them here continuously. The equipment is able to move and come next the the trees, and then move it somewhere where the rain will not flood it. 
The owner described that he lets the leaves compost here, and in spring the compost is put back to the garden of the flowers, vegetables, and fruit bushes and trees.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Natural compost is in high demand, especially for the farmers that grow organic products.  He explained that circular production is very important, and that he reuses the leaves both reducing the waste, as well producing his own resources for organic production. 

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Creative setup from a old tool, to a new purpose - the farmer had in-depth understanding on the circler cycle of the natural resources, as well as was able to add a greater value to his product by reducing the carbon footprints, and lowering the production cost for his flowers, vegetables, and fruits.
