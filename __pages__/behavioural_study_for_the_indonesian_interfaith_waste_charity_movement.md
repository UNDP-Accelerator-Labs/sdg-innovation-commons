## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This study aims to continue understanding the impact of leveraging places of worship as the center for encouraging sorting behaviour. This activity builds upon the work of the Indonesia Waste Donation Movement Program, which is supported by UNDP Indonesia, the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment, and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. It leverages domestic attitudes towards religion and generosity to encourage locals to "donate" their recyclable waste and adopt more sustainable waste management practices.
The research question of this study is is, "Is there any indication that religious messaging influences waste sorting behaviour?" This study also explores three supplementary questions to deepen the understanding and application of behavioural change concerning waste management: 1. To explore people's perceptions and intrinsic motivations regarding waste sorting behaviour; 2. To investigate the types, delivery methods, and content of religious messaging that affect waste sorting behaviour; 3. To examine whether the impact of religious messaging on waste sorting behaviour differs across religious communities. 


> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

The hypothesis is that religious messaging influences waste sorting behavior. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

The need for this study was jointly determined internally within the CO by the Accelerator Lab and the Marine Debris project. UNDP then partnered with Participate, an Indonesia CSO, to conduct this study. The methodology and approach was co-designed with local religious leaders of the places of worship that participated in this activity.


> If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

- Civil Society
- United Nations

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The hypothesis was proven, as the amount of waste collected by treatment groups following the delivery of religious messaging was higher than the amount collected by the control groups each week.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

In an ideal setting, religious messaging holds the potential to enhance waste sorting efforts, potentially leading to a twofold increase in the amount of sorted waste collected.

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment influenced public policy at a national or local level
- Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
- This experiment led to partnerships
