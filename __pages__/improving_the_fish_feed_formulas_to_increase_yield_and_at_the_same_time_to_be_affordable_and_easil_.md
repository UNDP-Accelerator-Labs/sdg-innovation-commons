> Title of the innovation

Improving the fish feed formulas to increase yield and at the same time to be affordable and easily accessible buy all types of fish farmers regardless of location.

> Brief description of the innovation

The details of the way I want to go about with improving feed formulas can be discussed once I am sure that I can be supported with my venture till it's complete.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will be able to engage in aquaculture without worrying about the high prices of feed. By making this formula it will provide many opportunities for small scale farmers to move into the commercial market thereby meeting the fish demand in Zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

The idea is to test the feed. On nile tilapia for a period of 5 months, to compare the amount of feed to the growth rate to avoid all unnecessary processes in the aquaculture industry like that of buy fingerlings every season as it involves the breeding of fingerlings in a separate hatchery.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Once this is achieved more farmers will be engaged in the aquaculture industry creating jobs for zàmbians improving the diet of Zambian from red meat to white meat as fish will be cheaper due to lower prices coming from low costs on feed . This will create a healthy nation.
