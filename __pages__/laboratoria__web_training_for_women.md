> Explain what is it about

Laboratoria is an organization that provides a web development training program to young women who have not had access to quality higher education. In an intensive course, Laboratoria teaches participants to build web pages and applications, as well as helping them prepare for a job at a technology company. The goal is for young women to build successful careers and inspire thousands more women to follow in their footsteps. According to the organization, in Mexico there are more than five million young women who have not had the opportunity to access higher education and are not currently working either. On the other hand, with more and more Mexicans connecting to the Internet, the digital sector is growing and will continue to expand. In this context, the purpose of Laboratoria is to make web programming an agent of change for thousands of young women in Latin America.
