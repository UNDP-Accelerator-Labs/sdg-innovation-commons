Choose Your Light

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Years of unstable electricity has led many Syrians to seek alternative solutions. One that is perhaps the most innovative involves using the existing house wiring network and an old car battery to setup a complete lighting backup system.  This allowed the position of the light source to remain the same. Some homes use old truck batteries to further support a TV and a fridge. Interestingly, the fact that only LED lights (for power consumption) can run on these parallel systems, most users also switched their mainstream lighting to LED.
