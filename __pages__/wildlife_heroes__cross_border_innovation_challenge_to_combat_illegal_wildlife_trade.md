## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



The Wildlife Heroes cross-border innovation challenge allowed us to work with youth as local change agents and find innovative angles to the issue of illegal wildlife trade. While the traditional approach often focuses on law enforcement, the youth participants analyzed the problem after gaining insights from stakeholders both in Thailand and Lao PDR, and shifted their focus to other interconnected aspects - public awareness, communication strategy, as well as livelihood promotion that provide alternatives to illegal wildlife trade. The four finalist teams proposed the following ideas and are now testing them out; the results of the testing are to be presented in September.

- Everybody Has the Same Mom, Coco team presented the idea of Miss Wildlife beauty contest to raise awareness about wildlife conservation.

- Meanwild team proposed the idea of using arts to cultivate an animal conservation mindset among youth 

- Mari team proposed the idea of positive communication to steer local communities away from illegal wildlife trade

- WildVetWildlife team presented the idea of livestock promotion as an alternative livelihood away from the illegal wildlife trade
