				<p className='lead'>The SDG Commons is a resource hub of nearly 8,000 documents created by the UNDP Accelerator Labs, UNDP’s open, globally distributed R&D capability for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
				<p>The SDG Commons grows each day and is AI-powered to help UNDP colleagues quickly know who in the Lab Network is working on what topic, and search, leverage and curate cutting edge and bottom-up insights on frontier development challenges across 114 countries.</p>
				<p>What can you find on the SDG Commons?</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>What We See:</b> Explore the Labs’ notes on grassroots innovations and other solutions</li>
					<li><b>What We Test:</b> Discover notes on the experiments where we learn what works and what doesn't in sustainable development</li>
					<li><b>What We Learn:</b> Explore our curated collection of blogs and publications where we reflect what we learn from action</li>
					<li><b>How We Work:</b> Discover the tools, methodologies and toolkits used or created by the Labs</li>
					<li><b>Next practices for the SDGs:</b> Browse through thematic curated pinboards on R&D development questions such as digital financial inclusion, circular economy, food systems, sustainable tourism.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Our ambition is to open it in 2025 to all changemakers and development actors globally so they can pick up insights, make sense of the knowledge in their own context and accelerate action. It is the beginning of a movement, one that radically sees openness as a tool to shift power and drive systems transformation from the bottom up.</p>
				<p>We hope you will find it helpful. Please share your feedback with us, so we can improve it and make it useful for your daily work.</p>
