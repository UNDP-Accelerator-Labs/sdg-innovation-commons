              Our ambition is to open it in 2025 to all change-makers and
              development actors globally so they can pick up insights, make
              sense of the knowledge in their own context, and accelerate
              action. It is the beginning of a movement, one that radically sees
              openness as a tool to shift power and drive systems transformation
              from the bottom up.
