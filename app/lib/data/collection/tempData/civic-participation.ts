	description: 'Civic participation is both a human right and an enabler of collective intelligence, which in turns favours better governance. Therefore, it has both an intrinsic and an instrumental value. As of late 2025, UNDP examined the work of the Accelerator Labs network that involved innovative forms of civic participation over the period 2019-2025. This examination resulted in a publication, <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17360527">The Edge of Participation</a>. This metaboard gives the reader access to the raw data for that publication: the documentation of the various experiences from the Labs.',

					txt: 'Civic engagement is the process through which people come together, as members of a community, to pursue shared goals. This process can take different forms. It may be geared towards influencing the actions of the state – such as when people organize to provide inputs into policy making. Or it may be more community-focused – for instance, when people tap into local knowledge and relations to generate new solutions to shared development challenges. <br/> In all its different forms, civic engagement is a human right. Protecting people’s ability to meaningfully engage in public life – beyond the delegation of power to office holders – is essential to upholding human dignity and freedom. Civic engagement has, therefore, an intrinsic value. However, at the same time, it also has an instrumental value as an enabler of collective intelligence, which, in the right circumstances, leads to better collective decisions and unlocks benefits for human development.<br/> When people pool together insights, skills and ideas in a collaborative process, their contributions often become more than the sum of their individual efforts. This enhanced capacity – which we refer to as “collective intelligence” – can be very powerful and has always been central to humanity\’s ability to solve problems quickly and at scale. <br/> Civic engagement, by mobilizing members of society beyond the confines of public institutions and by building bridges between communities and public institutions, is a major driver of collective intelligence. By this term we mean the enhanced capacity that is created when people work together, often with the help of technology, to mobilize a wider range of information, ideas and insights. Especially when it is truly inclusive – when it creates space for people from all walks of life to contribute – collective intelligence can have a major impact in harnessing our world’s collective brainpower and unleashing human ingenuity.'

With another simplification, consider the citizenry’s collective intelligence and formalized governance processes as the two main forces that drive this process. The three patterns described above can be classified in terms of the phases of the process where collective intelligence has a role to play.'

Many questions remain wide open, when it comes to the promotion of meaningful citizen participation in public decision-making processes. '
