	title: 'Grassroots agricultural innovation in Africa',
	description: 'Research shows that most innovation is not made by companies or university, but by ordinary people trying to improve their lives, help their loved ones, or simply have fun. A [recent study](https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2023-07/undp_informal_innovation_in_south_africa_final.pdf) estimates one million grassroots innovators – 2.5% of the population – in South Africa alone. This collection looks at the dataset of solutions – related to food and agriculture – mapped by the Accelerator Labs on the African continent. Its goal is to provide intelligence to UNDP\'s plans to incubate thousands of startups with the [Timbuktoo initiative](https://www.undp.org/africa/projects/timbuktoo).',

						'<b>Small-farm appropriate agricultural machines</b>. Most farms are small, but most machines for agriculture are conceived for large, industrial farms. A collection of simple, cheap machines that smallholder farmers can easily acquire and maintain. Solar pumps for irrigation in off-grid areas, pedal-powered cashew nuts peelers, olives presses, locally built and maintained electric mills...',
						'<b>Advanced services to food systems</b>. Innovative services, often tailored for smallholder farmers. Market intelligence, logistics, e-commerce, and so on. Bringing them in line of sight of the farmers is about accelerating the adoption of innovation, rather than its generation.',
						'<b>Smart and precision agriculture</b>. Solutions that bring a smart component to farming in Africa: irrigation based on soil moisture, observation and monitoring with computer vision tech, etc.',
						'<b>Agro-ecology</b>. Solutions available to African farmers to grow crops and livestock in balance with nature. Insect protein as feedstock, paper production from grass instead of timber, organic methods to grow palms, etc.' ,
