A <a target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 cursor-pointer"  href="https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2023-07/undp_informal_innovation_in_south_africa_final.pdf" > recent study </a> estimates one million grassroots innovators – 2.5% of the population – in South Africa alone. Scanning SDG Commons data can give a sense of what grassroots innovators are working on when it comes to inventing, developing, or adopting "green" technology that helps preserve the environment and a stable climate. We started by selecting the solutions mapped on the 58 African countries (about 3,000); next, we used a Large Language Model to select those that aligned with the definition of "green/enercgy/climate tech" used by the Timbuktoo initiative. Finally, we went through about 120 of the solutions most closely aligned with that definition, and created several boards, each one gathering solutions that deployed a specific technological strategy, like "use sensors and actuators to reduce the consumption of scarce agricultural inputs, such as water" or "connect agricultural machines to solar panels to allow for a degree of mechanization even in rural areas where access to energy is problematic." More on the methodology can be found <a target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 cursor-pointer" href=https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/timbuktoo-hub-solutions/blob/main/README.md">here</a>.'

A collection of simple, cheap machines that smallholder farmers can easily acquire and maintain. Solar pumps for irrigation in off-grid areas, pedal-powered cashew nuts peelers, olives presses, locally built and maintained electric mills...',
						'<b>Advanced services to food systems</b>. Innovative services, often tailored for smallholder farmers. Market intelligence, logistics, e-commerce, and so on. Bringing them in line of sight of the farmers is about accelerating the adoption of innovation, rather than its generation.',
						'<b>Smart and precision agriculture</b>. Solutions that bring a smart component to farming in Africa: irrigation based on soil moisture, observation and monitoring with computer vision tech, etc.',
						'<b>Agro-ecology</b>. Solutions available to African farmers to grow crops and livestock in balance with nature. Insect protein as feedstock, paper production from grass instead of timber, organic methods to grow palms, etc.' ,
