	description: 'Modern tourism is a major driver of economic progress. It accounts for 10% of global GDP and employment, 7% of global exports and encompasses a growing number ‎of new destinations. At the same time, if not well-managed, it can bring environmental pressure and deepen societal harms such as inequalities.',

However, UNDP’s own mandates on inclusive growth and a healthy environment often lead it to dealing with tourism. For example, the SDG Value Chain global program supports micro, small and medium enterprises to enhance their competitiveness and aggregate into sustainable value chains. Tourism is one of the sectors it focuses in, notably in the Dominican Republic.'

The report singles out three main axes for intervention: a fit-for-purpose governance of tourism; putting the SDGs at the core of the business model of private sector companies; and new approaches to financing tourism.'
