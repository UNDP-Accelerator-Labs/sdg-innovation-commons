	description: 'In an era marked by protracted crises—ranging from violent conflict and political upheaval to economic collapse and environmental disasters—development models must evolve to remain relevant and effective. The UNDP Accelerator Labs (AccLabs) have emerged as a pioneering force in this transformation, embedding research and development (R&D) practices into the heart of crisis response. These labs promote an experimentation mindset—one that embraces uncertainty, values iterative learning, and centers community knowledge—to co-create solutions where traditional interventions often fall short.',

Notably, 23% of all AccLab capacity is embedded in crisis-affected countries, with half of them located in Africa and the Middle East. This distribution underscores the growing recognition that innovation is not a luxury, but a necessity in fragile contexts where conventional approaches break down.'

					txt: 'This research document explores how R&D is applied in crisis settings by the Accelerator Labs, and is organized around six thematic clusters that reflect both the priorities of local communities and the broader development challenges accelerated by crisis. All thematic areas explored in this research are interconnected threads woven into the broader pursuit of resilience and adaptive development in crisis-affected settings. Whether addressing energy innovation, urban systems, social cohesion, or digital inclusion, these themes reflect how the Accelerator Labs navigate the complexities of fragile environments. Crucially, each thematic focus stems from a foundational shift: promoting a culture of Research and Development (R&D) that embraces experimentation, grassroots intelligence, and learning-by-doing.'

					txt: 'This shift is not incidental. In the absence of stable systems, the Labs fostered new ways of listening, testing, and adapting—creating local intelligence cycles that help communities co-develop fit-for-context solutions. The thematic areas that emerged were not pre-imposed, but surfaced organically through bottom-up exploration and continuous sensemaking. Importantly, no theme stands alone: food security links with governance, digital innovation supports social cohesion, and waste systems shape urban resilience. This interdependence reinforces the Labs’ belief that R&D in crisis settings is a systems challenge—requiring agility, contextual depth, and above all, a culture open to experimentation.'
