It is means as a contribution to the preparation for the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/conferences/ocean2025">Ocean Conference 2025</a>.  This work is highly decentralized, driven by national priorities; nevertheless, common patterns emerge. '

We ran a semantic search in the SDG Commons – powered by a Large Language Model trained on UNDP data to improve accuracy – using the descriptions of the panels as search terms, and manually assigned the best-fitting results to boards of the same name. Next, we looked for emerging patterns. We interpret the latter as opportunities: they reflect that R&D efforts all around the world, despite differences in context, singled out the same approaches as promising to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. We then collected the various instances of each pattern into a board. The raw data for this analysis include not only UNDP\' own R&D activities, but also many innovations introduced by local entrepreneurs and inventors in a bottom-up manner. The presence of many solutions around a pattern is a sign that local innovators, too, perceive that opportunity. We detected the following patterns:'

					'<b>Aquaculture and fish farming</b>. Many coastal communities depend on catching and selling fish for their livelihood, but modern fishing can severely damage marine environments, leading to pollution, biodiversity reduction and ultimately environmental collapse. UNDP is experimenting with aquaculture and fish farming as a way to supply seafood while maintaining a much tighter control on the environmental consequences of doing so. Aquaculture can also be complementary to other economic activities, such as farming, and in this sense increase the diversity and resilience of coastal economies (Bangladesh, Lesotho – the latter for freshwater aquaculture). In freshwater-scarce environments, aquaculture can coexist with agriculture on the same land through polyculture (Barbados). Freshwater aquaculture can also lead to dilemmas about how to allocate water: UNDP is looking into methods to overcome them by using generative AI to simulate the impact of different solutions (Mexico).',
					'<b>Integration between fishing and tourism</b>. The rapid growth of tourism as a global industry is a mixed blessing for coastal communities. It benefits fisherfolk by creating additional, local demand for catch; on the down side, it puts additional pressure on marine environments and often leads to local frictions witin communities. For example, fisherfolk tend to view beaches (and the sea itself) as bases for their operations, where they leave their equipment and even abandon waste. Tourists, instead, see beaches as a tourist attraction, which should be well groomed. UNDP teams in several countries are working on reconciling the two. For example, Mauritius is experimenting on ways that artisanal fisherfolk, with their rich local knowledge can provide services to senior tourists. CONTINUE HERE '
