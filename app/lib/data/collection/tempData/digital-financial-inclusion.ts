And yet, the demand for credit is massive—the credit gap for African small and medium-sized enterprises alone is US$330 billion. Financial inclusion creates access to useful and affordable financial products and services – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance. Technology is being used to deliver financial products and services more cheaply and to more people. But does this move us closer to a world without poverty?',

And beyond individual access to financial services, we’re exploring how digital finance unlocks the latent value of the collective. For example, enabling informal self-help savings groups to digitize their records creates credit scores that can be used to access financing from formal financial institutions such as banks.'

UNDP Argentina’s Lab empowered people living in rural areas to use digital payments and conduct online administrative processes via a network of neighborhood stores called Red Con Vos (“Network with You”). Through these and other collective experiments, the UNDP Accelerator Labs have been working in more than 60 countries using digital tools for driving financial inclusion. With newly generated community intelligence, these innovations are ready to go global.'
