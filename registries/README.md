# The SDG Commons

This SDG Commons Archive is a light-weight, flexible wiki-like platform. This archive compiles all the documentation of the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network Codification Fests and the SDG Innovation Commons. It aims to provide innovation practitioners in public sector institutions with knowledge, skills, tools, methods, principles, and tactics that they can use in their work. This knowledge was developed and compiled by the Network over its 6 years of existance within UNDP.
